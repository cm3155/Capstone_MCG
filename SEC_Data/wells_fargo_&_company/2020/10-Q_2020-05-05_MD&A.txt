Financial Review 

Overview 

Wells Fargo & Company is a diversified, community-based 
financial services company with $1.98 trillion in assets. Founded 
in 1852 and headquartered in San Francisco, we provide banking, 
investment and mortgage products and services, as well as 
consumer and commercial finance, through 7,400 locations, more 
than 13,000 ATMs, digital (online, mobile and social), and contact 
centers (phone, email and correspondence), and we have offices in 
31 countries and territories to support customers who conduct 
business in the global economy. With approximately 263,000 
active, full-time equivalent team members, we serve one in three 
households in the United States and ranked No. 29 on 
Fortune’s 2019 rankings of America’s largest corporations. We 
ranked fourth in assets and third in the market value of our 
common stock among all U.S. banks at March 31, 2020. 

Wells Fargo’s top priority remains meeting its regulatory 
requirements in order to build the right foundation for all that lies 
ahead. To do that, the Company is committing the resources 
necessary to ensure that we operate with the strongest business 
practices and controls, maintain the highest level of integrity, and 
have an appropriate culture in place. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been 

working diligently to protect employee safety while continuing to 
carry out Wells Fargo’s role as a provider of critical and essential 
services to the public. We have taken comprehensive steps to 
help customers, employees and communities. 

For our customers, we have suspended residential property 
foreclosure activities, offered fee waivers, and provided payment 
deferrals, among other actions. We are also rapidly expanding 
digital access and deploying new tools, including changes to our 
ATMs and mobile technology for the convenience of our 
customers. We continue to work with regulatory agencies, 
government officials, and not-for-profit groups to identify other 
ways to assist customers facing financial challenges in the current 
environment. 

For our employees, we have enabled approximately 180,000 

to work remotely. For jobs that cannot be done from home, we 
have taken significant actions to help ensure employee safety, 
including adopting social distancing measures, staggering staff 
and shifts, and implementing an enhanced cleaning program. We 
are also making additional cash payments to employees whose 
roles require them to come into the office. 

To support our communities, we are directing $175 million in 

charitable donations from the Wells Fargo Foundation to help 
address food, shelter, small business and housing stability, as well 
as providing help to public health organizations fighting to 
contain the spread of COVID-19. 

We have strong levels of capital and liquidity, and we remain 
focused on delivering for our customers and communities to get 
through these unprecedented times. 

Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding 
Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational 
Risk Management 
On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order 
with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of 
Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance 
the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the 
Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the 
Company’s compliance and operational risk management 
program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the 
Company works to address the consent order provisions. The 
consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s 
acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s 
adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial 
third-party review of the enhancements and improvements 
provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete 
and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction 
of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined 
under the consent order will be limited to the level as of 
December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured 
on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of 
temporary fluctuations. While our total consolidated assets of 
$1.98 trillion as of the end of first quarter 2020 were in excess of 
our total consolidated assets of $1.95 trillion as of December 31, 
2017, we continued to operate in compliance with the asset cap 
because the two-quarter daily average for our assets of 
$1.943 trillion remained below the asset cap level. We are actively 
working to create balance sheet capacity to lend to and help our 
customers during these unprecedented and challenging times 
created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, on April 8, 2020, the FRB amended the consent order 
to allow the Company to exclude from the asset cap any on- 
balance sheet exposure resulting from loans made by the 
Company in connection with the Small Business Administration’s 
Paycheck Protection Program and the FRB’s Main Street Lending 
Program. As required under the amendment to the consent order, 
certain fees and other economic benefits received by the 
Company from loans made in connection with these programs 
shall be transferred to the U.S. Treasury or to non-profit 
organizations approved by the FRB that support small businesses. 
After removal of the asset cap, a second third-party review must 
also be conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the 
enhancements and improvements.

Overview (continued) 

Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, 
Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and 
Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions 
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders with 
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office 
of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an aggregate of 
$1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters regarding the 
Company’s compliance risk management program and past 
practices involving certain automobile collateral protection 
insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock 
extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company 
submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance 
risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company’s 
internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial 
law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required 
by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-objection 
plans to remediate customers affected by the automobile 
collateral protection insurance and mortgage interest rate lock 
matters, as well as a plan for the management of remediation 
activities conducted by the Company. 

Retail Sales Practices Matters 
In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, 
the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and 
entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, 
in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers 
received products and services they did not request. As a result, it 
remains a top priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive 
action plan that includes making things right for our customers, 
team members, and other stakeholders, and building a better 
Company for the future. Our priority of rebuilding trust has 
included numerous actions focused on identifying potential 
financial harm to customers resulting from these matters and 
providing remediation. 

For additional information regarding retail sales practices 
matters, including related legal matters, see the “Risk Factors” 
section in our 2019 Form 10-K and Note 14 (Legal Actions) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Other Customer Remediation Activities 
Our priority of rebuilding trust has also included an effort to 
identify other areas or instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, 
and implement additional operational and control procedures. We 
are working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. We have 
previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of our rebuilding 
trust efforts and are in the process of providing remediation for 
those matters. We have accrued for the reasonably estimable 
remediation costs related to our rebuilding trust efforts, which 
amounts may change based on additional facts and information, 
as well as ongoing reviews and communications with our 
regulators. 

As our ongoing reviews continue, it is possible that in the 
future we may identify additional items or areas of potential 
concern. To the extent issues are identified, we will continue to 
assess any customer harm and provide remediation as 
appropriate. For more information, including related legal and 
regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” section in our 2019 Form 
10-K and Note 14 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this 
Report.

Financial Performance 
Wells Fargo net income was $653 million in first quarter 2020 
with diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $0.01, 
compared with $5.9 billion and $1.20, respectively, a year ago. 
Our results in first quarter 2020 were impacted by a $4.0 billion 
provision for credit losses and an impairment of debt and equity 
securities of $950 million driven by economic and market 
conditions. Financial performance items for first quarter 2020 
compared with the same period a year ago included: 
• 

revenue of $17.7 billion, down $3.9 billion, with net interest 
income of $11.3 billion, down $999 million, or 8%, and 
noninterest income of $6.4 billion, down $2.9 billion, or 31%; 
a net interest margin of 2.58%, down 33 basis points; 
noninterest expense of $13.0 billion, down $868 million, 
or 6%; 
an efficiency ratio of 73.6%, compared with 64.4%; 
average loans of $965.0 billion, up $15.0 billion; 
average deposits of $1.34 trillion, up $75.9 billion; 
net loan charge-off rate of 0.38% (annualized) of average 
loans, compared with 0.30% (annualized); 
nonaccrual loans of $6.2 billion, down $749 million, or 11%; 
and 
return on assets (ROA) of 0.13% and return on equity (ROE) 
of 0.10%, down from 1.26% and 12.71%, respectively.

Balance Sheet and Liquidity 
Our balance sheet remained strong during first quarter 2020 with 
solid levels of liquidity and capital. Our total assets were 
$1.98 trillion at March 31, 2020. Cash and other short-term 
investments decreased $6.1 billion from December 31, 2019, 
reflecting lower federal funds sold and securities purchased under 
resale agreements, partially offset by an increase in cash balances. 
Debt securities increased $4.4 billion from December 31, 2019, 
predominantly due to an increase in held-to-maturity debt 
securities, partially offset by a decline in available-for-sale debt 
securities. Loans increased $47.6 billion from December 31, 2019, 
predominantly due to increases in commercial and industrial loans 
driven by draws of revolving lines and origination of new lending 
facilities due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
economic and market conditions. The increase in loans was 
partially offset by a decrease in credit card loans primarily due to 
seasonality and fewer new account openings, and declines in 
consumer real estate mortgages and other revolving credit and 
installment loans, as originations and draws of existing lines were 
more than offset by paydowns. 

Average deposits in first quarter 2020 were $1.34 trillion, up 

$75.9 billion from first quarter 2019, which reflected growth 
from retail banking deposit campaigns, as well as the inflow of 
deposits associated with corporate and commercial loan draws. 

Credit Quality 
Credit quality declined due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s effect on 
market conditions, which impacted our customer base. 
Net loan charge-offs were $909 million, or 0.38% 

(annualized) of average loans, in first quarter 2020, compared 
with $695 million a year ago (0.30%) (annualized). Our 
commercial portfolio net loan charge-offs were $324 million, or 
25 basis points (annualized) of average commercial loans, in first 
quarter 2020, compared with net loan charge-offs of 
$145 million, or 11 basis points (annualized), a year ago, 
predominantly driven by increased losses in our commercial and 
industrial loan portfolio primarily related to higher oil and gas net 
charge-offs reflecting significant declines in oil prices. Our 
consumer portfolio net loan charge-offs were $585 million, or 
53 basis points (annualized) of average consumer loans, in first 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Capital 
We maintained a solid capital position in first quarter 2020, with 
total equity of $183.3 billion at March 31, 2020, compared with 
$188.0 billion at December 31, 2019. We reduced our common 
shares outstanding by 38.0 million shares through the repurchase 
of 75.4 million common shares, net of issuances, in the quarter. 
On March 15, 2020, we, along with the other members of the 
Financial Services Forum (which consists of the eight largest and 
most diversified financial institutions headquartered in the U.S.), 
decided to temporarily suspend share repurchases for the 
remainder of the first quarter and for second quarter 2020. This 
decision is consistent with our objective to use our significant 
capital and liquidity to provide support to individuals, small 
businesses, and the broader economy through lending and other 
important services. 

In first quarter 2020, we issued $2.0 billion of Non-
Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred Stock, Series Z. 
Additionally, we redeemed the remaining $1.8 billion of our Fixed-
to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred 
Stock, Series K. We also redeemed $669 million of our Non-
Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred Stock, Series T. 

We believe an important measure of our capital strength is 

the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, which was 10.67% at 
March 31, 2020, down from 11.14% at December 31, 2019, but 
still above our internal target of 10% and the regulatory minimum 
of 9%. As of March 31, 2020, our eligible external total loss 
absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of total risk-weighted 
assets was 23.27%, compared with the required minimum of 
22.0%. Likewise, our other regulatory capital ratios remained 
strong. See the “Capital Management” section in this Report for 
more information regarding our capital, including the calculation 
of our regulatory capital amounts. 

quarter 2020, compared with net loan charge-offs of 
$550 million, or 51 basis points (annualized), a year ago, primarily 
driven by increased losses in our credit card portfolio. 

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans of $12.0 billion 

at March 31, 2020, increased $1.2 billion, compared with a year 
ago, and increased $1.6 billion from December 31, 2019. We had 
a $2.9 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses for loans in 
first quarter 2020, partially offset by a $1.3 billion decline as a 
result of our adoption on January 1, 2020, of Accounting 
Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit 
Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial 
Instruments (CECL), compared with a $150 million increase in the 
allowance in the same period a year ago. The increase in the 
allowance for credit losses for loans reflected forecasted credit 
deterioration due to the COVID-19 pandemic and credit 
weakness in the oil and gas portfolio due to the recent sharp 
declines in oil prices. The allowance coverage for total loans was 
1.19% at March 31, 2020, compared with 1.14% a year ago and 
1.09% at December 31, 2019. The allowance covered 3.3 times 
annualized net loan charge-offs in first quarter 2020, compared 
with 3.8 times in first quarter 2019. Our provision for loan losses 
was $3.8 billion in first quarter 2020, up from $845 million a year 
ago, which reflected an increase in the allowance for credit losses 
for loans due to forecasted credit deterioration due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, and higher net loan charge-offs primarily 
due to the impact of the recent sharp decline in oil prices on our 
oil and gas portfolio. 

Nonperforming assets (NPAs) at March 31, 2020, of 
$6.4 billion, increased $759 million, or 13%, from December 31, 
2019, and represented 0.63% of total loans at March 31, 2020. 
Nonaccrual loans increased $810 million from December 31, 
2019, driven by increases in commercial and industrial, and 
commercial real estate mortgage as the effect of the COVID-19 
pandemic on market conditions began to impact our customer 
base. In addition, real estate 1-4 family mortgage nonaccrual 
loans increased primarily as a result of our adoption of CECL, 
which required the reclassification of purchased credit-impaired 
loans as nonaccruing based on performance. Foreclosed assets 
decreased $51 million from December 31, 2019. For information 
on how we are assisting our customers in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management” section in this Report.

Average earning assets increased $49.8 billion in first quarter 
2020 compared with the same period a year ago. The change was 
driven by increases in: 
• 

average federal funds sold and securities purchased under 
resale agreements of $24.0 billion; 
average loans of $15.0 billion; 
average debt securities of $8.5 billion; 
average mortgage loans held for sale of $6.5 billion; 
average equity securities of $4.5 billion; and 
other earning assets of $3.0 billion; 

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
partially offset by decreases in: 
• 

average interest-earning deposits with banks of $11.3 billion; 
and 
average loans held for sale of $377 million. 

• 

Deposits are an important low-cost source of funding and 

affect both net interest income and the net interest margin. 
Deposits include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing 
checking, market rate and other savings, savings certificates, 
other time deposits, and deposits in foreign offices. Average 
deposits were $1.34 trillion in first quarter 2020, compared with 
$1.26 trillion in the same period a year ago, and represented 
139% of average loans in first quarter 2020, compared with 133% 
in first quarter 2019. Average deposits were 75% of average 
earning assets in first quarter 2020, compared with 73% in the 
same period a year ago. The average deposit cost for first quarter 
2020 was 52 basis points, down 13 basis points from a year ago, 
reflecting the lower interest rate environment, partially offset by 
retail banking promotional pricing for new deposits. 

Earnings Performance 

Wells Fargo net income for first quarter 2020 was $653 million 
($0.01 diluted earnings per common share), compared with 
$5.9 billion ($1.20 diluted per share) for first quarter 2019. Net 
income decreased in first quarter 2020, compared with the same 
period a year ago, due to a $999 million decrease in net interest 
income, a $3.2 billion increase in our provision for credit losses, 
and a $2.9 billion decrease in noninterest income, partially offset 
by a $868 million decrease in noninterest expense, and a 
$722 million decrease in income tax expense. 

Revenue, the sum of net interest income and noninterest 
income, was $17.7 billion in first quarter 2020, compared with 
$21.6 billion in the same period a year ago. Net interest income 
represented 64% of revenue in first quarter 2020, compared with 
57% in first quarter 2019. Noninterest income represented 36% 
of revenue in first quarter 2020, compared with 43% in first 
quarter 2019. 

Net Interest Income 
Net interest income is the interest earned on debt securities, 
loans (including yield-related loan fees) and other interest-
earning assets minus the interest paid on deposits, short-term 
borrowings and long-term debt. The net interest margin is the 
average yield on earning assets minus the average interest rate 
paid for deposits and our other sources of funding. Net interest 
income and the net interest margin are presented on a taxable-
equivalent basis in Table 1 to consistently reflect income from 
taxable and tax-exempt loans and debt and equity securities 
based on a 21% federal statutory tax rate for the periods ending 
March 31, 2020 and 2019.

 Net interest income and the net interest margin in any one 

period can be significantly affected by a variety of factors 
including the mix of earning assets in our portfolio, the overall 
size of our earning assets portfolio, and the cost of funding those 
assets. In addition, variable sources of interest income, such as 
loan fees, periodic dividends, and collection of interest on 
nonaccrual loans, can fluctuate from period to period. 

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was 

$11.5 billion in first quarter 2020, compared with $12.5 billion for 
the same period a year ago. Net interest margin on a taxable-
equivalent basis was 2.58% in first quarter 2020, compared with 
2.91% for the same period a year ago. The decrease in net interest 
income and net interest margin in first quarter 2020, compared 
with the same period a year ago, was driven by unfavorable 
impacts of repricing due to lower market rates and changes in mix 
of earning assets and funding sources, including sales of high 
yielding Pick-a-Pay loans in 2019, as well as higher costs on 
promotional retail banking deposits.

Noninterest income was $6.4 billion, or 36% of revenue, in first 
quarter 2020, compared with $9.3 billion, or 43% of revenue, for 
the same period a year ago. The decrease in noninterest income in 
first quarter 2020, compared with the same period a year ago, 
was predominantly due to lower other fees, mortgage banking 
income, net gains from trading activities, and net losses from 
equity securities, partially offset by higher service charges on 
deposit accounts, and trust and investment fees. For more 
information on our performance obligations and the nature of 
services performed for certain of our revenues discussed below, 
see Note 18 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Service charges on deposit accounts increased to $1.2 billion 

in first quarter 2020, compared with $1.1 billion for the same 
period a year ago, driven by higher overdraft fees and higher 
treasury management fees due to the impact of a lower earnings 
credit rate applied to commercial accounts given the lower 
interest rate environment. Overdraft fees were higher due to one 
additional day in first quarter 2020, compared with the same 
period a year ago, as well as fee waivers and reversals for 
customers affected by our data center system outage and the 
government shutdown in first quarter 2019. As part of our 
actions to support customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, we 
have provided certain fee waivers and reversals to our customers, 
which may negatively impact income from service charges on 
deposit accounts in future periods.

Brokerage advisory, commissions and other fees increased to 

$2.5 billion in first quarter 2020, compared with $2.2 billion for 
the same period a year ago, due to higher asset-based fees and 
higher transactional revenue. Retail brokerage client assets 
totaled $1.4 trillion at March 31, 2020, compared with 
$1.6 trillion at March 31, 2019. Asset-based fees are generally 
calculated on the market value of the assets as of the beginning 
of each quarter. All retail brokerage services are provided by our 
Wealth and Investment Management (WIM) operating segment. 
For additional information on retail brokerage client assets, see 
the discussion and Tables 4d and 4e in the “Operating Segment 
Results – Wealth and Investment Management – Retail Brokerage 
Client Assets” section in this Report. 

Trust and investment management fees decreased to 

$701 million in first quarter 2020, from $786 million for the same 
period a year ago, predominantly driven by lower trust fees due to 
the sale of our Institutional Retirement and Trust (IRT) business 
in 2019. 

Our assets under management (AUM) totaled $693.1 billion 

at March 31, 2020, compared with $661.1 billion at March 31, 
2019. Substantially all of our AUM is managed by our WIM 
operating segment. Our assets under administration (AUA) 
totaled $1.7 trillion at both March 31, 2020 and 2019. 
Management believes that AUM and AUA are useful metrics 
because they allow investors and others to assess how changes in 
asset amounts may impact the generation of certain asset-based 
fees. 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our AUM and AUA included IRT client assets of $19 billion 

regarding our MSRs risks and hedging approach. 

and $797 billion, respectively, at March 31, 2020, which we 
continue to administer at the direction of the buyer pursuant to a 
transition services agreement that will terminate no later than 
July 2021. 

Additional information regarding our WIM operating 

segment AUM is provided in Table 4f and the related discussion in 
the “Operating Segment Results – Wealth and Investment 
Management – Trust and Investment Client Assets Under 
Management” section in this Report. 

Net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities 
decreased to $108 million in first quarter 2020, compared with 
$344 million for the same period a year ago, as gains from higher 
residential real estate origination volumes and margins in first 
quarter 2020 were more than offset by losses driven by the 
impact of interest rate volatility on hedging activities associated 
with our residential mortgage loans held for sale portfolio and 
pipeline, as well as valuation losses on certain residential and 
commercial loans held for sale due to market conditions. 

Card fees decreased to $892 million in first quarter 2020, 

The production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage 

compared with $944 million for the same period a year ago, due 
to higher rewards costs and lower interchange fees driven by 
decreased purchase activity due to the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic on consumer spending, partially offset by strong 
purchase volume early in the quarter. 

Other fees decreased to $632 million in first quarter 2020, 

compared with $770 million for the same period a year ago, 
largely driven by the sale of our commercial real estate brokerage 
business, Eastdil Secured (Eastdil), in fourth quarter 2019 and 
lower business payroll income due to the sale of our Business 
Payroll Services business in first quarter 2019. 

Mortgage banking noninterest income, consisting of net 
servicing income and net gains on mortgage loan origination/ 
sales activities, decreased to $379 million in first quarter 2020, 
compared with $708 million for the same period a year ago. For 
more information, see Note 11 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Net servicing income decreased to $271 million in first 
quarter 2020, compared with $364 million for the same period a 
year ago driven by a decrease in contractually specified fees as a 
result of sales of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) in 2019 and 
continued prepayments, as well as higher unreimbursed servicing 
costs due to the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
such as extended foreclosure timelines and higher defaults. In 
addition to servicing fees, net servicing income includes 
amortization of commercial MSRs, changes in the fair value of 
residential MSRs, as well as changes in the fair value of derivatives 
(economic hedges) used to hedge the residential MSRs. The total 
fair value of our residential MSRs declined in first quarter 2020, 
compared with the same period a year ago, driven by lower 
mortgage interest rates and higher prepayments, which were 
substantially offset by hedge gains. In addition, the fair value 
decline in first quarter 2020 included assumption updates 
attributable to higher prepayment estimates. Table 2a presents 
the components of the market-related valuation changes to our 
residential MSRs, net of hedge results.

Our portfolio of loans serviced for others was $1.6 trillion at 

both March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019. At March 31, 
2020, the ratio of combined residential and commercial MSRs to 
related loans serviced for others was 0.60%, compared with 0.79% 
at December 31, 2019. See the “Risk Management – Asset/

Predominantly includes the results of Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) 
loss mitigation activities, interest rate management activities and changes in estimate to 
the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses. 

The production margin was 1.08% for first quarter 2020, 
compared with 1.05% for the same period a year ago. The increase 
in production margin in first quarter 2020, compared with the 
same period a year ago, was due to higher margins in both our 
retail and correspondent production channel, as well as a shift to 
more retail origination volume, which has a higher margin. The 
higher production margin was reduced by valuation losses on 
residential mortgage loans held for sale, particularly non-agency 
loans. 

Mortgage applications increased to $108 billion in first 
quarter 2020, compared with $64 billion for the same period a 
year ago. The 1-4 family first mortgage unclosed application 
pipeline was $62 billion at March 31, 2020, compared with 
$32 billion at March 31, 2019. For additional information about 
our mortgage banking activities and results, see the “Risk 
Management – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking 
Interest Rate and Market Risk” section and Note 11 (Mortgage 
Banking Activities) and Note 16 (Fair Values of Assets and 
Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Net gains from trading activities, which reflect unrealized 
changes in fair value of our trading positions and realized gains 
and losses, decreased to $64 million in first quarter 2020, 
compared with $357 million in the same period a year ago. The 
decrease in first quarter 2020, compared with the same period a 
year ago, reflected trading volatility created by the COVID-19 
pandemic. We had lower income in first quarter 2020 from wider 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Earnings Performance (continued) 

credit spreads for asset-backed securities and credit trading, as 
well as lower trading volumes on asset-backed securities, partially 
offset by increased demand for interest rate products due to 
lower interest rates. Net gains from trading activities exclude 
interest and dividend income and expense on trading securities, 
which are reported within interest income from debt and equity 
securities and other interest income. For additional information 
about trading activities, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ 
Liability Management – Market Risk-Trading Activities” section 
and Note 4 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Net losses from equity securities were $1.4 billion in first 

quarter 2020 and included $621 million of deferred 
compensation plan investment losses (largely offset in employee 
benefits expense). Net losses from equity securities in first 
quarter 2020 also included nonmarketable equity securities 
impairments of $935 million, reflecting lower market valuations. 
The impairments on equity securities in the venture capital, 
private equity and certain wholesale businesses represented 17% 
of the carrying values of these businesses’ portfolio investments 
subject to the impairment assessment. Table 3a presents results 
for our deferred compensation plan and related investments. 

Lease income decreased to $352 million in first quarter 
2020, compared with $443 million for the same period a year ago, 
driven by reductions in the size of the equipment leasing 
portfolio. 

All other income decreased to $211 million in first quarter 
2020, compared with $415 million for the same period a year ago. 
All other income includes income or losses from equity method 
investments, including low-income housing tax credit 
investments (excluding related tax credits recorded in income tax 
expense), foreign currency adjustments and related hedges of 
foreign currency risks, and certain economic hedges. The decrease 
in all other income was driven by higher income in first quarter 
2019 from gains on the sales of purchased credit-impaired (PCI) 
loans and a pre-tax gain on the sale of our Business Payroll 
Services business, partially offset by transition services fees in 
first quarter 2020 associated with the sale of our IRT business 
and gains on the sales of loans reclassified to held for sale in 2019 
and sold in first quarter 2020.

Represents expenses for assets we lease to customers. 

Noninterest expense was $13.0 billion in first quarter 2020, down 
6% from $13.9 billion in the same period a year ago, driven by 
lower personnel expenses, advertising and promotions expense, 
travel and entertainment expense, and other expense, partially 
offset by higher operating losses, and outside professional and 
contract services expense. 

Personnel expenses, which include salaries, commissions, 

incentive compensation, and employee benefits, were down 
$894 million, or 10%, in first quarter 2020, compared with the 
same period a year ago, due to lower employee benefits expense 
from lower deferred compensation expense (largely offset in net 
losses from equity securities) and lower incentive compensation 
and commissions, partially offset by higher salaries driven by the 
impact of staffing mix changes and annual salary increases, as 
well as one additional payroll day in the quarter. Table 3a 
presents results for our deferred compensation plan and related 
investments.

Represents change in deferred compensation plan liability. 

The decrease in incentive compensation and commissions 

was due to lower stock incentive compensation expense and 
lower annual bonus expense, partially offset by higher revenue-
related incentive compensation. We have provided various types 
of financial support to our employees in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, including additional cash payments for our 
employees who continue to serve customers, enhanced childcare, 
and other extended benefits. These additional benefits did not 
meaningfully impact our expenses in first quarter 2020, but are 
expected to have a greater impact beginning in second quarter 
2020 and throughout the remainder of the year. See the 
“Financial Review – Overview” section in this Report for more 
information on the actions we have taken to support our 
employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.

same period a year ago, largely due to an increase in project 
spending, partially offset by lower legal expenses. 

Advertising and promotion expense was down $56 million, 
or 24%, in first quarter 2020, compared with the same period a 
year ago, due to decreases in marketing and brand campaign 
volumes. 

Travel and entertainment was down $54 million, or 37%, in 
first quarter 2020, compared with the same period a year ago, 
driven by a reduction in business travel and company events due 
to ongoing expense management initiatives, as well as the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

All other expense was down $130 million, or 24%, in first 
quarter 2020, compared with the same period a year ago, due to 
higher gains on the extinguishment of debt, lower pension benefit 
plan expenses, and a lower insurance claims reserve. 

Income Tax Expense 
Income tax expense was $159 million in first quarter 2020, down 
82% from $881 million in the same period a year ago, driven by 
lower income. Our effective income tax rate was 19.5% for first 
quarter 2020, compared with 13.1% for the same period a year 
ago. The effective income tax rate for first quarter 2020 reflected 
net discrete income tax expense of $141 million driven by the 
accounting for stock compensation activity, the net impact of 
accounting for uncertain tax positions, and the outcome of U.S. 
federal income tax examinations. The lower rate in first quarter 
2019 was related to net discrete income tax benefits of 
$297 million related mostly to the results of U.S. federal and 
state income tax examinations and the accounting for stock 
compensation activity. 

Operating Segment Results 
As of March 31, 2020, we were organized for management 
reporting purposes into three operating segments: Community 
Banking; Wholesale Banking; and Wealth and Investment 
Management (WIM). These segments are defined by product 
type and customer segment and their results are based on our 
management reporting process. The management reporting 
process is based on U.S. GAAP with specific adjustments, such as 
for funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, for 
shared revenues and expenses, and tax-equivalent adjustments to 
consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt sources. 
On February 11, 2020, we announced a new organizational 
structure with five principal lines of business: Consumer and Small 
Business Banking; Consumer Lending; Commercial Banking; 
Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment 

Table 4:  Operating Segment Results – Highlights 

Management. This new organizational structure is intended to 
help drive operating, control, and business performance. The 
Company is currently in the process of transitioning to this new 
organizational structure, including identifying leadership for some 
of these principal business lines and aligning management 
reporting and allocation methodologies. These changes will not 
impact the consolidated financial results of the Company, but are 
expected to result in changes to our operating segments. We will 
update our operating segment disclosures, including comparative 
financial results, when the Company completes its transition and 
is managed in accordance with the new organizational structure. 
Table 4 and the following discussion present our results by 
operating segment. For additional description of our operating 
segments, including additional financial information and the 
underlying management reporting process, see Note 22 
(Operating Segments) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

We perform a goodwill impairment assessment annually in 

the fourth quarter. However, in first quarter 2020, we performed 
an interim, quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill 
given deteriorated macroeconomic conditions from the impact of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. These market conditions led to a sharp 
decline in share prices for Wells Fargo and other companies across 
many industries. As part of our interim assessment, we updated 
our assumptions used in both the income and market approaches 
for estimating fair values of our reporting units. The update to 
assumptions incorporated current market-based information 
such as price-earnings information and a regular update to our 
internal enterprise-wide forecasts, which reflected lower interest 
rates and higher expected credit losses, as well as a weaker 
macroeconomic outlook. While we observed declines in the fair 
values of our reporting units and the amount of excess fair value 
over the carrying amount of our reporting units, we did not have 
evidence of goodwill impairment. Due to the impact of the 
market disruption on our investment banking fees and trading 
activities, our corporate and investment banking reporting unit, 
included within the Wholesale Banking operating segment, had 
the smallest difference between fair value and carrying value. 
Given the uncertainty of the severity or length of the current 
economic downturn, we will continue to monitor market 
conditions for circumstances that could have a further negative 
effect on our estimated fair values on our reporting units. 

In connection with the planned change to our operating 
segment disclosures, we will realign our goodwill to the reporting 
units that underlie our operating segments. We will reassess 
goodwill for impairment at the time of the realignment.

Includes underwriting fees paid to Wells Fargo Securities for services related to the issuance of our corporate securities which are offset in our Wholesale Banking segment and eliminated in

Community Banking reported net income of $155 million in 
first quarter 2020, down $2.7 billion, or 95%, compared with the 
same period a year ago. 

Revenue of $9.5 billion in first quarter 2020, decreased 
$2.3 billion, or 19%, compared with the same period a year ago. 
The decrease in revenue was due to net losses on equity securities 
(including lower deferred compensation plan investment results, 
which were largely offset in employee benefits expense), lower 
card fees driven by higher rewards costs and the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic on consumer spending, lower net interest 
income reflecting the lower interest rate environment, and lower 
mortgage banking income. These decreases were partially offset 
by higher gains on debt securities and service charges on deposit 
accounts due to one additional day in first quarter 2020, and that 
first quarter 2019 included a higher level of fee waivers for 
customers affected by our data center system outage and the 
government shutdown. 

The provision for credit losses in first quarter 2020 increased 

$1.0 billion compared with the same period a year ago, 
predominantly due to a $1.0 billion increase in the allowance for 
credit losses in first quarter 2020 reflecting expected credit 
deterioration due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Noninterest expense of $7.1 billion in first quarter 2020, 
decreased $573 million, or 7%, compared with the same period a 
year ago, predominantly due to lower personnel expenses driven 
by lower deferred compensation expense (largely offset by net 
losses from equity securities) and lower other expenses, partially 
offset by higher operating losses driven by an increase in 
remediation accruals and higher outside professional services 
expense. 

Income tax expense of $644 million in first quarter 2020, 
increased $220 million from first quarter 2019, driven by a higher 
effective income tax rate of 19.5% and included net discrete 
income tax expense of $141 million driven by the accounting for

stock compensation activity, the net impact of accounting for 
uncertain tax positions, and the outcome of U.S. federal income 
tax examinations. 

Average loans of $462.6 billion in first quarter 2020, 
increased $4.4 billion, or 1%, compared with first quarter 2019. 
The increase in average loans from first quarter 2019 was due to 
higher real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans and automobile 
loans, partially offset by lower junior lien mortgage loans. 

Average deposits of $798.6 billion in first quarter 2020 
increased $33.0 billion, or 4%, from first quarter 2019 reflecting 
growth from retail banking deposit campaigns.

Income tax expense for our Wholesale Banking operating segment included income tax credits related to low-income housing and renewable energy investments of $491 million and $427 million for 
the first quarter 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Wholesale Banking reported net income of $311 million in 

first quarter 2020, down $2.5 billion, or 89%, from the same 
period a year ago. 

Net interest income of $4.1 billion in first quarter 2020 
decreased $398 million, or 9%, from first quarter 2019, due to the 
impact of the lower interest rate environment, partially offset by 
higher loan and deposit volumes and increased spreads on trading 
assets. 

investments and lower operating lease income, as well as lower 
other fees related to our sale of Eastdil in fourth quarter 2019. 
The provision for credit losses increased $2.2 billion from 
first quarter 2019, predominantly due to a $2.1 billion increase in 
the allowance for credit losses reflecting forecasted credit 
deterioration due to the COVID-19 pandemic and higher charge-
offs in the oil and gas portfolio driven by the significant decline in 
oil prices. 

Noninterest income decreased $896 million, or 35%, from 

Noninterest expense decreased $75 million, or 2%, from first 

first quarter 2019, predominantly due to lower market sensitive

Earnings Performance (continued) 

The following discussions provide additional information for 
client assets we oversee in our retail brokerage advisory and trust 
and investment management business lines. 

Retail Brokerage Client Assets  Brokerage advisory, commissions 
and other fees are received for providing full-service and discount 
brokerage services predominantly to retail brokerage clients. 
Offering advisory account relationships to our brokerage clients is 
an important component of our broader strategy of meeting 
their financial needs. Although a majority of our retail brokerage 
client assets are in accounts that earn brokerage commissions, 

the fees from those accounts generally represent transactional 
commissions based on the number and size of transactions 
executed at the client’s direction. Fees from advisory accounts are 
based on a percentage of the market value of the assets as of the 
beginning of the quarter, which vary across the account types 
based on the distinct services provided, and are affected by 
investment performance as well as asset inflows and outflows. A 
majority of our brokerage advisory, commissions and other fee 
income is earned from advisory accounts. Table 4d shows advisory 
account client assets as a percentage of total retail brokerage 
client assets at March 31, 2020 and 2019.

wealth businesses. Prior to the sale of our IRT business, which 
closed on July 1, 2019, we also earned fees from managing 
employee benefit trusts through the retirement business. Our 
asset management business is conducted by Wells Fargo Asset 
Management (WFAM), which offers Wells Fargo proprietary 
mutual funds and manages institutional separate accounts, and 

Table 4f:  WIM Trust and Investment – Assets Under Management 

our wealth business manages assets for high net worth clients. 
Substantially all of our trust and investment management fee 
income is earned from AUM where we have discretionary 
management authority over the investments and generate fees 
as a percentage of the market value of the AUM. For additional 
information on the sale of our IRT business, including its impact 
on our AUM and AUA, see the “Earnings Performance – 
Noninterest Income” section in this Report. Table 4f presents

Balance Sheet Analysis 

At March 31, 2020, our assets totaled $1.98 trillion, up 
$53.8 billion from December 31, 2019. Asset growth reflected 
increases in debt securities and loans of $4.4 billion and 
$47.6 billion, respectively, partially offset by a $15.7 billion 
decrease in federal funds sold and securities purchased under 
resale agreements, and a $14.2 billion decrease in equity 
securities. 

Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities

Represents amortized cost of the securities, net of the allowance for credit losses, of $161 million related to available-for-sale debt securities and $11 million related to held-to-maturity debt 
securities at March 31, 2020. The allowance for credit losses related to available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities was $0 at December 31, 2019, due to our adoption of CECL on January 
1, 2020. For more information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
Available-for-sale debt securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value, which includes the allowance for credit losses, subsequent to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. 
Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, subsequent to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. 

Table 5 presents a summary of our available-for-sale and 

held-to-maturity debt securities, which increased $3.7 billion in 
balance sheet carrying value from December 31, 2019, 
predominantly due to higher net unrealized gains. 

The total net unrealized gains on available-for-sale debt 
securities were $3.0 billion at March 31, 2020, down from net 
unrealized gains of $3.4 billion at December 31, 2019, driven by 
wider credit spreads, which were primarily offset by lower interest 
rates. For a discussion of our investment management objectives 
and practices, see the “Balance Sheet Analysis” section in our 
2019 Form 10-K. Also, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ 
Liability Management” section in this Report for information on 
our use of investments to manage liquidity and interest rate risk. 
After adoption of CECL, we recorded an allowance for credit 

losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt 
securities. Total provision for credit losses on debt securities was 
$172 million in first quarter 2020. For a discussion of our 
accounting policies relating to the allowance for credit losses on 
debt securities and underlying considerations and analysis, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 5 
(Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

At March 31, 2020, debt securities included $52.4 billion of 
municipal bonds, of which 97.2% were rated “A-” or better based 
predominantly on external ratings. Additionally, some of the debt 
securities in our total municipal bond portfolio are guaranteed 
against loss by bond insurers. These guaranteed bonds are 
predominantly investment grade and were generally 
underwritten in accordance with our own investment standards 
prior to the determination to purchase, without relying on the 
bond insurer’s guarantee in making the investment decision. The 
credit quality of our municipal bond holdings are monitored as 
part of our ongoing evaluation of the appropriateness of the 
allowance for credit losses on debt securities. 

The weighted-average expected maturity of debt securities 
available-for-sale was 4.2 years at March 31, 2020. The expected 
remaining maturity is shorter than the remaining contractual 
maturity for the 66% of this portfolio that is mortgage-backed 
securities (MBS) because borrowers generally have the right to 
prepay obligations before the underlying mortgages mature. The 
estimated effects of a 200 basis point increase or decrease in 
interest rates on the fair value and the expected remaining 
maturity of the MBS available-for-sale portfolio are shown in 
Table 6.

The weighted-average expected remaining maturity of debt 

securities held-to-maturity (HTM) was 4.5 years at March 31, 
2020. HTM debt securities are measured at amortized cost and, 
therefore, changes in the fair value of our held-to-maturity MBS 
resulting from changes in interest rates are not recognized in 
earnings. See Note 5 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity 
Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report for a 
summary of debt securities by security type.

Loan Portfolios 
Table 7 provides a summary of total outstanding loans by 
portfolio segment. Total loans increased $47.6 billion from 
December 31, 2019, due to an increase in commercial loans. 

Commercial loans increased $52.0 billion from December 31, 

2019, predominantly driven by growth in our commercial and 
industrial loan portfolio, reflecting significant draws on revolving 

lines of credit and additional funding requests within our 
Corporate & Investment Banking and Commercial Banking 
businesses due to the impact of COVID-19. 

Consumer loans were down $4.4 billion from December 31, 
2019, primarily due to a decrease in the credit card portfolio due 
to seasonality and fewer new accounts and lower consumer 
spending as a result of the impact of COVID-19.

Deposits were $1.4 trillion at March 31, 2020, up $53.9 billion 
from December 31, 2019, reflecting growth across all deposit 
gathering businesses driven by seasonality, customers’ flight to 
quality following the emergence of COVID-19, as well as the 
inflow of deposits associated with corporate and commercial loan 
draws. The increase in deposits was partially offset by actions 
taken to manage to the asset cap resulting in declines in other

hierarchy. 

Equity 
Total equity was $183.3 billion at March 31, 2020, compared with 
$188.0 billion at December 31, 2019. The decrease was 
predominantly driven by common stock repurchases of 
$3.4 billion, preferred stock redemptions of $2.5 billion, and 
dividends of $2.4 billion, partially offset by the issuance of 
preferred stock of $2.0 billion and net income of $653 million. 

Balance Sheet Analysis (continued) 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments 
to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value 
disclosures. See the “Critical Accounting Policies” section in our 
2019 Form 10-K and Note 16 (Fair Values of Assets and 
Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report for a description 
of our critical accounting policy related to fair value of financial 
instruments and a discussion of our fair value measurement 
techniques. 

Table 9 presents the summary of the fair value of financial 
instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, and the 
amounts measured using significant Level 3 inputs (before 
derivative netting adjustments). The fair value of the remaining 
assets and liabilities were measured using valuation 
methodologies involving market-based or market-derived 
information (collectively Level 1 and 2 measurements).

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial 
transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet, or may 
be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different 
from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. Our 
off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments to lend 
and purchase debt and equity securities, transactions with 
unconsolidated entities, guarantees, derivatives, and other 
commitments. These transactions are designed to (1) meet the 
financial needs of customers, (2) manage our credit, market or 
liquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify our funding sources. For 
additional information on our contractual obligations that may 
require future cash payments, see the “Off-Balance Sheet 
Arrangements – Contractual Cash Obligations” section in our 
2019 Form 10-K. 

Commitments to Lend 
We enter into commitments to lend to customers, which are 
usually at a stated interest rate, if funded, and for specific 
purposes and time periods. When we enter into commitments, we 
are exposed to credit risk. The maximum credit risk for these 
commitments will generally be lower than the contractual 
amount because a significant portion of these commitments are 
not funded. For more information, see Note 6 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Commitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities 
We enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale 
agreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ 
funding, liquidity or other future needs. For more information, see 
Note 13 (Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral, and Other 
Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities 
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability 
companies or partnerships that are established for a limited 
purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with 
securitization transactions and are considered variable interest 
entities (VIEs). For more information, see Note 10 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Guarantees and Other Arrangements 
Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby letters of credit, direct pay 
letters of credit, written options, recourse obligations, exchange 
and clearing house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types 
of similar arrangements. For more information, see Note 13 
(Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral, and Other 
Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Derivatives 
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to 
assist customers with their risk management objectives. 
Derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, and 
volume can be measured in terms of the notional amount, which 
is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which 
interest and other payments are determined. The notional 
amount is not recorded on the balance sheet and is not, when 
viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the 
instruments. For more information, see Note 15 (Derivatives) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

21 

 
Risk Management 

Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly affect 
our financial performance and our ability to meet the 
expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and 
other stakeholders. For more information about how we manage 
risk, see the “Risk Management” section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 
The discussion that follows supplements our discussion of the 
management of certain risks contained in the “Risk 
Management” section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Credit Risk Management 
We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a borrower 
or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in accordance 
with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many of our 
assets and exposures such as debt security holdings, certain 
derivatives, and loans. 

The Board’s Credit Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for credit risk. At the management level, Credit 
Risk, which is part of the Company’s Independent Risk 
Management (IRM) organization, has primary oversight 
responsibility for credit risk. Credit Risk reports to the Chief Risk 
Officer (CRO) and also provides periodic reports related to credit 
risk to the Board’s Credit Committee. 

Actions to Support Customers During the COVID-19 Pandemic 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have provided 
accommodations to our customers, including fee reversals for 
consumer and small business deposit customers, and fee waivers, 
payment deferrals, and other expanded assistance for mortgage, 
credit card, automobile, small business, personal and commercial 
lending customers. We have also provided significant credit to our 
customers. In March 2020, our commercial customers drew over 
$80 billion on revolving lines of credit. 

From March 9 through April 24, 2020, we helped more than 
1.7 million consumer, small business, and commercial customers 
by deferring payments, reversing and waiving fees, and offering 
maturity date extensions. We deferred approximately 1.4 million 
payments, representing more than $4.6 billion of principal and 
interest payments, of which approximately 50% related to real 
estate 1-4 family mortgage loans that we service for others. 
Additionally, we provided over 1.8 million fee waivers exceeding 
$75 million. For commercial distribution and automobile finance 
customers, we provided over 175,000 maturity date extensions, 
representing approximately $6.3 billion of outstanding principal 
and interest. The accommodations provided to our customers 
were not limited to customers that were past due. In addition, we 
do not plan on retaining fees from loans made in connection with 
the Paycheck Protection Program. 

On March 25, 2020, the U.S. Senate approved the 

Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES 
Act), a bill designed to provide a wide range of economic relief to 
consumers and businesses in the U.S. In addition, the CARES Act 
provides banks optional, temporary relief from accounting for 
certain loan modifications as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). 
The modifications must be related to the adverse effects of 
COVID-19 and certain other criteria are required to be met to 
apply the relief. In first quarter 2020, we elected to apply the TDR 
relief provided by the CARES Act, which expires no later than 
December 31, 2020. 

On April 7, 2020, federal banking regulators issued the 
Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for 
Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the 
Coronavirus (Revised) (the Interagency Statement). The 

22 

Interagency Statement provides additional TDR relief as it 
clarifies that it is not necessary to consider the impact of 
COVID-19 on the financial condition of a borrower in connection 
with short-term (e.g., six months) loan modifications related to 
COVID-19 provided the borrower is current at the date the 
modification program is implemented. For additional information 
regarding the TDR relief provided by the CARES Act and the 
clarifying TDR accounting guidance from the Interagency 
Statement, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report 

The TDR relief provided under the CARES Act, as well as from 

the Interagency Statement, does not change our processes for 
monitoring the credit quality of our loan portfolios or for 
updating our measurement of the allowance for credit losses for 
loans based on expected losses. 

Additionally, our election to apply the TDR relief provided by 

the CARES Act and the Interagency Statement impacts our 
regulatory capital ratios as these loan modifications related to 
COVID-19 are not adjusted to a higher risk-weighting normally 
required with TDR classification. 

Loan Portfolios 
The following discussion focuses on our loan portfolios, which 
represent the largest component of assets on our balance sheet 
for which we have credit risk. Table 10 presents our total loans 
outstanding by portfolio segment and class of financing

We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe 

are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while 
monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan 
portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and 
monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple 
risk factors affecting loans we hold, could acquire or originate 
including: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

Loan concentrations and related credit quality 
Counterparty credit risk 
Economic and market conditions 
Legislative or regulatory mandates 
Changes in interest rates 

  
 
•  Merger and acquisition activities 
• 

Reputation risk 

Our credit risk management oversight process is governed 

centrally, but provides for decentralized management and 
accountability by our lines of business. Our overall credit process 
includes comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit 
underwriting, frequent and detailed risk measurement and 
modeling, extensive credit training programs, and a continual loan 
review and audit process. 

A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-
controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate 
for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase 
the loans or securities collateralized by the loans. 

Credit Quality Overview  Credit quality in first quarter 2020 
declined due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on market 
conditions, which impacted our customer base. First quarter 2020 
results reflected: 
•  Nonaccrual loans were $6.2 billion at March 31, 2020, up 

from $5.3 billion at December 31, 2019, largely driven by a 
$585 million increase in commercial real estate and 
commercial and industrial nonaccrual loans, as the effect of 
the COVID-19 pandemic on market conditions began to 
impact our customer base. Commercial nonaccrual loans 
increased to $2.9 billion at March 31, 2020, compared with 
$2.3 billion at December 31, 2019, and consumer nonaccrual 
loans increased to $3.3 billion at March 31, 2020, compared 
with $3.1 billion at December 31, 2019. Nonaccrual loans 
represented 0.61% of total loans at March 31, 2020, 
compared with 0.56% at December 31, 2019. 

•  Net loan charge-offs (annualized) as a percentage of our 
average commercial and consumer loan portfolios were 
0.25% and 0.53% in first quarter 2020, respectively, 
compared with 0.11% and 0.51% in first quarter 2019. 
Loans that are not government insured/guaranteed and 
90 days or more past due and still accruing were $53 million 
and $828 million in our commercial and consumer portfolios, 
respectively, at March 31, 2020, compared with $78 million 
and $855 million at December 31, 2019.

•  Our provision for credit losses for loans was $3.8 billion in 

first quarter 2020, compared with $845 million for the same 
period a year ago. The increase in provision for credit losses 
for loans in first quarter 2020, compared with the same 
period a year ago, reflected an increase in the allowance for 
credit losses for loans due to forecasted credit deterioration 
from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and higher net 
loan charge-offs primarily due to the impact of the recent 
sharp decline in oil prices on our oil and gas portfolio. 
The allowance for credit losses for loans totaled $12.0 billion, 
or 1.19% of total loans, at March 31, 2020, up from 
$10.5 billion, or 1.09%, at December 31, 2019.

Additional information on our loan portfolios and our credit 

quality trends follows. 

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews  Measuring and monitoring 
our credit risk is an ongoing process that tracks delinquencies, 
collateral values, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, economic 
trends by geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain 
portfolios (typically commercial) and other indications of credit 
risk. Our credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable early 
identification of developing risk and to support our determination 
of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The following 
discussion provides additional characteristics and analysis of our 

significant portfolios. See Note 6 (Loans and Related Allowance 
for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for more 
analysis and credit metric information for each of the following 
portfolios. 

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING  For 
purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate 
commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according to 
market segmentation and standard industry codes. We generally 
subject commercial and industrial loans and lease financing to 
individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and 
collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to federal 
banking regulators’ definitions of pass and criticized categories 
with the criticized category including special mention, 
substandard, doubtful, and loss categories. 

The commercial and industrial loans and lease financing 

portfolio totaled $424.2 billion, or 42% of total loans, at 
March 31, 2020. The net charge-off rate (annualized) for this 
portfolio was 0.36% in first quarter 2020, compared with 0.16% 
for the same period a year ago. At March 31, 2020, and 
December 31, 2019, 0.45% and 0.44% of this portfolio was 
nonaccruing, respectively. Nonaccrual loans in this portfolio 
increased $270 million from December 31, 2019, due to the 
effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on market conditions, which 
impacted our customer base. Also, $20.5 billion of the 
commercial and industrial loan and lease financing portfolio was 
internally classified as criticized in accordance with regulatory 
guidance at March 31, 2020, compared with $16.6 billion at 
December 31, 2019, reflecting the effect of the COVID-19 
pandemic on market conditions, which impacted our customer 
base. 

The majority of our commercial and industrial loans and lease 

financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as 
accounts receivable, inventory and debt securities, as well as long-
lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. 
Generally, the collateral securing this portfolio represents a 
secondary source of repayment. 

Table 11 provides our commercial and industrial loans and 

lease financing by industry, and includes non-U.S. loans of 
$79.9 billion and $71.7 billion at March 31, 2020, and 
December 31, 2019, respectively. Significant industry 
concentrations of non-U.S. loans included $36.8 billion and 
$31.2 billion in the financials except banks category, and 
$20.2 billion and $19.9 billion in the banks category at March 31, 
2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. The oil, gas and 
pipelines category included $1.6 billion of non-U.S. loans at both 
March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019. The industry categories 
are based on the North American Industry Classification System. 

Loans to financials except banks, our largest industry 
concentration, were $126.3 billion, or 13% of total outstanding 
loans, at March 31, 2020, compared with $117.3 billion, or 12% of 
total outstanding loans, at December 31, 2019. This industry 
category is comprised of loans to investment firms, financial 
vehicles, and non-bank creditors, including those that invest in 
financial assets backed predominantly by commercial or 
residential real estate or consumer loan assets. We had 
$83.1 billion and $75.2 billion of loans originated by our Asset 
Backed Finance (ABF) lines of business at March 31, 2020, and 
December 31, 2019, respectively. These ABF loans are limited to a 
percentage of the value of the underlying financial assets 
considering underlying credit risk, asset duration, and ongoing 
performance. These ABF loans may also have other features to 
manage credit risk such as cross-collateralization, credit 
enhancements, and contractual re-margining of collateral 
supporting the loans. Loans to financials except banks included

collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) in loan form of $7.7 billion 
and $7.0 billion at March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, 
respectively. 

Oil, gas and pipelines loans totaled $14.3 billion, or 1% of 

total outstanding loans, at March 31, 2020, compared with 
$13.6 billion, or 1% of total outstanding loans, at December 31, 
2019. Oil, gas and pipelines loans included $9.5 billion and 
$9.2 billion of senior secured loans outstanding at March 31, 
2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Oil, gas and pipelines 
nonaccrual loans decreased to $549 million at March 31, 2020, 

compared with $615 million at December 31, 2019, due to higher 
net loan charge-offs, as well as loan payments, partially offset by 
new downgrades to nonaccrual status in first quarter 2020. 

In addition to the oil, gas and pipelines category, industries 
with escalated credit monitoring include retail, entertainment and 
recreation, transportation services, and commercial real estate. 
Table 11 and Table 12 include information about our exposure to 
certain sectors of these industries, including those that have been 
significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)  We generally subject CRE loans 
to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and 
collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to regulatory 
definitions of pass and criticized categories with criticized 
segmented among special mention, substandard, doubtful and 
loss categories. The CRE portfolio, which included $7.8 billion of 
non-U.S. CRE loans, totaled $143.6 billion, or 14% of total loans, 
at March 31, 2020, and consisted of $122.8 billion of mortgage 
loans and $20.8 billion of construction loans. 

Table 12 summarizes CRE loans by state and property type 

with the related nonaccrual totals. The portfolio is diversified 
both geographically and by property type. The largest geographic 
concentrations of CRE loans are in California, New York, Florida 

Table 12:  CRE Loans by State and Property Type 

and Texas, which combined represented 49% of the total CRE 
portfolio. By property type, the largest concentrations are office 
buildings at 26% and apartments at 18% of the portfolio. CRE 
nonaccrual loans totaled 0.67% of the CRE outstanding balance at 
March 31, 2020, compared with 0.43% at December 31, 2019. 
The increase in CRE nonaccrual loans reflected the effect of the 
COVID-19 pandemic on market conditions, which impacted our 
customer base. At March 31, 2020, we had $4.1 billion of 
criticized CRE mortgage loans, compared with $3.8 billion at 
December 31, 2019, and $222 million of criticized CRE 
construction loans, compared with $187 million at December 31, 
2019.

Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) 

NON-U.S LOANS  Our classification of non-U.S. loans is based on 
whether the borrower’s primary address is outside of the United 
States. At March 31, 2020, non-U.S. loans totaled $88.0 billion, 
representing approximately 9% of our total consolidated loans 
outstanding, compared with $80.5 billion, or approximately 8% of 
total consolidated loans outstanding, at December 31, 2019. 
Non-U.S. loans were approximately 4% of our consolidated total 
assets at both March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019. 

COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE  Our country risk monitoring process 
incorporates centralized monitoring of economic, political, social, 
legal, and transfer risks in countries where we do or plan to do 
business, along with frequent dialogue with our customers, 
counterparties and regulatory agencies. We establish exposure 
limits for each country through a centralized oversight process 
based on customer needs, and through consideration of the 
relevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures 
closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing 
conditions. 

We evaluate our individual country risk exposure based on 
our assessment of the borrower’s ability to repay, which gives 
consideration for allowable transfers of risk such as guarantees 
and collateral and may be different from the reporting based on 
the borrower’s primary address. Our largest single country 
exposure outside the U.S. based on our assessment of risk at 
March 31, 2020, was the United Kingdom, which totaled 
$37.6 billion, or approximately 2% of our total assets, and 
included $11.2 billion of sovereign claims. Our United Kingdom 
sovereign claims arise predominantly from deposits we have 
placed with the Bank of England pursuant to regulatory 
requirements in support of our London branch. 

The United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union 

(Brexit) on January 31, 2020, and is currently subject to a 

Table 13:  Select Country Exposures 

transition period during which the terms and conditions of its exit 
are being negotiated. As the United Kingdom exits from the 
European Union, our primary goal is to continue to serve our 
existing clients in the United Kingdom and the European Union as 
well as to continue to meet the needs of our domestic clients as 
they do business in those locations. We have an existing 
authorized bank in Ireland and an asset management entity in 
Luxembourg. Additionally, we established a broker dealer in 
France. We are in the process of leveraging these entities to 
continue to serve clients in the European Union and continue to 
take actions to update our business operations in the United 
Kingdom and European Union, including implementing new 
supplier contracts and staffing arrangements. For additional 
information on risks associated with Brexit, see the “Risk Factors” 
section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Table 13 provides information regarding our top 

20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) and our Eurozone 
exposure, based on our assessment of risk, which gives 
consideration to the country of any guarantors and/or underlying 
collateral. With respect to Table 13: 
• 

Lending exposure includes outstanding loans, unfunded 
credit commitments, and deposits with non-U.S. banks. 
These balances are presented prior to the deduction of 
allowance for credit losses or collateral received under the 
terms of the credit agreements, if any. 
Securities exposure represents debt and equity securities of 
non-U.S. issuers. Long and short positions are netted, and 
net short positions are reflected as negative exposure. 
•  Derivatives and other exposure represents foreign exchange 
contracts, derivative contracts, securities resale agreements, 
and securities lending agreements.

The real estate 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio includes 

some loans with an interest-only feature as part of the loan terms 
and some with adjustable-rate features. Interest-only loans were 
approximately 3% of total loans at both March 31, 2020, and 
December 31, 2019. We believe we have manageable adjustable-
rate mortgage (ARM) reset risk across our mortgage loan 
portfolios, including ARM loans that have negative amortizing 
features that were acquired in prior business combinations. We do 
not offer option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate 
mortgage products with fixed payment amounts, commonly 
referred to within the financial services industry as negative 
amortizing mortgage loans. In connection with our adoption of 
CECL on January 1, 2020, our real estate 1-4 family mortgage 
purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans, which had a carrying value 
of $568 million, were reclassified as purchased credit-
deteriorated (PCD) loans. PCD loans are generally accounted for 
in the same manner as non-PCD loans. For more information on 
PCD loans, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

We continue to modify real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans 
to assist homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulties. For more information on our modification programs, 
see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Real 
Estate 1-4 Family Mortgage Loans” section in our 2019 
Form 10-K. For more information on customer accommodations, 
including loan modifications, in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management 
– Actions to Support Customers During the COVID-19 Pandemic” 
section in this Report. 

Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, 
current FICO scores and loan/combined loan to collateral values 
(LTV/CLTV) on the entire real estate 1-4 family mortgage loan 
portfolio. These credit risk indicators on the mortgage portfolio 
exclude government insured/guaranteed loans. Loans 30 days or 
more delinquent at March 31, 2020, totaled $3.6 billion, or 1% of 
total mortgages, compared with $3.0 billion, or 1%, at 
December 31, 2019. Loans with FICO scores lower than 640 
totaled $7.5 billion, or 2% of total mortgages at March 31, 2020, 
compared with $7.6 billion, or 2%, at December 31, 2019. 
Mortgages with a LTV/CLTV greater than 100% totaled 
$2.5 billion at March 31, 2020, or 1% of total mortgages, 
compared with $2.5 billion, or 1%, at December 31, 2019. 
Information regarding credit quality indicators can be found in 
Note 6 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Real estate 1-4 mortgage loans by state are presented in 
Table 15. Our real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans to borrowers 
in California represented 13% of total loans at March 31, 
2020, located predominantly within the larger metropolitan 
areas, with no single California metropolitan area consisting of 
more than 4% of total loans. We monitor changes in real estate 
values and underlying economic or market conditions for all 
geographic areas of our real estate 1-4 family mortgage 
portfolios as part of our credit risk management process. Our 
underwriting and periodic review of loans and lines secured by 
residential real estate collateral includes original appraisals 
adjusted for the change in Home Price Index (HPI) or estimates 
from automated valuation models (AVMs) to support property 
values. Additional information about appraisals and AVMs and our 
policy for their use can be found in Note 6 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report and the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – 
Real Estate 1-4 Family Mortgage Loans” section in our 2019

Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) 

First Lien Mortgage Portfolio  Our total real estate 1-4 family 
first lien mortgage portfolio (first mortgage) decreased 
$927 million in first quarter 2020. Mortgage loan originations of 
$14.3 billion in first quarter 2020 were more than offset by 
paydowns. 

Net loan charge-offs (annualized) as a percentage of average 

first mortgage loans was 0.00% in first quarter 2020, compared 
with a net recovery of 0.02% for the same period a year ago. 
Nonaccrual loans were $2.4 billion at March 31, 2020, up 

$222 million from December 31, 2019. The increase in nonaccrual 
loans from December 31, 2019 was driven by the implementation 
of CECL, which required PCI loans to be classified as nonaccruing 
based on performance. For additional information, see the “Risk 
Management – Credit Risk Management – Nonperforming Assets 
(Nonaccrual Loans and Foreclosed Assets)” section in this Report.

Junior Lien Mortgage Portfolio  The junior lien mortgage 
portfolio consists of residential mortgage lines and loans that are 
subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. It is 
not unusual for these lines and loans to have draw periods, 
interest-only payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates, and 
similar features. Junior lien loan products are mostly amortizing 
payment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods 
between five to 30 years. 

We continuously monitor the credit performance of our 

junior lien mortgage portfolio for trends and factors that 
influence the frequency and severity of loss, such as junior lien 
mortgage performance when the first mortgage loan is 
delinquent. Table 17 shows certain delinquency and loss 
information for the junior lien mortgage portfolio and lists the 
top five states by outstanding balance. The decrease in 

outstanding balances since December 31, 2019, predominantly 
reflected loan paydowns. As of March 31, 2020, 4% of the 
outstanding balance of the junior lien mortgage portfolio was 
associated with loans that had a combined loan to value (CLTV) 
ratio in excess of 100%. Of those junior lien mortgages with a 
CLTV ratio in excess of 100%, 3% were 30 days or more past due. 
CLTV means the ratio of the total loan balance of first mortgages 
and junior lien mortgages (including unused line amounts for 
credit line products) to property collateral value. The unsecured 
portion (the outstanding amount that was in excess of the most 
recent property collateral value) of the outstanding balances of 
these loans totaled 1% of the junior lien mortgage portfolio at 
March 31, 2020. For additional information on consumer loans by 
LTV/CLTV, see Table 6.12 in Note 6 (Loans and Related Allowance 
for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) 

Our junior lien, as well as first lien, lines of credit portfolios 
generally have draw periods of 10, 15 or 20 years with variable 
interest rate and payment options available during the draw 
period of (1) interest only or (2) 1.5% of outstanding principal 
balance plus accrued interest. As of March 31, 2020, lines of 
credit in a draw period primarily used the interest-only option. 
During the draw period, the borrower has the option of 
converting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate 
to a fixed rate with terms including interest-only payments for a 
fixed period between three to seven years or a fully amortizing 
payment with a fixed period between five to 30 years. At the end 
of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an 
amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to 
30 years based on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines 
and loans have been structured with a balloon payment, which 
requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of 
the term period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully 
amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment 
increase, which can affect some borrowers’ ability to repay the 
outstanding balance. 

On a monthly basis, we monitor the payment characteristics 
of borrowers in our first and junior lien lines of credit portfolios. In 
March 2020, approximately 46% of these borrowers paid only the 
minimum amount due and approximately 50% paid more than the 
minimum amount due. The rest were either delinquent or paid 

less than the minimum amount due. For the borrowers with an 
interest-only payment feature, approximately 30% paid only the 
minimum amount due and approximately 66% paid more than the 
minimum amount due. 

The lines that enter their amortization period may 

experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the 
ones in their draw or term period. We have considered this 
increased inherent risk in our allowance for credit loss estimate. 

In anticipation of our borrowers reaching the end of their 
contractual commitment, we have created a program to inform, 
educate and help these borrowers transition from interest-only to 
fully-amortizing payments or full repayment. We monitor the 
performance of the borrowers moving through the program in an 
effort to refine our ongoing program strategy. 

Table 18 reflects the outstanding balance of our portfolio of 
junior lien mortgages, including lines and loans, and first lien lines 
segregated into scheduled end-of-draw or end-of-term periods 
and products that are currently amortizing, or in balloon 
repayment status. At March 31, 2020, $464 million, or 2%, of 
lines in their draw period were 30 days or more past due, 
compared with $395 million, or 5%, of amortizing lines of credit. 
Included in the amortizing amounts in Table 18 is $53 million of 
end-of-term balloon payments which were past due. The 
unfunded credit commitments for junior and first lien lines 
totaled $58.1 billion at March 31, 2020.

Substantially all lines and loans are scheduled to convert to amortizing loans by the end of 2029, with annual scheduled amounts through 2029 ranging from $1.8 billion to $4.6 billion and averaging 
$3.1 billion per year. 

CREDIT CARDS  Our credit card portfolio totaled $38.6 billion at 
March 31, 2020, which represented 4% of our total outstanding 
loans. The net charge-off rate (annualized) for our credit card 
portfolio was 3.81% for first quarter 2020, compared with 3.73% 
for first quarter 2019. 

AUTOMOBILE  Our automobile portfolio totaled $48.6 billion at 
March 31, 2020. The net charge-off rate (annualized) for our 
automobile portfolio was 0.68% for first quarter 2020, compared 
with 0.82% for first quarter 2019. The decrease in the net charge-
off rate in first quarter 2020, compared with the same period in 
2019, was driven by lower early losses on higher quality 
originations. 

OTHER REVOLVING CREDIT AND INSTALLMENT  Other revolving 
credit and installment loans, totaled $33.5 billion at March 31, 
2020, and largely included student and securities-based loans. 
Our private student loan portfolio totaled $10.6 billion at 
March 31, 2020. The net charge-off rate (annualized) for other 
revolving credit and installment loans was 1.59% for first quarter 
2020, compared with 1.47% for first quarter 2019.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED 
ASSETS)  Table 19 summarizes nonperforming assets (NPAs) for 
each of the last four quarters. Total NPAs increased $759 million 
from fourth quarter 2019 to $6.4 billion. Nonaccrual loans of 
$6.2 billion increased $810 million from fourth quarter 2019. 
Commercial nonaccrual loans increased predominantly due to an 
increase in commercial and industrial and real estate mortgage 
nonaccrual loans as a result of the economic slowdown due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic impacting our customers. Consumer 
nonaccrual loans increased driven by higher nonaccruals in the 
real estate 1-4 family mortgage portfolio, as our adoption of 
CECL required PCI loans to be classified as nonaccruing based on 
performance. Prior to January 1, 2020, PCI loans were excluded 
from nonaccrual loans because they continued to earn interest 
income from accretable yield, independent of performance in 
accordance with their contractual terms. However, as a result of 
our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, $275 million of real 
estate 1-4 family mortgage loans were reclassified from PCI to 
PCD loans, and as a result, were also classified as nonaccrual loans 
given their contractual delinquency. For more information on PCD 

Table 19:  Nonperforming Assets (Nonaccrual Loans and Foreclosed Assets) 

loans, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

For information about when we generally place loans on 

nonaccrual status, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2019 Form 
10-K. As part of our actions to support customers during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, we have provided borrowers relief in the 
form of loan modifications. Loan delinquency status will not 
change during any payment deferral period and loans that were 
accruing at the time the relief was provided generally will not be 
placed on nonaccrual status during the deferral period. For more 
information on customer accommodations, including loan 
modifications, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see the 
“Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Actions to 
Support Customers During the COVID-19 Pandemic” section in 
this Report.

Real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA are not placed on nonaccrual status because they are insured or guaranteed. 
Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate resulting from government insured/guaranteed loans are classified as nonperforming. Both principal and interest related to 
these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans were predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Receivables related to the foreclosure of certain government 
guaranteed residential real estate mortgage loans are excluded from this table and included in Accounts Receivable in Other Assets. For more information on foreclosed assets, see Note 1 (Summary 
of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2019 Form 10-K.

Total nonaccrual loans 

$ 

(1) 

In connection with our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, we classified $275 million of PCD loans as nonaccruing based on performance. 

• 

• 

• 

73% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on interest 
and 66% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on 
both principal and interest, but were on nonaccrual status 
because the full or timely collection of interest or principal 
had become uncertain. 
of the $1.4 billion of consumer loans in bankruptcy or 
discharged in bankruptcy, and classified as nonaccrual, 
$905 million were current. 
the remaining risk of loss of all nonaccrual loans has been 
considered and we believe is adequately covered by the 
allowance for loan losses. 

We continue to work with our customers experiencing 
financial difficulty to determine if they can qualify for a loan 
modification so that they can stay in their homes. Under our 
proprietary modification programs, customers may be required to 
provide updated documentation, and some programs require 
completion of payment during trial periods to demonstrate 
sustained performance before the loan can be removed from 
nonaccrual status. 

Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period 
represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status in 
accordance with our policy, offset by reductions for loans that are 
paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or are no longer classified 
as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and an 
improvement in the borrower’s financial condition and loan 
repayment capabilities. 

While nonaccrual loans are not free of loss content, we believe 
exposure to loss is significantly mitigated by the following factors 
at March 31, 2020: 
• 

94% of total commercial nonaccrual loans and 99% of total 
consumer nonaccrual loans are secured. Of the consumer 
nonaccrual loans, 96% are secured by real estate and 88% 
have a combined LTV (CLTV) ratio of 80% or less. 
losses of $573 million and $985 million have already been 
recognized on 11% of commercial nonaccrual loans and 34% 
of consumer nonaccrual loans, respectively, in accordance 
with our charge-off policies. Once we write down loans to the 
net realizable value (fair value of collateral less estimated 
costs to sell), we re-evaluate each loan regularly and record 
additional write-downs if needed.

Foreclosed government insured/guaranteed loans are temporarily transferred to and held by us as servicer, until reimbursement is received from FHA or VA. 
Includes loans moved into foreclosed assets from nonaccrual status and repossessed automobiles. 

Foreclosed assets at March 31, 2020, included $180 million 

of foreclosed residential real estate, of which 24% is 
predominantly FHA insured or VA guaranteed and expected to 
have minimal or no loss content. The remaining amount of 
foreclosed assets has been written down to estimated net 
realizable value. Of the $252 million in foreclosed assets at 
March 31, 2020, 71% have been in the foreclosed assets portfolio 
one year or less. 

As part of our actions to support customers during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, we have suspended certain mortgage 
foreclosure activities, which may affect the amount of our 
foreclosed assets for the remainder of the year. For additional 
information on loans in process of foreclosure, see Note 6 (Loans 
and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements 
in this Report.

For more information on our nonaccrual policies when a 
restructuring is involved, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)” section in 
our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Table 23 provides an analysis of the changes in TDRs. Loans 
modified more than once are reported as TDR inflows only in the 
period they are first modified. Other than resolutions such as 
foreclosures, sales and transfers to held for sale, we may remove 
loans held for investment from TDR classification, but only if they 
have been refinanced or restructured at market terms and qualify 
as new loans. 

Table 22 provides information regarding the recorded investment 
of loans modified in TDRs. The allowance for loan losses for TDRs 
was $439 million and $1.0 billion at March 31, 2020, and 
December 31, 2019, respectively. See Note 6 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report for additional information regarding TDRs. In those 
situations where principal is forgiven, the entire amount of such 
forgiveness is immediately charged off. When we delay the timing 
on the repayment of a portion of principal (principal forbearance), 
we charge off the amount of forbearance if that amount is not 
considered fully collectible. As part of our actions to support 
customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have provided 
borrowers relief in the form of loan modifications. Under the 
CARES Act and the Interagency Statement, loan modifications 
related to the COVID-19 pandemic will not be classified as TDRs 
if they meet certain eligibility criteria. For more information on 
the CARES Act and the Interagency Statement, see the “Risk 
Management – Credit Risk Management – Actions to Support 
Customers During the COVID-19 Pandemic” section in this 
Report.

Inflows include loans that modify, even if they resolve within the period, as well as gross advances on term loans that modified in a prior period and net advances on revolving TDRs that modified in a 
prior period. 

(2)  Other outflows consist of normal amortization/accretion of loan basis adjustments and loans transferred to held-for-sale. Occasionally, loans that have been refinanced or restructured at market

terms qualify as new loans, which are also included as other outflows. 
Net change in trial modifications includes: inflows of new TDRs entering the trial payment period, net of outflows for modifications that either (i) successfully perform and enter into a permanent 
modification, or (ii) did not successfully perform according to the terms of the trial period plan and are subsequently charged-off, foreclosed upon or otherwise resolved.

LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING  Loans 90 
days or more past due are still accruing if they are (1) well-
secured and in the process of collection or (2) real estate 1-4 
family mortgage loans or consumer loans exempt under 
regulatory rules from being classified as nonaccrual until later 
delinquency, usually 120 days past due. Prior to January 1, 2020, 
PCI loans were excluded from loans 90 days or more past due and 
still accruing because they continued to earn interest income 
from accretable yield, independent of performance in accordance 
with their contractual terms. In connection with our adoption of 
CECL, PCI loans were reclassified as PCD loans and classified as 
accruing or nonaccruing based on performance.

(1)  Quarterly net loan charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of average respective loans are annualized. 

Table 25 presents net loan charge-offs for first quarter 2020 and 
the previous four quarters. Net loan charge-offs in first quarter 
2020 were $909 million (0.38% of average total loans 
outstanding), compared with $695 million (0.30%) in first quarter 
2019. 

The increase in commercial and industrial net loan charge-
offs in first quarter 2020 was driven by higher losses in our oil and 
gas portfolio. The increase in consumer net loan charge-offs in 
first quarter 2020 was driven by higher losses in the credit card 
portfolio. 

The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact the credit 
quality of our loan portfolio, including resulting in additional net 
loan charge-offs. For more information on customer 
accommodations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see the 
“Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Actions to 
Support Customers During the COVID-19 Pandemic” section in 
this Report. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  We maintain an allowance for 
credit losses for loans, which is management’s estimate of the 
expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit 
commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and 
unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for 
sale. Additionally, we maintain an allowance for credit losses for 
debt securities classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-
maturity, other financial assets measured at amortized cost, net 
investments in leases, and other off-balance sheet credit 
exposures. 

We apply a disciplined process and methodology to establish 

our allowance for credit losses each quarter. The process for 
establishing the allowance for credit losses for loans takes into 
consideration many factors, including historical and forecasted 
loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and loan grade-
specific characteristics. The process involves subjective and 
complex judgments. In addition, we review a variety of credit 
metrics and trends. These credit metrics and trends, however, do 
not solely determine the amount of the allowance as we use 
several analytical tools. For additional information on our 
allowance for credit losses, see the “Critical Accounting Policies – 
Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. For additional information on our allowance for credit 
losses for loans, see Note 6 (Loans and Related Allowance for 
Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report, and for 
additional information on our allowance for credit losses for debt 
securities, see the “Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-For-Sale 
and Held-To-Maturity Debt Securities” section and Note 5

Disclosure is not comparative due to our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. For more information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
Total net loan charge-offs are annualized for quarter ended March 31, 2020. 

The ratio of the allowance for credit losses for loans to total 

nonaccrual loans may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, 
borrower credit strength and the value and marketability of 
collateral. 

The allowance for credit losses for loans increased 
$1.6 billion, or 15%, from December 31, 2019, driven by a 
$2.9 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses for loans in 
first quarter 2020, partially offset by a $1.3 billion decline as a 
result of adopting CECL. The increase in the allowance for credit 
losses for loans reflected forecasted credit deterioration due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic and credit weakness in the oil and gas 
portfolio due to the recent sharp declines in oil prices. Total 
provision for credit losses for loans was $3.8 billion in first quarter 
2020, compared with $845 million in first quarter 2019. The 
increase in the provision for credit losses for loans in first quarter 
2020, compared with the same period a year ago, reflected an 

increase in the allowance for credit losses for loans due to 
forecasted credit deterioration as a result of the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic and higher net loan charge-offs largely in 
the oil and gas portfolio due to the recent sharp declines in oil 
prices. 

In determining our allowance for credit losses for loans in 
first quarter 2020, our analysis considered multiple factors to 
evaluate the rapidly evolving impacts related to the COVID-19 
pandemic. We evaluated a range of expected losses based on 
economic forecasts that projected both a limited and a severe 
downturn in economic conditions. In addition, we reviewed 
several alternative forecasts that included relatively longer yet 
less severe downturns, as well as relatively shorter yet deeper 
downturns followed by a significant rebound near the end of 
2020. We also assessed the impact of the federal government’s 
recent economic stimulus programs coupled with expectations 
for customer accommodation activity of up to six months. Our 

38 

  
 
 
forecasted view reflected a sustained recession through 2020 
with a sustained increase in unemployment and decrease in gross 
domestic product (GDP) for the rest of the year. We also 
considered the estimated impact on certain industries that we 
expect to be directly and most adversely affected by the 
COVID-19 pandemic, as well as our exposure to the oil and gas 
industry and the potential for additional draws on commercial 
loan commitments. 

Future amounts of the allowance for credit losses for loans 

will be based on a variety of factors, including loan balance 
changes, portfolio credit quality and mix changes, and changes in 
general economic conditions and expectations (including for 
unemployment and GDP), among other factors. Based on 
economic conditions at the end of first quarter 2020, it was 
difficult to estimate the length and severity of the economic 
downturn that may result from the COVID-19 pandemic and the 
impact of other factors that may influence the level of eventual 
losses and corresponding requirements for future amounts of the 
allowance for credit losses, including the impact of economic 
stimulus programs and customer accommodation activity. The 
ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future 
developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be 
predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and 
actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the 
pandemic. The pandemic could continue to result in the 
recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in 
our allowance for credit losses, particularly if the impact on the 
economy worsens. 

We believe the allowance for credit losses for loans of 
$12.0 billion at March 31, 2020, was appropriate to cover 
expected credit losses, including unfunded credit commitments, 
at that date. The entire allowance is available to absorb expected 
credit losses from the total loan portfolio. The allowance for 
credit losses for loans is subject to change and reflects existing 
factors as of the date of determination, including economic or 
market conditions and ongoing internal and external examination 
processes. Due to the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses 
for loans to changes in the economic and business environment, it 
is possible that we will incur incremental credit losses not 
anticipated as of the balance sheet date. 

LIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE LOSSES  For 
information on our repurchase liability, see the “Risk 
Management – Credit Risk Management – Liability For Mortgage 
Loan Repurchase Losses” section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

RISKS RELATING TO SERVICING ACTIVITIES  In addition to servicing 
loans in our portfolio, we act as servicer and/or master servicer of 
residential mortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed mortgage 
securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of 
FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label 
mortgage securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans owned 
by institutional investors. In connection with our servicing 
activities, we could become subject to consent orders and 
settlement agreements with federal and state regulators for 
alleged servicing issues and practices. In general, these can 
require us to provide customers with loan modification relief, 
refinancing relief, and foreclosure prevention and assistance, as 
well as can impose certain monetary penalties on us. 

As a servicer, we are required to advance certain delinquent 

payments of principal and interest on the mortgage loans we 
service. Due to an increase in customer requests for payment 
deferrals as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect the 
amount of principal and interest advances we are required to 
make as a servicer to increase, which may adversely impact our 

net servicing income. The amount and timing of reimbursement 
of these advances varies by investor and the applicable servicing 
agreements in place. 

For additional information about the risks related to our 
servicing activities, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Risks Relating to Servicing Activities” section in 
our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Asset/Liability Management 
Asset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and 
managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. 
Primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides 
with the Finance Committee of our Board, which oversees the 
administration and effectiveness of financial risk management 
policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks. 
Primary oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the Risk 
Committee of the Board. At the management level we utilize a 
Corporate Asset/Liability Committee (Corporate ALCO), which 
consists of management from finance, risk and business groups, 
to oversee these risks and provide periodic reports to the Board’s 
Finance Committee and Risk Committee as appropriate. As 
discussed in more detail for market risk activities below, we 
employ separate management level oversight specific to market 
risk. 

INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk, which potentially can have 
a significant earnings impact, is an integral part of being a 
financial intermediary. We are subject to interest rate risk 
because: 
• 

assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times 
(for example, if assets reprice faster than liabilities and 
interest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially 
increase); 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by 
different amounts (for example, when the general level of 
interest rates is rising, we may increase rates paid on 
checking and savings deposit accounts by an amount that is 
less than the general rise in market interest rates); 
short-term and long-term market interest rates may change 
by different amounts (for example, the shape of the yield 
curve may affect new loan yields and funding costs 
differently); 
the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may 
shorten or lengthen as interest rates change (for example, if 
long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, MBS 
held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down slower 
than anticipated, which could impact portfolio income); or 
interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on loan 
demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage origination 
volume, the fair value of MSRs and other financial 
instruments, the value of the pension liability and other 
items affecting earnings. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

We assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under 

various net interest income simulations using many interest rate 
scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the 
degree of change over time, the speed of change and the 
projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require 
assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet 
composition such as loan originations, prepayment speeds on 
loans and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing 
strategies. 

Currently, our profile is such that we project net interest 

income will benefit modestly from higher interest rates as our 
assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our 

39 

 
 
Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

liabilities, while in the case of lower interest rates, our assets 
would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our 
liabilities. 

Our most recent simulations estimate net interest income 
sensitivity over the next two years under a range of both lower 
and higher interest rates. Measured impacts from standardized 
ramps (gradual changes) and shocks (instantaneous changes) are 
summarized in Table 27, indicating net interest income sensitivity 
relative to the Company’s base net interest income plan. Ramp 
scenarios assume interest rates move gradually in parallel across 
the yield curve relative to the base scenario in year one, and the 
full amount of the ramp is held as a constant differential to the 
base scenario in year two. The following describes the simulation 
assumptions for the scenarios presented in Table 27: 
• 

Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated growth 
across assets and liabilities. 

•  Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated with 

the changes in interest rates are held constant. 

•  Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary 

across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or 
lower interest rates. 

•  Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes 
consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit mix 
is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across the 
alternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, 
customer activity that shifts balances into higher-yielding 
products could reduce expected net interest income. 
•  We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities 

portfolios constant across scenarios.

The sensitivity results above do not capture interest rate 
sensitive noninterest income and expense impacts. Our interest 
rate sensitive noninterest income and expense are predominantly 
driven by mortgage banking activities, and may move in the 
opposite direction of our net interest income. Mortgage 
originations generally decline in response to higher interest rates 
and generally increase, particularly refinancing activity, in 
response to lower interest rates. Mortgage results are also 
impacted by the valuation of MSRs and related hedge positions. 
See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – 

40 

Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in this 
Report for more information. 

Interest rate sensitive noninterest income also results from 
changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits that 
reduce treasury management deposit service fees. Additionally, 
for the trading portfolio, our trading assets are (before the 
effects of certain economic hedges) generally less sensitive to 
changes in interest rates than the related funding liabilities. As a 
result, net interest income from the trading portfolio contracts 
and expands as interest rates rise and fall, respectively. The 
impact to net interest income does not include the fair value 
changes of trading securities and loans, which, along with the 
effects of related economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest 
income. 

We use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded 
and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to hedge 
our interest rate exposures. See the “Balance Sheet Analysis – 
Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities” section 
in this Report for more information on the use of the available-
for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios. The notional 
or contractual amount, credit risk amount and fair value of the 
derivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures as of 
March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, are presented in 
Note 15 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. We 
use derivatives for asset/liability management in two main ways: 
to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability 
• 
instruments/portfolios including investments, commercial 
loans and long-term debt, from fixed-rate payments to 
floating-rate payments, or vice versa; and 
to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, 
funded mortgage loans and MSRs using interest rate swaps, 
swaptions, futures, forwards and options. 

• 

MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK  We 
originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to 
various risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate risks. For 
more information on mortgage banking interest rate and market 
risk, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – 
Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in our 
2019 Form 10-K. 

While our hedging activities are designed to balance our 
mortgage banking interest rate risks, the financial instruments 
we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income 
being hedged. For example, the change in the value of ARM 
production held for sale from changes in mortgage interest rates 
may or may not be fully offset by index-based financial 
instruments used as economic hedges for such ARMs. Hedge 
results may also be impacted as the overall level of hedges 
changes as interest rates change, or as there are other changes in 
the market for mortgage forwards that may affect the implied 
carry on the MSRs. 

The total carrying value of our residential and commercial 

MSRs was $9.5 billion at March 31, 2020, and $12.9 billion at 
December 31, 2019. The weighted-average note rate on our 
portfolio of loans serviced for others was 4.20% at March 31, 
2020, and 4.25% at December 31, 2019. The carrying value of our 
total MSRs represented 0.60% and 0.79% of mortgage loans 
serviced for others at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, 
respectively. 

MARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss 
from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest 
rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and 
commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to 
counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, basis 

  
 
 
 
risk, and market liquidity risk. It also includes price risk in the 
trading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge 
effectiveness risk associated with the mortgage book, and 
impairment on private equity investments. 

The Board’s Finance Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for market risk and oversees the Company’s market 
risk exposure and market risk management strategies. In 
addition, the Board’s Risk Committee has certain oversight 
responsibilities with respect to market risk, including adjusting 
the Company’s market risk appetite with input from the Finance 
Committee. The Finance Committee also reports key market risk 
matters to the Risk Committee. 

At the management level, the Market and Counterparty Risk 

Management function, which is part of IRM, has primary 
oversight responsibility for market risk. The Market and 
Counterparty Risk Management function reports into the CRO 
and also provides periodic reports related to market risk to the 
Board’s Finance Committee. 

MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading 
activities to accommodate the investment and risk management 
activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to 
manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities 
predominantly occur within our Wholesale Banking businesses 
and to a lesser extent other divisions of the Company. Debt 
securities held for trading, equity securities held for trading, 
trading loans and trading derivatives are financial instruments 
used in our trading activities, and all are carried at fair value. 
Income earned on the financial instruments used in our trading 
activities include net interest income, changes in fair value and 
realized gains and losses. Net interest income earned from our 
trading activities is reflected in the interest income and interest 
expense components of our income statement. Changes in fair 

Table 28:  Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category 

value of the financial instruments used in our trading activities are 
reflected in net gains on trading activities, a component of 
noninterest income in our income statement. For more 
information on the financial instruments used in our trading 
activities and the income from these trading activities, see Note 4 
(Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to 
estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial 
markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with 
sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and 
monitoring market risk. For more information, including 
information regarding our monitoring activities, sensitivity 
analysis and stress testing, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ 
Liability Management – Market Risk – Trading Activities” section 
in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the 

market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The 
Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes 
to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. 
Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our 
balance sheet. 

Table 28 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk 

category. As presented in Table 28, average Company Trading 
General VaR was $33 million for the quarter ended March 31, 
2020, compared with $31 million for the quarter ended 
December 31, 2019, and $15 million for the quarter ended 
March 31, 2019. The increase in average as well as period end 
Company Trading General VaR for the quarter ended March 31, 
2020, compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2019, was 
driven by recent market volatility, in particular changes in interest 
rate curves and a significant widening of credit spreads entering 
the 12-month historical lookback window used to calculate VaR.

The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly 
correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may 
occur on different days. 

MARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES  We are directly and indirectly 
affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage 
direct investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth 
companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate 
recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that make 
similar private equity investments. These private equity 
investments are made within capital allocations approved by 
management and the Board. The Board’s policy is to review 
business developments, key risks and historical returns for the 
private equity investment portfolio at least annually. 
Management reviews these investments at least quarterly and 
assesses them for possible other-than-temporary impairment 

(OTTI) and observable price changes. For nonmarketable equity 
securities, the analysis is based on facts and circumstances of 
each individual investment and the expectations for that 
investment’s cash flows, capital needs, the viability of its business 
model, our exit strategy, and observable price changes that are 
similar to the investments held. Investments in nonmarketable 
equity securities include private equity investments accounted 
for under the equity method, fair value through net income, and 
the measurement alternative. 

In conjunction with the March 2008 initial public offering 

(IPO) of Visa, Inc. (Visa), we received approximately 20.7 million 
shares of Visa Class B common stock, the class which was

Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

apportioned to member banks of Visa at the time of the IPO. To 
manage our exposure to Visa and realize the value of the 
appreciated Visa shares, we incrementally sold these shares 
through a series of sales, thereby eliminating this position as of 
September 30, 2015. As part of these sales, we agreed to 
compensate the buyer for any additional contributions to a 
litigation settlement fund for the litigation matters associated 
with the Class B shares we sold. Our exposure to this retained 
litigation risk has been updated quarterly and is reflected on our 
balance sheet. For additional information about the associated 
litigation matters, see the “Interchange Litigation” section in 
Note 14 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
As part of our business to support our customers, we trade 

public equities, listed/OTC equity derivatives and convertible 
bonds. We have parameters that govern these activities. We also 
have marketable equity securities that include investments 
relating to our venture capital activities. We manage these 
marketable equity securities within capital risk limits approved by 
management and the Board and monitored by Corporate ALCO 
and the Market Risk Committee. The fair value changes in these 
marketable equity securities are recognized in net income. For 
more information, see Note 8 (Equity Securities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

our net income by (1) the value of third party assets under 
management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability 
to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock 
market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and 
other business activities. Each business line monitors and 
manages these indirect risks. 

LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING  The objective of effective liquidity 
management is to ensure that we can meet customer loan 
requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other 
cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating 
conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or 
market stress. To achieve this objective, the Board establishes 
liquidity guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to 
cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-
dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These 
guidelines are monitored on a monthly basis by the Corporate 
ALCO and on a quarterly basis by the Board. These guidelines are 
established and monitored for both the consolidated company 
and for the Parent on a stand-alone basis to ensure that the 
Parent is a source of strength for its regulated, deposit-taking 
banking subsidiaries. 

Liquidity Standards  We are subject to a rule, issued by the FRB, 
OCC and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), that 
includes a quantitative liquidity requirement consistent with the 
liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) established by the Basel Committee 
on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The rule requires banking 
institutions, such as Wells Fargo, to hold high-quality liquid assets 
(HQLA), such as central bank reserves and government and 
corporate debt that can be converted easily and quickly into cash, 
in an amount equal to or greater than its projected net cash 

outflows during a 30-day stress period. The rule is applicable to 
the Company on a consolidated basis and to our insured 
depository institutions (IDIs) with total assets greater than $10 
billion. In addition, rules issued by the FRB impose enhanced 
liquidity management standards on large bank holding companies 
(BHC) such as Wells Fargo. 

The FRB, OCC and FDIC have proposed a rule that would 
implement a stable funding requirement, the net stable funding 
ratio (NSFR), which would require large banking organizations, 
such as Wells Fargo, to maintain a sufficient amount of stable 
funding in relation to their assets, derivative exposures and 
commitments over a one-year horizon period. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio  As of March 31, 2020, the consolidated 
Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. were above the minimum 
LCR requirement of 100%, which is calculated as HQLA divided by 
projected net cash outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule. 
Table 29 presents the Company’s quarterly average values for the 
daily-calculated LCR and its components calculated pursuant to 
the LCR rule requirements.

Liquidity Sources  We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, cash 
equivalents and unencumbered high-quality, liquid debt 
securities. These assets make up our primary sources of liquidity 
which are presented in Table 30. Our primary sources of liquidity 
are substantially the same in composition as HQLA under the LCR 
rule; however, our primary sources of liquidity will generally 
exceed HQLA calculated under the LCR rule due to the applicable 
haircuts to HQLA and the exclusion of excess HQLA at our 
subsidiary IDIs required under the LCR rule. 

Our cash is predominantly on deposit with the Federal 
Reserve. Debt securities included as part of our primary sources 
of liquidity are comprised of U.S. Treasury and federal agency 
debt, and mortgage-backed securities issued by federal agencies 
within our debt securities portfolio. We believe these debt 
securities provide quick sources of liquidity through sales or by 
pledging to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions. 
Some of these debt securities are within our held-to-maturity 
portfolio and as such are not intended for sale, but may be 
pledged to obtain financing. Some of the legal entities within our 
consolidated group of companies are subject to various 
regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that can limit the 
transferability of their funds. We believe we maintain adequate 
liquidity for these entities in consideration of such funds transfer 
restrictions.

In addition to our primary sources of liquidity shown in

other debt securities including trading and/or available-for-sale 
debt securities, as well as through the sale, securitization or 
financing of loans, to the extent such debt securities and loans are 
not encumbered. As of March 31, 2020, we also maintained 
approximately $273.5 billion of available borrowing capacity at 
various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve 
Discount Window.

Long-Term Debt  We access domestic and international capital 
markets for long-term funding (generally greater than one year) 
through issuances of registered debt securities, private 
placements and asset-backed secured funding. We issue long-
term debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve 
cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity 
profile. Proceeds from securities issued were used for general 
corporate purposes, and, unless otherwise specified in the 
applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement, we expect the 
proceeds from securities issued in the future will be used for the 

same purposes. Long-term debt of $237.3 billion at March 31, 
2020, increased $9.2 billion from December 31, 2019. We issued 
$18.9 billion of long-term debt in first quarter 2020 and 
$11.8 billion in April and May 2020. Depending on market 
conditions, we may purchase our outstanding debt securities 
from time to time in privately negotiated or open market 
transactions, by tender offer, or otherwise. Table 32 provides the 
aggregate carrying value of long-term debt maturities (based on 
contractual payment dates) for the remainder of 2020 and the 
following years thereafter, as of March 31, 2020.

Credit Ratings  Investors in the long-term capital markets, as well 
as other market participants, generally will consider, among other 
factors, a company’s debt rating in making investment decisions. 
Rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and 
qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset 
quality, business mix, the level and quality of earnings, and rating 
agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent of 
federal financial assistance or support for certain large financial 
institutions. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a 
reduction of our credit rating; however, our debt securities do not 
contain credit rating covenants. 

There were no actions undertaken by the ratings agencies 
with regard to our credit ratings during first quarter 2020. On 
April 22, 2020, Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch) affirmed the Company’s 
long-term and short-term issuer default ratings and revised the 
rating outlook to negative from stable as Fitch expects significant 

operating environment headwinds from the disruption to 
economic activity and financial markets as a result of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. This rating action followed Fitch’s event-
driven review of the commercially-oriented U.S. G-SIBs. Both the 
Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. remain among the highest-
rated financial firms in the United States. 

See the “Risk Factors” section in our 2019 Form 10-K for 

additional information regarding our credit ratings and the 
potential impact a credit rating downgrade would have on our 
liquidity and operations, as well as Note 15 (Derivatives) to 
Financial Statements in this Report for information regarding 
additional collateral and funding obligations required for certain 
derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall 
below investment grade. 

The credit ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as 

of March 31, 2020, are presented in Table 33.

In addition, the Company is actively working with regulators, 

industry working groups (such as the ARRC) and trade 
associations that are developing guidance to facilitate an orderly 
transition away from the use of LIBOR. We are closely monitoring 
and seeking to follow the recommendations and guidance 
announced by such organizations, including those announced by 
the Bank of England’s Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free 
Reference Rates. We continue to assess the risks and related 
impacts associated with a transition away from IBORs. See the 
“Risk Factors” section in the 2019 Form 10-K for additional 
information regarding the potential impact of a benchmark rate, 
such as LIBOR, or other referenced financial metric being 
significantly changed, replaced, or discontinued. 

On March 12, 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (FASB) issued ASU 2020-04 – Facilitation of the Effects of 
Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (Update) that 
provides temporary relief from existing GAAP accounting 
requirements for entities that perform activities related to 
reference rate reform. The relief provided by the Update is 
primarily related to contract modifications and hedge accounting 
relationships that are impacted by the Company’s reference rate 
reform activities. For additional information on the Update, see 
the “Current Accounting Developments” section in this Report. 

For additional information on the amount of our IBOR-linked 

assets and liabilities, as well as the program structure and 
initiatives created by the LTO, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ 
Liability Management – LIBOR Transition” section in our 2019

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK MEMBERSHIP  The Federal Home Loan 
Banks (the FHLBs) are a group of cooperatives that lending 
institutions use to finance housing and economic development in 
local communities. We are a member of the FHLBs based in 
Dallas, Des Moines and San Francisco. Each member of the FHLBs 
is required to maintain a minimum investment in capital stock of 
the applicable FHLB. The board of directors of each FHLB can 
increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it 
has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to 
meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the 
minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges 
requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. 
Because the extent of any obligation to increase our investment 
in any of the FHLBs depends entirely upon the occurrence of a 
future event, potential future payments to the FHLBs are not 
determinable. 

LIBOR TRANSITION  Due to uncertainty surrounding the suitability 
and sustainability of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), 
central banks and global regulators have called for financial 
market participants to prepare for the discontinuation of LIBOR 
by the end of 2021. LIBOR is a widely-referenced benchmark rate, 
which is published in five currencies and a range of tenors, and 
seeks to estimate the cost at which banks can borrow on an 
unsecured basis from other banks. We have a significant number 
of assets and liabilities referenced to LIBOR and other interbank 
offered rates (IBORs), such as commercial loans, adjustable-rate 
mortgage loans, derivatives, debt securities, and long-term debt. 
Accordingly, we established a LIBOR Transition Office (LTO) 
in February 2018, with senior management and Board oversight. 
The LTO is responsible for developing a coordinated strategy to 
transition the IBOR-linked contracts and processes across Wells 
Fargo to alternative reference rates and serves as the primary 
conduit between Wells Fargo and relevant industry groups, such 
as the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC).

Capital Management 

We have an active program for managing capital through a 
comprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall 
capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an 
amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance 
objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market expectations. 
We primarily fund our working capital needs through the 
retention of earnings net of both dividends and share 
repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock 
and long and short-term debt. Retained earnings decreased 
$1.4 billion from December 31, 2019, predominantly as a result of 
common and preferred stock dividends of $2.5 billion, partially 
offset by $653 million of Wells Fargo net income. During first 
quarter 2020, we issued $1.7 billion of common stock, excluding 
conversions of preferred shares. During first quarter 2020, we 
repurchased $3.4 billion of common stock. The amount of our 
repurchases are subject to various factors as discussed in the 
“Securities Repurchases” section below. On March 15, 2020, we 
suspended our share repurchase activities for the remainder of 
the first quarter and for second quarter 2020. For additional 
information about share repurchases, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

In January 2020, we issued $2.0 billion of our Preferred 
Stock, Series Z. In March 2020, we redeemed the remaining 
$1.8 billion of our Preferred Stock, Series K, and redeemed 
$669 million of our Preferred Stock, Series T. For more 
information, see Note 17 (Preferred Stock) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Regulatory Capital Guidelines 
The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the 
FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital (RBC) guidelines establish a 
risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of 
assets and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. 

RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS  The Company is 
subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to 
implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking 
organizations. The federal banking regulators’ capital rules, 
among other things, required on a fully phased-in basis as of 
March 31, 2020: 
• 

a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 9.00%, 
comprised of a 4.50% minimum requirement plus a capital 
conservation buffer of 2.50% and for us, as a global 
systemically important bank (G-SIB), a capital surcharge of 
2.00%; 
a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 10.50%, comprised of a 
6.00% minimum requirement plus the capital conservation 
buffer of 2.50% and the G-SIB capital surcharge of 2.00%; 
a minimum total capital ratio of 12.50%, comprised of a 
8.00% minimum requirement plus the capital conservation 
buffer of 2.50% and the G-SIB capital surcharge of 2.00%; 
a potential countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% to be added 
to the minimum capital ratios, which could be imposed by 
regulators at their discretion if it is determined that a period 
of excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in 
systemic risk; and 
a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.00%. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

The Basel III capital requirements for calculating CET1 and 
tier 1 capital, along with risk-weighted assets (RWAs), are fully 
phased-in. However, the requirements for determining tier 2 and 
total capital are still in accordance with Transition Requirements 
and are scheduled to be fully phased-in by the end of 2021. The 
Basel III capital rules contain two frameworks for calculating 
capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced 
Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells 
Fargo. Accordingly, in the assessment of our capital adequacy, we 
must report the lower of our CET1, tier 1 and total capital ratios 
calculated under the Standardized Approach and under the 
Advanced Approach. 

Effective October 1, 2020, a stress capital buffer will be 
added to the minimum capital ratio requirements. The stress 
capital buffer will be calculated based on the decrease in a 
financial institution’s risk-based capital ratios under the 
supervisory severely adverse scenario in the annual 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four 
quarters of planned common stock dividends. The stress capital 
buffer will replace the current 2.50% capital conservation buffer 
under the Standardized Approach. Because the stress capital 
buffer will be calculated annually as part of CCAR and will be 
based on data that can differ over time, the amount of the 
buffer is subject to change in future years. 

As a G-SIB, we are also subject to the FRB’s rule 
implementing the additional capital surcharge of between 
1.00-4.50% on the minimum capital requirements of G-SIBs. 
Under the rule, we must annually calculate our surcharge under 
two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. The 
first method (method one) considers our size, 
interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, 
substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the 
methodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability 
Board (FSB). The second (method two) uses similar inputs, but 
replaces substitutability with use of short-term wholesale 
funding and will generally result in higher surcharges than the 
BCBS methodology. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is 
calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the 
amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. 

The tables that follow provide information about our risk-

based capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III 
capital guidelines. Although we continue to report certain capital 
amounts and ratios in accordance with Transition Requirements 
for banking industry regulatory reporting purposes, we are 
managing our capital based on a fully phased-in basis. For 
information about our capital requirements calculated in 
accordance with Transition Requirements, see Note 23 
(Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Table 34 summarizes our CET1, tier 1 capital, total capital, 

RWAs and capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis at

See Table 35 for information regarding the calculation and components of CET1, tier 1 capital, total capital and RWAs. 
Fully phased-in total capital amounts and ratios are considered non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management, bank regulatory agencies, investors and analysts to assess and monitor 
the Company’s capital position. See Table 35 for information regarding the calculation and components of our fully phased-in total capital amounts, including a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP 
financial measures. 
RWAs and capital ratios for December 31, 2019, have been revised as a result of a decrease in RWAs under the Advanced Approach due to the correction of duplicated operational loss amounts.

Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at 
period end. 
Under the Advanced Approach the allowance for credit losses that exceeds expected credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, to the extent the excess allowance does not exceed 0.60% of 
Advanced credit RWAs, and under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is includable in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of Standardized credit RWAs, with any excess allowance for 
credit losses being deducted from total RWAs. 
RWAs calculated under the Advanced Approach utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit models based upon our experience with internal rating grades. 
Advanced Approach also includes an operational risk component, which reflects the risk of operating loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems. 
Under the regulatory guidelines for risk-based capital, on-balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk 
categories according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with 
that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total RWAs. 
Amounts for December 31, 2019, have been revised as a result of a decrease in RWAs under the Advanced Approach due to the correction of duplicated operational loss amounts.

Capital Management (continued) 

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY  We also evaluate our business based 
on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible 
common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents 
total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, 
goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) 
and goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity 
securities, net of applicable deferred taxes. These tangible 
common equity ratios are as follows: 
• 

Tangible book value per common share, which represents 
tangible common equity divided by common shares 
outstanding; and 

• 

Return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE), which 
represents our annualized earnings contribution as a 
percentage of tangible common equity. 

The methodology of determining tangible common equity 
may differ among companies. Management believes that tangible 
book value per common share and return on average tangible 
common equity, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful 
financial measures because they enable investors and others to 
assess the Company’s use of equity. 

Table 38 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP 

financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO  As a BHC, we are required to 
maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of at least 5.00% 
(comprised of a 3.00% minimum requirement plus a 
supplementary leverage buffer of 2.00%) to avoid restrictions on 
capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our IDIs 
are required to maintain a SLR of at least 6.00% to be considered 
well-capitalized under applicable regulatory capital adequacy 
guidelines. In April 2018, the FRB and OCC proposed rules (the 
“Proposed SLR Rules”) that would replace the 2.00% 
supplementary leverage buffer with a buffer equal to one-half of 
our G-SIB capital surcharge. The Proposed SLR Rules would 
similarly tailor the current 6.00% SLR requirement for our IDIs. In 
April 2020, the FRB issued an interim final rule that temporarily 
allows a BHC to exclude on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. 
Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from 
the calculation of its total leverage exposure in the denominator 
of the SLR. The interim final rule became effective on April 1, 
2020, and expires on March 31, 2021. 

At March 31, 2020, our SLR for the Company was 6.84%, and 
we also exceeded the applicable SLR requirements for each of our 
IDIs. See Table 39 for information regarding the calculation and 
components of the SLR.

Adjustment represents derivatives and collateral netting exposures as defined for

Fargo & Company is the principal (i.e., principal counterparty facing the client). 
Adjustment represents credit equivalent amounts of other off-balance sheet exposures not 
already included as derivatives and repo-style transactions exposures. 

TOTAL LOSS ABSORBING CAPACITY As a G-SIB, we are required to 
have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt 
for purposes of resolvability and resiliency, often referred to as 
Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). U.S. G-SIBs are required to 
have a minimum TLAC amount (consisting of CET1 capital and 
additional tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or covered 
BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) equal to the greater of 
(i) 18.00% of RWAs and (ii) 7.50% of total leverage exposure (the 
denominator of the SLR calculation). Additionally, U.S. G-SIBs are 
required to maintain (i) a TLAC buffer equal to 2.50% of RWAs 
plus our applicable G-SIB capital surcharge calculated under 
method one plus any applicable countercyclical buffer to be added 
to the 18.00% minimum and (ii) an external TLAC leverage buffer 
equal to 2.00% of total leverage exposure to be added to the 
7.50% minimum, in order to avoid restrictions on capital 
distributions and discretionary bonus payments. U.S. G-SIBs are 
also required to have a minimum amount of eligible unsecured 
long-term debt equal to the greater of (i) 6.00% of RWAs plus our 
applicable G-SIB capital surcharge calculated under method two 

and (ii) 4.50% of the total leverage exposure. Under the Proposed 
SLR Rules, the 2.00% external TLAC leverage buffer would be 
replaced with a buffer equal to one-half of our applicable G-SIB 
capital surcharge, and the leverage component for calculating the 
minimum amount of eligible unsecured long-term debt would be 
modified from 4.50% of total leverage exposure to 2.50% of total 
leverage exposure plus one-half of our applicable G-SIB capital 
surcharge. As of March 31, 2020, our eligible external TLAC as a 
percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 23.27% compared 
with a required minimum of 22.00%. Similar to the risk-based 
capital requirements, we determine minimum required TLAC 
based on the greater of RWAs determined under the 
Standardized and Advanced approaches. 

OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS  As 
discussed in the “Risk Management – Asset/ Liability 
Management – Liquidity and Funding – Liquidity Standards” 
section in this Report, federal banking regulators have issued a 
final rule regarding the U.S. implementation of the Basel III LCR 
and a proposed rule regarding the NSFR. 

As a result of our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, our 
allowance for credit losses is now measured using an estimate of 
expected life-time credit losses methodology. Federal banking 
regulators issued rules permitting banking institutions whose 
capital levels decreased upon the adoption of CECL to phase in 
the adoption impact of CECL over a period of three years. 
Because we recognized a net reduction to our allowance for credit 
losses and a resulting increase to our capital levels upon the 
adoption of CECL, we were not eligible for this transition relief. In 
March 2020, federal banking regulators also issued rules that 
provide banking institutions an option to reduce any negative 
capital impact from the adoption of CECL and the difference 
between the allowance for credit losses under CECL and the 
previous incurred loss methodology. In first quarter 2020, we 
were not eligible for this transition relief. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing 
Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet 
regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-
term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow 
our business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying 
environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return 
capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital 
structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital 
requirements including the G-SIB capital surcharge. Accordingly, 
based on the final Basel III capital rules under the lower of the 
Standardized or Advanced Approaches CET1 capital ratios, we 
currently target a long-term CET1 capital ratio at or in excess of 
10.00%, which includes a 2.00% G-SIB capital surcharge. Our 
capital targets are subject to change based on various factors, 
including changes to the regulatory capital framework and 
expectations for large banks promulgated by bank regulatory 
agencies, planned capital actions, changes in our risk profile and 
other factors. As discussed above in the “Capital Management – 
Regulatory Capital Guidelines – Risk-Based Capital and Risk-
Weighted Assets” section of this Report, the FRB has issued a 
final rule that will replace the current 2.50% capital conservation 
buffer under the Standardized Approach with a stress capital 
buffer. Implementation of the stress capital buffer may cause our 
current long-term CET1 capital ratio target of 10.00% to 
increase. 

Under the FRB’s capital plan rule, large BHCs are required to 
submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the FRB 
has any objections before making any capital distributions. The 
rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material 

49 

  
  
At March 31, 2020, we had remaining Board authority to 

repurchase approximately 168 million shares, subject to 
regulatory and legal conditions. For more information about share 
repurchases during first quarter 2020, see Part II, Item 2 in this 
Report. 

Historically, our policy has been to repurchase shares under 

the “safe harbor” conditions of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 including a limitation on the daily volume 
of repurchases. Rule 10b-18 imposes an additional daily volume 
limitation on share repurchases during a pending merger or 
acquisition in which shares of our stock will constitute some or all 
of the consideration. Our management may determine that 
during a pending stock merger or acquisition when the safe 
harbor would otherwise be available, it is in our best interest to 
repurchase shares in excess of this additional daily volume 
limitation. In such cases, we intend to repurchase shares in 
compliance with the other conditions of the safe harbor, including 
the standing daily volume limitation that applies whether or not 
there is a pending stock merger or acquisition. 

Capital Management (continued) 

changes in a BHC’s risk profile, including as a result of any 
significant acquisitions. The FRB assesses, among other things, 
the overall financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of 
BHCs when evaluating capital plans. The capital plan rule also 
limits a large BHC’s ability to make capital distributions to the 
extent its actual capital issuances were less than amounts 
indicated in its capital plan. 

Our 2020 capital plan, which was submitted on April 3, 2020, 

as part of CCAR, included a comprehensive capital outlook 
supported by an assessment of expected sources and uses of 
capital over a given planning horizon under a range of expected 
and stress scenarios. As part of the 2020 CCAR, the FRB also 
generated a supervisory stress test, which assumed a sharp 
decline in the economy and significant decline in asset pricing 
using the information provided by the Company to estimate 
performance. The FRB is expected to review the supervisory 
stress test results both as required under the Dodd-Frank Act 
using a common set of capital actions for all large BHCs and by 
taking into account the Company’s proposed capital actions. The 
FRB has indicated that it will publish its supervisory stress test 
results as required under the Dodd-Frank Act, and the related 
CCAR results taking into account the Company’s proposed capital 
actions, by June 30, 2020. 

Concurrently with CCAR, federal banking regulators also 
require large BHCs and banks to conduct their own stress tests to 
evaluate whether the institution has sufficient capital to continue 
to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial 
conditions. These stress testing requirements set forth the 
timing and type of stress test activities large BHCs and banks 
must undertake as well as rules governing stress testing controls, 
oversight and disclosure requirements. 

Securities Repurchases 
From time to time the Board authorizes the Company to 
repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce 
when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not 
give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Future 
stock repurchases may be private or open-market repurchases, 
including block transactions, accelerated or delayed block 
transactions, forward repurchase transactions, and similar 
transactions. Additionally, we may enter into plans to purchase 
stock that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934. Various factors determine the amount of 
our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the 
number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans 
and acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of 
our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations, including the 
FRB’s response to our capital plan and to changes in our risk 
profile. Due to the various factors impacting the amount of our 
share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be in the market 
regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations under our capital 
plan, our share repurchases occur at various price levels. We may 
suspend share repurchase activity at any time. On March 15, 
2020, we, along with the other members of the Financial Services 
Forum, suspended our share repurchase activities for the 
remainder of the first quarter and for second quarter 2020. 

50 

In addition, the OCC and the FRB have issued guidelines for 
banks and BHCs related to working with customers affected by 
the COVID-19 pandemic, including guidance with respect to 
waiving fees, offering repayment accommodations, providing 
payment deferrals, and increasing daily withdrawal limits at 
automated teller machines. In addition, the federal government 
has instituted a moratorium on certain mortgage foreclosure 
activities. Any current or future rules, regulations, and guidance 
related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts could require 
us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue 
and earnings, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise 
adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive 
position. 

COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT (CRA) RATING  On May 4, 2020, 
we announced that we received an “Outstanding” rating from the 
OCC on our most recent CRA performance evaluation, which 
covers the years 2012 to 2018. 

Regulatory Matters 

Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, the U.S. 
financial services industry has been subject to a significant 
increase in regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This 
increased regulation and oversight has substantially changed how 
most U.S. financial services companies conduct business and has 
increased their regulatory compliance costs. 

For a discussion of certain consent orders applicable to the 
Company, see the “Overview” section in this Report. The following 
supplements our discussion of the other significant regulations 
and regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may 
affect our business contained in the “Regulatory Matters” and 
“Risk Factors” sections in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO COVID-19  In response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic and related events, federal banking 
regulators have undertaken a number of measures to help 
stabilize the banking sector, support the broader economy, and 
facilitate the ability of banking organizations like Wells Fargo to 
continue lending to consumers and businesses. For example, 
following the passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic 
Security Act (CARES Act) in March 2020, federal banking 
regulators issued interim final rules designed to encourage 
financial institutions to participate in stimulus measures, such as 
the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection 
Program and the FRB’s Main Street Lending Program. Similarly, 
the FRB launched a number of lending facilities designed to 
enhance liquidity and the functioning of markets, including 
facilities covering money market mutual funds and term asset-
backed securities loans. Federal banking regulators have also 
issued several joint interim final rules amending the regulatory 
capital and TLAC rules and other prudential regulations to ease 
certain restrictions on banking organizations and encourage the 
use of certain FRB-established facilities in order to further 
promote lending to consumers and businesses.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2019 Form 10-K) are fundamental to understanding our results 
of operations and financial condition because they require that 
we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of 
our assets or liabilities and financial results. Five of these 
policies are critical because they require management to make 
difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that 
are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially 
different amounts would be reported under different conditions 
or using different assumptions. These policies govern: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

the allowance for credit losses; 
the valuation of residential MSRs; 
the fair value of financial instruments; 
income taxes; and 
liability for contingent litigation losses. 

Management and the Board’s Audit Committee have 
reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies. These 
policies are described further in the “Financial Review – Critical 
Accounting Policies” section and Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2019 Form 10-K. In connection with our adoption of CECL on 
January 1, 2020, we have updated our critical accounting policy 
for the allowance for credit losses. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 
We maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans, 
which is management’s estimate of the expected credit losses in 
the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the 
balance sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit 
commitments carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, 
we maintain an allowance for credit losses for debt securities 
classified as either held-to-maturity (HTM) or available-for-sale 
(AFS), other financial assets measured at amortized cost, net 
investments in leases, and other off-balance sheet credit 
exposures. In connection with our adoption of CECL, we 
updated our approach for estimating expected credit losses, 
which includes new areas for management judgment, described 
more fully below, and updated our accounting policies. For more 
information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

For loans and HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured 

• 

based on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset 
(including off-balance sheet credit exposures) adjusted, as 
appropriate, for prepayments and permitted extension options 
using historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted 
information. For AFS debt securities, the ACL is measured using 
a discounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference 
between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost. 

Changes in the ACL and, therefore, in the related provision 

for credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying 
the judgment and review required to determine the ACL, 
management considerations include the evaluation of past 
events, historical experience, changes in economic forecasts and 
conditions, customer behavior, collateral values, and the length 
of the initial loss forecast period, and other influences. From 
time to time, changes in economic factors or assumptions, 
business strategy, products or product mix, or debt security 
investment strategy, may result in a corresponding increase or 
decrease in our ACL. While our methodology attributes portions 
of the ACL to specific financial asset classes (loan and debt 

52 

• 

security portfolios) or loan portfolio segments (commercial and 
consumer), the entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses of 
the company. 

• 

• 

Judgment is specifically applied in: 
Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss 
forecast period.  Forecasted economic variables, such as 
gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate or 
collateral asset prices, are used to estimate expected credit 
losses. While many of these economic variables are 
evaluated at the macro-economy level, some economic 
variables may be forecasted at more granular levels, for 
example, using the metro statistical area (MSA) level for 
unemployment rates, home prices and commercial real 
estate prices. Quarterly, we assess the length of the initial 
loss forecast period and have currently set the period to 
one year. 
Reversion of losses beyond the initial forecast period.  We use 
a reversion approach to connect the losses estimated for 
our initial loss forecast period to the period of our historical 
loss expectations. We give consideration to the type of 
portfolio, point in the credit cycle, expected length of 
recessions and recoveries, as well as other relevant factors. 
During forecasted periods of expansionary economic 
conditions, we revert immediately to our historical loss 
expectations. However, when recessionary conditions are 
forecasted over the initial loss forecast period, we will 
utilize a linear reversion to the long-term average losses. 
The length of reversion period varies by asset type – one 
year for shorter contractual term loans such as commercial 
loans and two years for longer contractual term loans such 
as 1-4 family mortgage loans. We assess the reversion 
approach on a quarterly basis and the length of the 
reversion period by asset type annually. 

•  Historical loss expectations.  At the end of the reversion 

period, we incorporate the changes in economic variables 
observed during representative historical time periods that 
include both recessions and expansions. This analysis is 
used to compute average losses for any given portfolio and 
its associated credit characteristics. Annually, we assess the 
historical time periods and ensure the average loss 
estimates are representative of our historical loss 
experience. 
Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans, 
unfunded credit commitments, and debt securities. 
Individually assessed credit risk ratings are considered key 
credit variables in our modeled approaches to help assess 
probability of default and loss given default. Borrower 
quality ratings are aligned to the borrower’s financial 
strength and contribute to forecasted probability of 
default curves. Collateral quality ratings combined with 
forecasted collateral prices (as applicable) contribute to the 
forecasted severity of loss in the event of default. These 
credit risk ratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit 
officers and subjected to reviews by an internal team of 
credit risk specialists. 
Usage of credit loss estimation models.  We use internally 
developed models that incorporate credit attributes and 
economic variables to generate estimates of credit losses. 
Management uses a combination of judgement and 
quantitative analytics in the determination of 
segmentation, modeling approach, and variables that are 
leveraged in the models. These models are validated in 

 
One hypothetical scenario represents an adverse scenario 
based on changes in economic variables experienced during the 
last credit crisis. Compared with the economic forecast used to 
develop our current ACL for loans, this adverse scenario reflects 
a more substantial and sustained increase in unemployment, a 
deeper and more sustained decline in GDP along with significant 
declines in consumer and commercial real estate prices. This 
adverse scenario resulted in an increase in the ACL for loans of 
$6.8 billion. 

A second more severe scenario is similar to our annual 
Company-run stress test. Compared with the adverse scenario, 
the more severe scenario reflects a sustained but sharper 
increase in unemployment and a more significant and sustained 
decline in GDP. Declines in real estate prices are consistent with 
the adverse scenario, with additional stress to consumer and 
commercial real estate prices based on our regional and 
industry concentrations, as well as an idiosyncratic stress as a 
result of declines in oil and gas prices. The more severe scenario 
resulted in an increase in the ACL for loans of $11.3 billion. 

The changes in economic variables in these scenarios were 
not contemplated in the economic forecast used to develop our 
current ACL for loans. In addition, these hypothetical increases 
in our ACL for loans represent changes to our quantitative 
estimate and do not incorporate the impact of management 
judgment for qualitative factors applied in the current ACL for 
loans, which may have an offsetting impact to the scenario 
results. Finally, if these hypothetical scenarios were to 
materialize, the increase in our ACL for loans may be recognized 
over time if actual loss expectations exceed our historical loss 
experience. 

These sensitivity analyses are hypothetical scenarios and 
the results do not represent management’s view of expected 
credit losses at the balance sheet date. The sensitivity analyses 
exclude the ACL for debt securities given its size relative to the 
overall ACL. Management believes that the current estimate for 
the ACL for loans was appropriate at the balance sheet date. 
Because significant judgment is used, it is possible that others 
performing similar analyses could reach different conclusions. 

accordance with the Company’s policies by an internal 
model validation group. We routinely assess our model 
performance and apply adjustments when necessary to 
improve the accuracy of loss estimation. We also assess our 
models for limitations against the company-wide risk 
inventory to help ensure that we appropriately capture 
known and emerging risks in our estimate of expected 
credit losses and apply overlays as needed. 
Valuation of collateral.  The current fair value of collateral is 
utilized to assess the expected credit losses when a 
financial asset is considered to be collateral dependent. We 
apply judgment when valuing the collateral either through 
appraisals, evaluation of the cash flows of the property, or 
other quantitative techniques. Decreases in collateral 
valuations support incremental charge-downs and 
increases in collateral valuation are included in the 
allowance for credit losses as a negative allowance when 
the financial asset has been previously written-down below 
current recovery value. 
Contractual term considerations.  The remaining contractual 
term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and 
certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. 
We extend the contractual term when we are not able to 
unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension 
options. We also incorporate into our allowance for credit 
losses any scenarios where we reasonably expect to provide 
an extension through a TDR. 

• 

• 

•  Qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in 
the loss models.  These amounts represent management’s 
judgment of risks inherent in the processes and 
assumptions used in establishing the ACL. We also consider 
economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions 
and performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, 
including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. 

Sensitivity  The ACL for loans is sensitive to changes in key 
assumptions which requires significant judgment to be used by 
management. Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based 
on a variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio 
credit quality, and general economic conditions. General 
economic conditions are forecasted using economic variables, 
which could have varying impacts on different financial assets or 
portfolios. Additionally, throughout numerous credit cycles, 
there are observed changes in economic variables such as the 
unemployment rate, GDP and real estate prices which may not 
move in a correlated manner as variables may move in opposite 
directions or differ across portfolios or geography. 

In order to provide a sensitivity analysis, we developed two 

hypothetical scenarios by applying changes in economic 
variables to our loan portfolio, which affect the expected 
balances, credit quality, and mix. The outcomes of both 
scenarios were influenced by the length of the scenario periods, 
as well as the duration and timing of changes in economic 
variables within those scenarios. The scenarios reflect the 
impact of economic stress and corresponding adverse changes 
in economic variables for a longer period than the initial loss 
forecast period used to develop our current ACL for loans. 
Neither of the scenarios consider any benefit related to 
economic stimulus programs or other legislative or regulatory 
relief.

Current Accounting Developments 

Table 41 provides the significant accounting updates applicable to 
us that have been issued by the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (FASB) but are not yet effective. 

Table 41:  Current Accounting Developments – Issued Standards 

Description 

Effective date and financial statement impact 

ASU 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): 
Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts and subsequent related updates 

The Update requires all features in long-duration insurance 
contracts that meet the definition of a market risk benefit to 
be measured at fair value through earnings with changes in 
fair value attributable to our own credit risk recognized in 
other comprehensive income. Currently, two measurement 
models exist for these features, fair value and insurance 
accrual. The Update requires the use of a standardized 
discount rate and routine updates for insurance assumptions 
used in valuing the liability for future policy benefits for 
traditional long-duration contracts. The Update also simplifies 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs. 

The guidance becomes effective on January 1, 2022. Certain of our variable annuity 
reinsurance products meet the definition of market risk benefits and will require the 
associated insurance related reserves for these products to be measured at fair value 
as of the earliest period presented, with the cumulative effect on fair value for 
changes attributable to our own credit risk recognized in the beginning balance of 
accumulated other comprehensive income. The cumulative effect of the difference 
between fair value and carrying value, excluding the effect of our own credit, will be 
recognized in the opening balance of retained earnings. As of March 31, 2020, we held 
$1.1 billion in insurance-related reserves of which $560 million was in scope of the 
Update. A total of $553 million was associated with products that meet the definition 
of market risk benefits, and of this amount, $65 million was measured at fair value 
under current accounting standards. The market risk benefits are largely indexed to 
U.S. equity and fixed income markets. Upon adoption, we may incur periodic earnings 
volatility from changes in the fair value of market risk benefits generally due to the 
long duration of these contracts. We plan to economically hedge this volatility, where 
feasible. The ultimate impact of these changes will depend on the composition of our 
market risk benefits portfolio at the date of adoption. Changes in the accounting for 
the liability of future policy benefits for traditional long-duration contracts and 
deferred acquisition costs will be applied to all outstanding long-duration contracts on 
the basis of their existing carrying amounts at the beginning of the earliest period 
presented, and are not expected to be material. 

ASU 2020-04 – Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) – Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting 

We adopted the guidance on April 1, 2020. We applied the guidance consistently to 
contractual amendments made to all applicable floating rate instruments indexed to 
IBORs. We elected to apply the guidance on an individual hedge-by-hedge basis for 
changes to hedge accounting relationships. The financial statement impact of the 
Update will change each period as contracts, existing and new, are impacted by 
reference rate reform activities and as our exposure changes to LIBOR and other 
IBORs. 

The Update provides temporary, optional relief to ease the 
potential burden of accounting for reference rate reform 
activities that affect contractual modifications of floating-
rate financial instruments indexed to IBORs and hedge 
accounting relationships. Contractual modifications and 
changes to existing hedge accounting relationships must 
meet specific requirements to qualify for the relief. Upon 
election the guidance is applied consistently to all applicable 
instruments, where a qualifying contractual modification is 
accounted for as the continuation of an existing contract 
rather than a new contract. The optional relief facilitates the 
preservation of existing fair value and cash flow hedge 
relationships while amending certain contractual terms of 
hedge accounting relationships, and changes the way the 
amounts excluded from the evaluation of hedge effectiveness 
are reported in earnings. Hedging relationships that qualify for 
the relief will not require discontinuation of the existing hedge 
accounting relationships. The election to apply the optional 
relief for existing fair value and cash flow hedge accounting 
relationships may be made on a hedge-by-hedge basis and 
across multiple reporting periods. 

The following Updates are applicable to us but are not 
expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial 
statements: 
• 

ASU 2020-01 – Investments – Equity Securities (Topic 321), 
Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 
323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Clarifying the 
Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815 (a 
consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force) 
ASU 2019-12 – Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the 
Accounting for Income Taxes

Forward-Looking Statements 

This document contains forward-looking statements. In addition, 
we may make forward-looking statements in our other 
documents filed or furnished with the SEC, and our management 
may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, 
investors, representatives of the media and others. Forward-
looking statements can be identified by words such as 
“anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” 
“expects,” “target,” “projects,” “outlook,” “forecast,” “will,” “may,” 
“could,” “should,” “can” and similar references to future periods. In 
particular, forward-looking statements include, but are not 
limited to, statements we make about: (i) the future operating or 
financial performance of the Company, including our outlook for 
future growth; (ii) our noninterest expense and efficiency ratio; 
(iii) future credit quality and performance, including our 
expectations regarding future loan losses and our allowance for 
credit losses; (iv) the appropriateness of the allowance for credit 
losses; (v) our expectations regarding net interest income and net 
interest margin; (vi) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of 
risk in our loan portfolios; (vii) future capital or liquidity levels, 
ratios or targets; (viii) the performance of our mortgage business 
and any related exposures; (ix) the expected outcome and impact 
of legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our 
expectations regarding compliance therewith; (x) future common 
stock dividends, common share repurchases and other uses of 
capital; (xi) our targeted range for return on assets, return on 
equity, and return on tangible common equity; (xii) expectations 
regarding our effective income tax rate; (xiii) the outcome of 
contingencies, such as legal proceedings; and (xiv) the Company’s 
plans, objectives and strategies. 

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts 
but instead represent our current expectations and assumptions 
regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. 
Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they 
are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in 
circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may 
differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-
looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against relying on 
any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither 
statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of 
future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of 
risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from 
those in the forward-looking statements include the following, 
without limitation: 
• 

current and future economic and market conditions, 
including the effects of declines in housing prices, high 
unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax 
matters, geopolitical matters, and any slowdown in global 
economic growth; 
the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on our credit 
quality and business operations, as well as its impact on 
general economic and financial market conditions; 
our capital and liquidity requirements (including under 
regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital 
standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or 
raise capital on favorable terms; 
financial services reform and other current, pending or future 
legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on 
our revenue and businesses, including the Dodd-Frank Act 
and other legislation and regulation relating to bank products 
and services;

developments in our mortgage banking business, including 
the extent of the success of our mortgage loan modification 
efforts, the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands 
that we receive, any negative effects relating to our 
mortgage servicing, loan modification or foreclosure 
practices, and the effects of regulatory or judicial 
requirements or guidance impacting our mortgage banking 
business and any changes in industry standards; 
our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as 
part of our expense management initiatives, including as a 
result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, 
changes in our business composition and operating 
environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, 
and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, 
litigation and regulatory matters; 
the effect of the current interest rate environment or 
changes in interest rates or in the level or composition of our 
assets or liabilities on our net interest income, net interest 
margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing 
rights and mortgage loans held for sale; 
significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or 
financial markets, which could result in, among other things, 
reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in 
the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and 
declines in asset values and/or recognition of impairments of 
securities held in our debt securities and equity securities 
portfolios; 
the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment 
banking business and our fee income from our brokerage, 
asset and wealth management businesses; 
negative effects from the retail banking sales practices 
matter and from other instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, including on our legal, 
operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in 
certain business activities or offer certain products or 
services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our ability 
to attract and retain qualified team members, and our 
reputation; 
resolution of regulatory matters, litigation, or other legal 
actions, which may result in, among other things, additional 
costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, 
reputational harm, or other adverse consequences; 
a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or 
infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or other 
service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks; 
the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings 
account deposits on our funding costs and net interest 
margin; 
fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; 
changes to U.S. tax guidance and regulations, as well as the 
effect of discrete items on our effective income tax rate; 
our ability to develop and execute effective business plans 
and strategies; and 
the other risk factors and uncertainties described under “Risk 
Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year 
ended December 31, 2019, as supplemented by the “Risk 
Factors” section in this Report. 

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the 
amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or 
repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and 
financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital 

55 

 
Forward-Looking Statements (continued) 

requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common 
stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations 
(including federal securities laws and federal banking regulations), 
and other factors deemed relevant by the Company’s Board of 
Directors, and may be subject to regulatory approval or 
conditions. 

For more information about factors that could cause actual 

results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our 
reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report 
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as 
supplemented by the “Risk Factors” section in this Report, as filed 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on its 
website at www.sec.gov. 

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of 

the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause 
our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it 
is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no 
obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, 
whether as a result of new information, future developments or 
otherwise, except as may be required by law. 

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  From time to 
time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP 
financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets 
for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to 
provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial 
measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial 
measures because we are unable to provide, without 
unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or 
estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the 
reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in 
forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may 
occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future 
results. 

56 

Moreover, the pandemic has created additional operational 

and compliance risks, including the need to quickly implement 
and execute new programs and procedures for the products and 
services we offer our customers, provide enhanced safety 
measures for our employees and customers, comply with rapidly 
changing regulatory requirements, address any increased risk of 
fraudulent activity, and protect the integrity and functionality of 
our systems and networks as a larger number of our employees 
work remotely. The pandemic could also result in downgrades to 
our credit ratings or credit outlook. In response to the pandemic, 
we have suspended residential property foreclosure sales, 
evictions, and involuntary automobile repossessions, and are 
offering fee waivers, payment deferrals, and other expanded 
assistance for credit card, automobile, mortgage, small business 
and personal lending customers, and future governmental actions 
may require these and other types of customer-related 
responses. In addition, we have temporarily suspended share 
repurchases and could take other capital actions in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which the COVID-19 
pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, and 
financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity 
ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly 
uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and 
duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental 
authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. 

Risk Factors 

An investment in the Company involves risk, including the 
possibility that the value of the investment could fall substantially 
and that dividends or other distributions on the investment could 
be reduced or eliminated. For a discussion of risk factors that 
could adversely affect our financial results and condition, and the 
value of, and return on, an investment in the Company, we refer 
you to the “Risk Factors” section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

The following risk factor supplements the “Risk Factors” 

section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business 
and financial results, and the ultimate impact will depend on 
future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be 
predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic 
and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to 
the pandemic.  The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted 
the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, lowered 
equity market valuations, created significant volatility and 
disruption in financial markets, and increased unemployment 
levels. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in temporary 
closures of many businesses and the institution of social 
distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states 
and communities. As a result, the demand for our products and 
services may be significantly impacted, which could adversely 
affect our revenue. Furthermore, the pandemic could continue to 
result in the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and 
increases in our allowance for credit losses, particularly if 
businesses remain closed, the impact on the global economy 
worsens, or more customers draw on their lines of credit or seek 
additional loans to help finance their businesses. Similarly, 
because of changing economic and market conditions affecting 
issuers, we may be required to recognize further impairments on 
the securities we hold as well as reductions in other

The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer participated in the evaluation. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s 
chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of 
March 31, 2020. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process 
designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s 
Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and 
includes those policies and procedures that: 

• 

• 

• 

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
assets of the Company; 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the Company; and 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the 
Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No change occurred during first quarter 
2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
