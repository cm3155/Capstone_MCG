Financial Review 

Overview 

Wells Fargo & Company is a diversified, community-based 
financial services company with $1.9 trillion in assets. Founded in 
1852 and headquartered in San Francisco, we provide banking, 
investment and mortgage products and services, as well as 
consumer and commercial finance, through 7,400 locations, 
more than 13,000 ATMs, digital (online, mobile and social), and 
contact centers (phone, email and correspondence), and we have 
offices in 32 countries and territories to support customers who 
conduct business in the global economy. With approximately 
260,000 active, full-time equivalent team members, we serve 
one in three households in the United States and ranked No. 29 
on Fortune’s 2019 rankings of America’s largest corporations. We 
ranked fourth in assets and third in the market value of our 
common stock among all U.S. banks at December 31, 2019. 

On February 11, 2020, we announced a new organizational 

structure with five principal lines of business: Consumer and 
Small Business Banking; Consumer Lending; Commercial 
Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and 
Investment Management. 

Wells Fargo’s top priority remains meeting its regulatory 
requirements in order to build the right foundation for all that 
lies ahead. To do that, the Company is committing the resources 
necessary to ensure that we operate with the strongest business 
practices and controls, maintain the highest level of integrity, and 
have in place the appropriate culture. 

Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding 
Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational 
Risk Management 
On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order 
with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of 
Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further 
enhance the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, 
and the Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further 
improve the Company’s compliance and operational risk 
management program. The Company continues to engage with 
the FRB as the Company works to address the consent order 
provisions. The consent order also requires the Company, 
following the FRB’s acceptance and approval of the plans and the 
Company’s adoption and implementation of the plans, to 
complete an initial third-party review of the enhancements and 
improvements provided for in the plans. Until this third-party 
review is complete and the plans are approved and implemented 
to the satisfaction of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated 
assets will be limited to the level as of December 31, 2017. 
Compliance with this asset cap will be measured on a two-
quarter daily average basis to allow for management of 

temporary fluctuations. As of the end of fourth quarter 2019, 
our total consolidated assets, as calculated pursuant to the 
requirements of the consent order, were below our level of total 
assets as of December 31, 2017. Additionally, after removal of 
the asset cap, a second third-party review must also be 
conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the 
enhancements and improvements. 

Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, 
Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and 
Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions 
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders 
with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an 
aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve 
matters regarding the Company’s compliance risk management 
program and past practices involving certain automobile 
collateral protection insurance policies and certain mortgage 
interest rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, 
the Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-
wide compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance 
the Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal 
consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In 
addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company 
submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers 
affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and 
mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the 
management of remediation activities conducted by the 
Company. 

Retail Sales Practices Matters 
In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, 
the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and 
entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, 
in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers 
received products and services they did not request. As a result, 
it remains a top priority to rebuild trust through a 
comprehensive action plan that includes making things right for 
our customers, team members, and other stakeholders, and 
building a better Company for the future. Our priority of 
rebuilding trust has included numerous actions focused on 
identifying potential financial harm to customers resulting from 
these matters and providing remediation. 

For additional information regarding retail sales practices 
matters, including related legal matters, see the “Risk Factors”

section and Note 17 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in 
this Report. 

Other Customer Remediation Activities 
Our priority of rebuilding trust has also included an effort to 
identify other areas or instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, 
and implement additional operational and control procedures. 
We are working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. We 
have previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of our 
rebuilding trust efforts and are in the process of providing 
remediation for those matters. We have accrued for the 
reasonably estimable remediation costs related to our rebuilding 
trust efforts, which amounts may change based on additional 
facts and information, as well as ongoing reviews and 
communications with our regulators. 

As our ongoing reviews continue, it is possible that in the 
future we may identify additional items or areas of potential 
concern. To the extent issues are identified, we will continue to 
assess any customer harm and provide remediation as 
appropriate. For more information, including related legal and 
regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” section and Note 17 (Legal 
Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Financial Performance 
In 2019, we generated $19.5 billion of net income and diluted 
earnings per common share (EPS) of $4.05, compared with 
$22.4 billion of net income and EPS of $4.28 for 2018. Financial 
performance items for 2019 (compared with 2018) included: 
• 

revenue of $85.1 billion, down from $86.4 billion, with net 
interest income of $47.2 billion, down $2.8 billion, or 6%, and 
noninterest income of $37.8 billion, up $1.4 billion, or 4%; 
the net interest margin was 2.73%, down 18 basis points; 
noninterest expense of $58.2 billion, up $2.1 billion, or 4%; 
an efficiency ratio of 68.4%, compared with 65.0%; 
average loans of $951.0 billion, up $5.8 billion; 
average deposits of $1.3 trillion, up $10.4 billion; 
our credit results remained strong with a net charge-off rate 
of 0.29%, flat compared with a year ago; 
nonaccrual loans of $5.3 billion, down $1.2 billion, or 18%; 
$30.2 billion in capital returned to our shareholders through 
common stock dividends and net share repurchases, up 17% 
from $25.8 billion a year ago; and 
return on assets (ROA) of 1.02% and return on equity (ROE) 
of 10.23%, down from 1.19% and 11.53%, respectively.

Table 1 presents a six-year summary of selected financial 
data and Table 2 presents selected ratios and per common share 
data. 

Balance Sheet and Liquidity 
Our balance sheet remained strong during 2019 with strong 
credit quality and solid levels of liquidity and capital. Our total 
assets were $1.9 trillion at December 31, 2019. Cash and other 
short-term investments decreased $10.1 billion from 
December 31, 2018, reflecting lower cash balances, partially 
offset by an increase in federal funds sold and securities 
purchased under resale agreements. Debt securities increased 
$12.4 billion from December 31, 2018, predominantly due to 
increases in trading and held-to-maturity debt securities. Loans 
increased $9.2 billion from December 31, 2018, driven by 
increases in commercial and industrial loans, commercial real 
estate mortgage loans, real estate 1-4 family first mortgage 
loans, automobile loans, credit card loans, and lease financing, 

partially offset by decreases in commercial real estate 
construction loans, real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage 
loans, and other revolving credit and installment loans. 

Average deposits in 2019 were $1.3 trillion, up $10.4 billion 

from 2018, reflecting higher other time deposits, mortgage 
escrow deposits and commercial deposits. Our average deposit 
cost in 2019 was 67 basis points, up 23 basis points from a year 
ago, driven by increased retail banking promotional pricing for 
new deposits and a continued deposit mix shift to higher cost 
products. 

Credit Quality 
Credit quality remained solid in 2019, as losses remained low and 
we continued to originate high-quality loans, reflecting our long-
term risk focus. Net charge-offs were $2.8 billion, or 0.29% of 
average loans, in 2019, flat compared with 2018. 

Our commercial portfolio net charge-offs were $652 million, 

or 13 basis points of average commercial loans, in 2019, 
compared with $429 million, or 9 basis points, in 2018, 
predominantly driven by increased losses in our commercial and 
industrial loan portfolio. Our consumer portfolio net charge-offs 
were $2.1 billion, or 48 basis points of average consumer loans, in 
2019, compared with $2.3 billion, or 52 basis points, in 2018, 
predominantly driven by decreased losses in our automobile 
portfolio, partially offset by increased losses in our credit card 
portfolio. 

The allowance for credit losses of $10.5 billion at 

December 31, 2019, decreased $251 million from the prior year. 
The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.09% at 
December 31, 2019, compared with 1.12% at December 31, 
2018. The allowance covered 3.8 times net charge-offs in 2019, 
compared with 3.9 in 2018. Future amounts of the allowance for 
credit losses will be based on a variety of factors, including loan 
growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions. 
Our provision for credit losses in 2019 was $2.7 billion, compared 
with $1.7 billion in 2018. The provision for credit losses in both 
2019 and 2018 reflected continuing solid underlying credit 
performance. The provision for credit losses in 2018 also 
reflected a higher level of credit quality improvement compared 
with 2019, as well as an improvement in the outlook associated 
with 2017 hurricane-related losses. 

Nonperforming assets (NPAs) at December 31, 2019, were 

$5.6 billion, down $1.3 billion from December 31, 2018. 
Nonaccrual loans decreased $1.2 billion from December 31, 
2018, driven by improvement across all consumer loan 
categories, including a decrease in consumer nonaccruals from 
sales of residential real estate mortgage loans as well as the 
reclassification of real estate 1-4 family mortgage nonaccrual 
loans to mortgage loans held for sale (MLHFS) in 2019. 
Foreclosed assets were down $148 million from December 31, 
2018. 

Capital 
Our financial performance in 2019 allowed us to maintain a solid 
capital position with total equity of $188.0 billion at 
December 31, 2019, compared with $197.1 billion at 
December 31, 2018. We returned $30.2 billion to shareholders in 
2019 ($25.8 billion in 2018) through common stock dividends 
and net share repurchases, and our net payout ratio (which is the 
ratio of (i) common stock dividends and share repurchases less 
issuances and stock compensation-related items, divided by (ii) 
net income applicable to common stock) was 168%. During 
2019, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend from 
$0.43 to $0.51 per share. We continued to reduce our common 
share count through the repurchase of 502.4 million common 

Wells Fargo & Company 

31 

Overview (continued) 

shares during the year. We expect our share count to continue to 
decline in 2020 as a result of anticipated net share repurchases. 
We believe an important measure of our capital strength is 
our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, which was 11.14% as of 
December 31, 2019, down from 11.74% a year ago, but still well 
above our internal target of 10%. Likewise, our other regulatory 
capital ratios remained strong. As of December 31, 2019, our 

Table 1:  Six-Year Summary of Selected Financial Data 

eligible external total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a 
percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 23.28%, compared 
with the required minimum of 22.0%. See the “Capital 
Management” section in this Report for more information 
regarding our capital, including the calculation of our regulatory 
capital amounts.

Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than 
mortgage servicing rights) and goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity securities, net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may 
differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity, which utilizes tangible common equity, is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and 
others to assess the Company’s use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures, see the 
“Capital Management – Tangible Common Equity” section in this Report. 
The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
See the “Capital Management” section and Note 29 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information. 
The risk-based capital ratios were calculated under the lower of the Standardized or Advanced Approach determined pursuant to Basel III. Beginning January 1, 2018, the requirements for calculating 
common equity tier 1 and tier 1 capital, along with risk-weighted assets, became fully phased-in. Accordingly, the information presented reflects fully phased-in common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 
capital and risk-weighted assets for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, but reflects all other ratios still in accordance with Transition Requirements. See the “Capital Management” 
section and Note 29 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information. 
Dividend payout ratio is dividends declared per common share as a percentage of diluted earnings per common share. 
Book value per common share is common stockholders’ equity divided by common shares outstanding.

Earnings Performance 

Wells Fargo net income for 2019 was $19.5 billion ($4.05 diluted 
EPS), compared with $22.4 billion ($4.28 diluted EPS) for 2018. 
Net income decreased in 2019, compared with 2018, due to a 
$2.8 billion decrease in net interest income, a $943 million 
increase in provision for credit losses, and a $2.1 billion increase 
in noninterest expense, partially offset by a $1.4 billion increase 
in noninterest income, and a $1.5 billion decrease in income tax 
expense. Net income in 2019 included a net discrete income tax 
expense of $435 million, compared with a net discrete income 
tax expense of $627 million in 2018. 

Revenue, the sum of net interest income and noninterest 
income, was $85.1 billion in 2019, compared with $86.4 billion in 
2018. Revenue decreased $1.3 billion in 2019, compared with 
2018, due to a decrease in net interest income, partially offset by 
an increase in noninterest income. Our diversified sources of 
revenue generated by our businesses continued to be balanced 
between net interest income and noninterest income. In 2019, 
net interest income of $47.2 billion represented 56% of revenue, 
compared with $50.0 billion (58%) in 2018. See later in this 
section for discussions of net interest income, noninterest 
income and noninterest expense. 

Table 3 presents the components of net interest income on 

a tax-equivalent basis, noninterest income and noninterest 
expense as a percentage of revenue for year-over-year results. 
Net interest income is presented on a taxable-equivalent basis to 
consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt loans 
and debt and equity securities based on a 21% federal statutory 
tax rate for the periods ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and 
35% for the period ended December 31, 2017. 

For a discussion of our 2018 financial results compared with 

2017, see the “Earnings Performance” section of our Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Net Interest Income 
Net interest income is the interest earned on debt securities, 
loans (including yield-related loan fees) and other interest-
earning assets minus the interest paid on deposits, short-term 
borrowings and long-term debt. The net interest margin is the 
average yield on earning assets minus the average interest rate 
paid for deposits and our other sources of funding. 

Net interest income and the net interest margin in any one 

period can be significantly affected by a variety of factors 
including the mix and overall size of our earning assets portfolio 
and the cost of funding those assets. In addition, variable sources 
of interest income, such as loan fees, periodic dividends, and 
collection of interest on nonaccrual loans, can fluctuate from 
period to period. 

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was 
$47.8 billion in 2019, compared with $50.7 billion in 2018. Net 
interest margin on a taxable-equivalent basis was 2.73% in 2019, 
compared with 2.91% in 2018. The decrease in both net interest 
income and net interest margin in 2019, compared with 2018, 
was driven by unfavorable impacts of repricing due to a 
flattening yield curve and mix of earning assets and funding 
sources, including sales of high yielding Pick-a-Pay loans, as well 
as higher costs on promotional retail banking deposits. 

Table 4 presents the components of earning assets and 
funding sources as a percentage of earning assets to provide a 
more meaningful analysis of year-over-year changes that 
influenced net interest income. 

Deposits are an important low-cost source of funding and 

affect both net interest income and the net interest margin. 
Deposits include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing 
checking, market rate and other savings, savings certificates, 
other time deposits, and deposits in non-U.S. offices. Average 
deposits were $1.3 trillion in 2019, flat compared with 2018, and 
represented 135% of average loans in both 2019 and 2018. 
Average deposits were 73% of average earning assets in both 
2019 and 2018. Our average deposit cost in 2019 was 67 basis 
points, up 23 basis points from a year ago, driven by increased 
retail banking promotional pricing for new deposits and a 
continued deposit mix shift to higher cost products. 

Table 5 presents the individual components of net interest 

income and the net interest margin. Net interest income and the 
net interest margin are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis 
in Table 5 to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-
exempt loans and debt and equity securities based on a 21% 
federal statutory tax rate for the periods ended December 31, 
2019 and 2018, and 35% for the period ended December 31, 
2017.

Yields/rates and amounts include the effects of hedge and risk management activities associated with the respective asset and liability categories. 
Yields/rates are based on interest income/expense amounts for the period. The average balance amounts represent amortized cost for the periods presented.

Table 6 allocates the changes in net interest income on a 
taxable-equivalent basis to changes in either average balances or 
average rates for both interest-earning assets and interest-
bearing liabilities. Because of the numerous simultaneous 
volume and rate changes during any period, it is not possible to 

precisely allocate such changes between volume and rate. For 
this table, changes that are not solely due to either volume or 
rate are allocated to these categories on a pro-rata basis based 
on the absolute value of the change due to average volume and 
average rate.

Noninterest income of $37.8 billion represented 44% of revenue 
for 2019, compared with $36.4 billion, or 42%, for 2018 and 
$38.8 billion, or 44%, for 2017. The increase in noninterest 
income in 2019, compared with 2018, was predominantly due to 
higher net gains from equity securities (including higher deferred 
compensation plan investment results, which are offset in 
employee benefits expense), higher all other income, and higher 
net gains from trading activities. These increases in 2019, 
compared with 2018, were partially offset by lower trust and 
investment fees, mortgage banking income, and other fees. The 
decline in noninterest income in 2018, compared with 2017, was 
predominantly due to lower net gains on mortgage loan 
origination/sales activities driven by decreased origination 
volumes and margins, lower insurance income due to the sale of 
Wells Fargo Insurance Services in fourth quarter 2017, lower 
service charges on deposit accounts, lower gains on debt 
securities, and lower deferred compensation plan investment 
results (offset in employee benefits expense). These decreases in 
2018, compared with 2017, were partially offset by higher gains 
from equity securities and higher all other income. For more 
information on our performance obligations and the nature of 
services performed for certain of our revenues discussed below, 
see Note 22 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Service charges on deposit accounts increased to $4.8 billion 

in 2019, compared with $4.7 billion in 2018, predominantly due 
to higher overdraft fees resulting from increased consumer 
payment transactions, partially offset by the impact of a higher 
earnings credit rate applied to commercial accounts due to 
higher interest rates. 

Brokerage advisory, commissions and other fees decreased 

to $9.2 billion in 2019, compared with $9.4 billion in 2018, due to 
lower asset-based fees and lower transactional revenue. Retail 

brokerage client assets totaled $1.6 trillion at December 31, 
2019, compared with $1.5 trillion at December 31, 2018. Asset-
based fees are calculated on the market value of the assets as of 
the beginning of each quarter. All retail brokerage services are 
provided by our WIM operating segment. For additional 
information on retail brokerage client assets, see the discussion 
and Tables 9d and 9e in the “Operating Segment Results – 
Wealth and Investment Management – Retail Brokerage Client 
Assets” section in this Report. 

Trust and investment management fees decreased to 
$3.0 billion in 2019, compared with $3.3 billion in 2018, largely 
driven by lower trust fees due to the sale of our Institutional 
Retirement and Trust (IRT) business in 2019. 

Our assets under management (AUM), including IRT client 

assets still on our platform, totaled $705.9 billion at 
December 31, 2019, compared with $638.3 billion at 
December 31, 2018. Substantially all of our AUM is managed by 
our Wealth and Investment Management (WIM) operating 
segment. Our assets under administration (AUA), including IRT 
client assets still on our platform, totaled $1.8 trillion at 
December 31, 2019, compared with $1.7 trillion at December 31, 
2018. We had AUM and AUA associated with the IRT business of 
$21 billion and $915 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019. 
No IRT client assets were transitioned to the buyer’s platform as 
of December 31, 2019. 

We closed the sale of our IRT business on July 1, 2019. We 
will continue to administer client assets at the direction of the 
buyer for up to 24 months from the closing date pursuant to a 
transition services agreement. The buyer will receive post-closing 
revenue from the client assets and will pay us a fee for certain 
costs that we incur to administer the client assets during the 
transition period. The transition services fee will be recognized as 
other noninterest income, and the expenses we incur will be 
recognized in the same manner as they were prior to the close of 
the sale. Transition period revenue is expected to approximate 
transition period expenses and is subject to downward 
adjustment as client assets transition to the buyer’s platform. 
Additional information regarding our WIM operating 
segment AUM is provided in Table 9f and the related discussion 
in the “Operating Segment Results – Wealth and Investment 
Management – Trust and Investment Client Assets Under 
Management” section in this Report. 

Other fees decreased to $3.1 billion in 2019 from 
$3.4 billion in 2018, predominantly driven by the sale of our 
commercial real estate brokerage business (Eastdil Secured 
(Eastdil)) on October 1, 2019 and lower lending related charges 
and fees. 

Mortgage banking income, consisting of net servicing 
income and net gains on loan origination/sales activities, totaled 
$2.7 billion in 2019, compared with $3.0 billion in 2018. For more 
information, see Note 11 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Net servicing income was $522 million in 2019, compared 
with $1.4 billion in 2018, due to a decrease in net servicing fees 
and changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights 
(MSRs). Net servicing fees decreased $369 million from 2018, 
primarily driven by a decrease in contractually specified fees as a 
result of prepayments and sales of MSRs. In addition to servicing 
fees, net servicing income includes amortization of commercial 
MSRs, changes in the fair value of residential MSRs, as well as 
changes in the fair value of derivatives (economic hedges) used 
to hedge the residential MSRs. The total fair value of our 
residential MSRs declined in 2019, compared with 2018, driven 
by lower mortgage interest rates and higher prepayments. The 
net MSR valuation loss on our residential MSRs increased in

2019, compared with 2018, due to a decrease in hedge carry 
income from a flatter yield curve environment in 2019. Table 7a

Our portfolio of loans serviced for others was $1.6 trillion at 

December 31, 2019, and $1.7 trillion at December 31, 2018. At 
December 31, 2019, the ratio of combined residential and 
commercial MSRs to related loans serviced for others was 0.79%, 
compared with 0.94% at December 31, 2018. See the “Risk 
Management – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking 
Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in this Report for 
additional information regarding our MSRs risks and hedging 
approach. 

Net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities was 

$2.2 billion in 2019, compared with $1.6 billion in 2018. The 
increase in 2019, compared with 2018, was primarily due to 
increases in origination volumes and margins. The production 
margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage loan originations, 
which represents net gains on residential mortgage loan 
origination/sales activities divided by total residential held-for-
sale mortgage loan originations, provides a measure of the 
profitability of our residential mortgage origination activity. 
Table 7b presents the information used in determining the 
production margin.

Primarily includes the results of Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) loss 
mitigation activities, interest rate management activities and changes in estimate to the 
liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses. 

The production margin was 1.12% for 2019, compared with 
0.89% for 2018. The increase in the production margin in 2019, 
compared with 2018, was due to higher margins in both retail 
and correspondent production channels and a shift to more retail 
origination volume, which has a higher production margin. 

Mortgage applications were $311 billion in 2019, compared 

with $230 billion in 2018. The real estate 1-4 family first 
mortgage unclosed pipeline was $33 billion at December 31, 
2019, compared with $18 billion at December 31, 2018. For 
additional information about our mortgage banking activities 
and results, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market 
Risk” section and Note 11 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and 
Note 19 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Net gains from trading activities, which reflect unrealized 
changes in fair value of our trading positions and realized gains 
and losses, were $993 million in 2019, compared with 
$602 million in 2018. The increase in 2019, compared with 2018, 
reflected higher trading volumes for rates and commodities, 
credit, and residential mortgage-backed securities, partially 
offset by lower equity and foreign exchange trading income. Net 
gains from trading activities exclude interest and dividend 
income and expense on trading securities, which are reported 
within interest income from debt and equity securities and other 
interest income. For additional information about trading 
activities, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management – Market Risk – Trading Activities” section and 
Note 4 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Net gains on debt and equity securities totaled $3.0 billion 

for 2019 and $1.6 billion for 2018. The increase in 2019 was 
predominantly driven by higher deferred compensation gains 
(offset in employee benefits expense) and higher unrealized 
gains on equity securities, partially offset by lower net realized 
gains from nonmarketable equity securities. Table 8a presents 
results for our deferred compensation plan and related 
investments. Net gains on debt and equity securities also 
included other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) write-downs 
of $308 million for 2019 and $380 million for 2018. The 
decrease in OTTI in 2019 reflected a $214 million impairment 
taken in 2018 related to the sale of our ownership stake in The 
Rock Creek Group, LP (RockCreek), partially offset by higher 
write-downs in our investment portfolio in 2019. 

Lease income was $1.6 billion in 2019, compared with 
$1.8 billion in 2018. The decrease in 2019, compared with 2018, 
was driven by reductions in the size of the equipment leasing 
portfolio. 

All other income was $2.5 billion in 2019, compared with 

$1.8 billion in 2018. All other income includes losses on low 
income housing tax credit investments (excluding related tax 
credits recorded in income tax expense), foreign currency 
adjustments, income from investments accounted for under the 
equity method, hedge accounting results related to hedges of 
foreign currency risk, and the results of certain economic hedges, 
any of which can cause decreases and net losses in other income. 
The increase in all other income in 2019, compared with 2018, 
was predominantly driven by pre-tax gains on the sales of our IRT 
business, Eastdil, and Business Payroll Services, partially offset 
by lower gains from the sales of purchased credit-impaired (PCI) 
loans in 2019, as well as higher losses on low income housing tax 
credit investments in 2019.

Represents expenses for both leased and owned properties. 
The amount for 2017 has been revised to conform with the current period presentation 
whereby temporary help is included in contract services rather than in all other noninterest 
expense. 
Represents expenses for assets we lease to customers. 

Noninterest expense was $58.2 billion in 2019, up 4% from 
$56.1 billion in 2018, which was down 4% from $58.5 billion in 
2017. The increase in 2019, compared with 2018, was driven by 
higher personnel expenses, operating losses, technology and 
equipment, and advertising and promotion expense, partially 
offset by lower core deposit and other intangibles expense, 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), leases, and other 
expense. The decrease in 2018, compared with 2017, was driven 
by lower operating losses from a decline in litigation accruals, 
lower personnel expenses, lower outside data processing, and 
lower FDIC expense, partially offset by higher advertising and 
promotion, technology and equipment, and other expense. 

Personnel expenses, which include salaries, commissions, 

incentive compensation and employee benefits, were up 
$2.1 billion, or 6%, in 2019, compared with 2018, due to higher 
deferred compensation costs (offset in net gains from equity 
securities), higher salaries driven by the impact of staffing mix 
changes and annual salary increases, as well as higher incentive 
compensation and commissions. The increase in incentive 
compensation and commissions was due to increased revenue 
from mortgage banking originations, market sensitive 
businesses (trading, debt and equity securities activities) and 
investment banking, partially offset by lower brokerage fees.

related investments.

Technology and equipment expense was up 13% in 2019, 
compared with 2018, due to higher impairment expenses on 
capitalized software and computer software licensing and 
maintenance costs, reflecting the strategic reassessment of 
technology projects in WIM. 

Core deposit and other intangibles expense was down 90% 

in 2019, compared with 2018, due to lower amortization 
expense reflecting the end of the 10-year amortization period on 
Wachovia intangibles. 

 FDIC and other deposit assessments were down 53% in 
2019, compared with 2018, due to the completion of the FDIC 
surcharge which ended September 30, 2018. 

Operating losses were up $1.2 billion, or 38%, in 2019, 
compared with 2018, due to higher litigation accruals for a 
variety of matters, including previously disclosed retail sales 
practices matters, partially offset by lower remediation expense. 

Outside professional and contract services expense was up 

3% in 2019, compared with 2018, reflecting an increase in 
project spending, partially offset by lower legal expense. 

Leases expense was down 13% in 2019, compared with 
2018, driven by reductions in the size of the operating lease 
portfolio. 

Advertising and promotion expense was up 26% in 2019, 
compared with 2018, due to increases in marketing and brand 
campaign volumes. 

All other noninterest expense was down 10% in 2019, 
compared with 2018, due to a sales tax refund in 2019, higher 
gains on the sale of corporate properties in 2019, compared with 
2018, and pension plan settlement expense in 2018 that did not 
recur in 2019. 

Income Tax Expense 
Our effective income tax rate in 2019 was 17.5%, compared with 
20.2% in 2018. The 2019 and 2018 effective income tax rates 
reflected the non-tax-deductible treatment of certain litigation 
accruals. The 2018 effective income tax rate also reflected 
income tax expense related to the reconsideration of reserves 
for state income taxes following the U.S. Supreme Court decision 
in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. and the recognition of 
$164 million of income tax expense associated with the final re-
measurement of our initial estimates for the impacts of the Tax 
Cuts & Jobs Act (Tax Act). See Note 24 (Income Taxes) to 
Financial Statements in this Report for additional information 
about our income taxes.

Operating Segment Results 
As of December 31, 2019, we were organized for management 
reporting purposes into three operating segments: Community 
Banking; Wholesale Banking; and Wealth and Investment 
Management (WIM). These segments are defined by product 
type and customer segment and their results are based on our 
management reporting process. The management reporting 
process is based on U.S. GAAP with specific adjustments, such as 
for funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, for 
shared revenues and expenses, and tax-equivalent adjustments 
to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt 
sources. On February 11, 2020, we announced a new 
organizational structure with five principal lines of business: 
Consumer and Small Business Banking; Consumer Lending; 
Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and 
Wealth and Investment Management. This new organizational 

Table 9:  Operating Segment Results – Highlights 

structure is intended to help drive operating, control, and 
business performance. The Company is currently in the process 
of transitioning to this new organizational structure, including 
identifying leadership for some of these principal business lines 
and aligning management reporting and allocation 
methodologies. These changes will not impact the consolidated 
financial results of the Company, but are expected to result in 
changes to our operating segments. We will update our 
operating segment disclosures, including comparative financial 
results, when the Company completes its transition and is 
managed in accordance with the new organizational structure. 
Table 9 and the following discussion present our results by 
operating segment. For additional description of our operating 
segments, including additional financial information and the 
underlying management reporting process, see Note 27

Wells Fargo & Company 

Community Banking reported net income of $7.4 billion in 

Income tax expense was $2.4 billion in 2019, down 

$1.4 billion from $3.8 billion in 2018. The decrease in income tax 
expense in 2019 was driven by lower pre-tax income, and 
reflected the non-tax-deductible treatment of certain litigation 
accruals. 

Average loans decreased $4.3 billion in 2019, or 1%, from 

2018 driven by decreases in real estate 1-4 family junior lien 
mortgage, automobile, other revolving credit and installment, 
and commercial loans, partially offset by higher real estate 1-4 
family first mortgage and credit card loans. Average deposits 
increased $24.8 billion in 2019, or 3%, from 2018. 

2019, down $3.0 billion, or 29%, from 2018. Revenue was 
$45.3 billion in 2019, down $1.6 billion, or 3%, from 2018. The 
decrease in revenue in 2019 was due to lower net interest 
income, gains from the sales of purchased credit-impaired (PCI) 
residential mortgage loans, mortgage banking revenue driven by 
a decrease in servicing income, and trust and investment fees, 
partially offset by higher gains on equity securities, service 
charges on deposit accounts, and card fees. 

The provision for credit losses in 2019 increased 

$536 million from 2018 due to a higher level of credit quality 
improvement in 2018 compared with 2019, partially offset by 
lower net charge-offs in the automobile portfolio in 2019. 

Noninterest expense of $32.7 billion in 2019 increased 

$2.2 billion, or 7%, from 2018. The increase in 2019 was 
predominantly driven by higher personnel expense, operating 
losses reflecting litigation accruals for a variety of matters, 
including previously disclosed retail sales practices matters, and 
outside professional services expense, partially offset by lower 
other expense, core deposit and other intangibles amortization 
expense, and FDIC and other deposit assessments expense.

Income tax expense for our Wholesale Banking operating segment included income tax credits related to low-income housing and renewable energy investments of $1.8 billion, $1.6 billion and 
$1.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Wholesale Banking reported net income of $10.7 billion in 

The provision for credit losses in 2019 increased 

2019, down $336 million, or 3%, from 2018. The decrease in 
2019 was predominantly due to lower net interest income, 
partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Revenue of 
$27.7 billion in 2019 decreased $1.0 billion, or 4%, from 2018. 
Net interest income of $17.7 billion in 2019 decreased 
$1.0 billion, or 5%, from 2018. The decrease in net interest 
income in 2019 was due to lower credit spreads on loans, trading 
assets, and debt securities, as well as the impact of migration 
from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits. 

Noninterest income of $10.0 billion in 2019 was flat 

compared with 2018. 

$436 million from 2018, driven by lower recoveries reflecting a 
higher level of credit quality improvement in 2018 compared 
with 2019. 

Noninterest expense of $15.4 billion in 2019 decreased 
$805 million, or 5%, compared with 2018. The decrease in 2019 
was predominantly due to lower core deposit and other 
intangibles amortization expense, FDIC and other deposit 
assessments expense, operating losses, and lease expense 
(within other expense), as well as the impact of the sale of 
Eastdil, partially offset by increased project expense (within 
other expense).

Average loans of $475.3 billion in 2019 increased 

$9.6 billion, or 2%, compared with 2018. Loan growth in 2019 
from commercial and industrial loans was partially offset by 
declines in commercial real estate loans. Average deposits of 
$422.5 billion in 2019 decreased $1.2 billion from 2018. The 
decline in 2019 was driven by commercial customers allocating 
more cash to alternative higher-rate liquid investments.

WIM reported net income of $2.7 billion in 2019, up 

$133 million, or 5%, from 2018. Revenue of $17.3 billion in 2019 
increased $965 million, or 6%, from 2018. 

Net interest income of $4.0 billion in 2019 decreased 

$404 million, or 9%, from 2018 predominantly due to the impact 
of lower deposit balances. 

Noninterest income of $13.3 billion in 2019 increased 
$1.4 billion, or 11%, from 2018, predominantly due to the 
$1.1 billion gain on the sale of our IRT business and higher net 
gains from equity securities on increased deferred compensation 
plan investment results (largely offset by higher employee 
benefits expense), partially offset by lower asset-based fees. 

Wells Fargo & Company

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Noninterest income in 2018 reflected an impairment on the sale 
of our ownership stake in RockCreek. 

The provision for credit losses was $5 million in 2019, 

compared with a reversal of provision of $5 million in 2018. 
Noninterest expense of $13.7 billion in 2019 increased 
$771 million, or 6%, from 2018 due to higher personnel expense 
on increased deferred compensation plan expense (offset in net 
gains from equity securities), technology and equipment expense 
including $265 million of capitalized software impairment and 
computer software licensing and maintenance costs, reflecting 
the strategic reassessment of technology projects, operating 
losses, and project expense (within other expense), partially 
offset by lower core deposits and other intangibles amortization 
expense. 

Average loans of $75.6 billion in 2019 increased $1.0 billion 
from 2018 driven by growth in nonconforming mortgage loans. 
Average deposits of $146.0 billion in 2019 decreased 
$19.0 billion, or 12%, from 2018 as customers allocated more 
cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives. 

The following discussions provide additional information for 
client assets we oversee in our retail brokerage advisory and trust 
and investment management business lines. 

Retail Brokerage Client Assets Brokerage advisory, 
commissions and other fees are received for providing full-
service and discount brokerage services predominantly to retail 
brokerage clients. Offering advisory account relationships to our 
brokerage clients is an important component of our broader 
strategy of meeting their financial needs. Although a majority of 
our retail brokerage client assets are in accounts that earn 
brokerage commissions, the fees from those accounts generally 
represent transactional commissions based on the number and 
size of transactions executed at the client’s direction. Fees from 
advisory accounts are based on a percentage of the market value 
of the assets as of the beginning of the quarter, which vary 
across the account types based on the distinct services provided, 
and are affected by investment performance as well as asset 
inflows and outflows. A majority of our brokerage advisory, 
commissions and other fee income is earned from advisory 
accounts. Table 9d shows advisory account client assets as a 
percentage of total retail brokerage client assets at 
December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Retail Brokerage advisory accounts include assets that are 
financial advisor-directed and separately managed by third-party 
managers, as well as certain client-directed brokerage assets 
where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not 
have investment discretion. For the years ended December 31, 
2019, 2018 and 2017, the average fee rate by account type 

ranged from 80 to 120 basis points. Table 9e presents retail 
brokerage advisory account client assets activity by account type 
for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The 
activity in 2019 reflected higher market valuations and net 
outflows primarily from the correspondent clearing business.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Trust and Investment Client Assets Under Management We 
earn trust and investment management fees from managing and 
administering assets, including mutual funds, separate accounts, 
and personal trust assets, through our asset management and 
wealth businesses. Prior to the sale of our IRT business, which 
closed on July 1, 2019, we also earned fees from managing 
employee benefit trusts through the retirement business. Our 
asset management business is conducted by Wells Fargo Asset 
Management (WFAM), which offers Wells Fargo proprietary 
mutual funds and manages institutional separate accounts, and 

our wealth business manages assets for high net worth clients. 
Substantially all of our trust and investment management fee 
income is earned from AUM where we have discretionary 
management authority over the investments and generate fees 
as a percentage of the market value of the AUM. For additional 
information on the sale of our IRT business, including its impact 
on our AUM, AUA and associated revenue and expenses, see the

Balance Sheet Analysis 

At December 31, 2019, our assets totaled $1.9 trillion, up 
$31.7 billion from December 31, 2018. Asset growth was 
predominantly due to increases in federal funds sold and 
securities purchased under resale agreements, debt securities, 
and equity securities, which increased $21.9 billion, $12.4 billion, 
and $13.1 billion, respectively, partially offset by a $30.2 billion 
decline in interest-earning deposits with banks. 

Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities

about the major components of our balance sheet. Information 
regarding our capital and changes in our asset mix is included in

Available-for-sale debt securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost. 

Table 10 presents a summary of our available-for-sale and held-
to-maturity debt securities, which increased $2.7 billion in 
balance sheet carrying value from December 31, 2018, due to 
higher net unrealized gains, partially offset by paydowns, sales 
and maturities exceeding purchases. 

The total net unrealized gains on available-for-sale debt 
securities were $3.4 billion at December 31, 2019, up from net 
unrealized losses of $2.6 billion at December 31, 2018, driven by 
lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads. 

The size and composition of our available-for-sale and held-

to-maturity debt securities is dependent upon the Company’s 
liquidity and interest rate risk management objectives. Our 
business generates assets and liabilities, such as loans, deposits 
and long-term debt, which have different maturities, yields, re-
pricing, prepayment characteristics and other provisions that 
expose us to interest rate and liquidity risk. 

The available-for-sale debt securities portfolio primarily 
consists of liquid, high-quality U.S. Treasury and federal agency 
debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), in addition 
to securities issued by U.S. states and political subdivisions, 
corporate debt securities, and highly rated collateralized loan 
obligations (CLOs). The available-for-sale debt securities 
portfolio can be used to meet funding needs that arise in the 
normal course of business or due to market stress. Changes in 
our interest rate risk profile may occur due to changes in overall 
economic or market conditions, which could influence loan 
origination demand, prepayment speeds, or deposit balances and 
mix. In response, the available-for-sale debt securities portfolio 
can be rebalanced to meet the Company’s interest rate risk 
management objectives. In addition to meeting liquidity and 
interest rate risk management objectives, the available-for-sale 
debt securities portfolio may provide yield enhancement over 
other short-term assets. See the “Risk Management – Asset/ 
Liability Management” section in this Report for more 
information on liquidity and interest rate risk. 

The held-to-maturity debt securities portfolio 

predominantly consists of high-quality U.S. Treasury debt, 
agency MBS and securities issued by U.S. states and political 
subdivisions where our intent is to hold these securities to 
maturity and collect the contractual cash flows. The held-to-
maturity debt securities portfolio may also provide yield 
enhancement over short-term assets. 

We analyze debt securities for OTTI quarterly or more 

often if a potential loss-triggering event occurs. In 2019, we 
recognized $63 million of OTTI write-downs on debt 
securities. For a discussion of our OTTI accounting policies and 
underlying considerations and analysis, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 5 (Available-for-Sale 
and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in 
this Report. 

At December 31, 2019, debt securities included $53.8 billion 

of municipal bonds, of which 96.9% were rated “A-” or better 
based predominantly on external ratings. Additionally, some of 
the debt securities in our total municipal bond portfolio are 
guaranteed against loss by bond insurers. These guaranteed 
bonds are predominantly investment grade and were generally 
underwritten in accordance with our own investment standards 
prior to the determination to purchase, without relying on the 
bond insurer’s guarantee in making the investment decision. The 
credit quality of our municipal bond holdings are monitored as 
part of our ongoing impairment analysis. 

The weighted-average expected maturity of debt securities 

available-for-sale was 4.7 years at December 31, 2019. The 
expected remaining maturity is shorter than the remaining 
contractual maturity for the 63.5% of this portfolio that is MBS 
because borrowers generally have the right to prepay obligations 
before the underlying mortgages mature. The estimated effects 
of a 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on the 
fair value and the expected remaining maturity of the MBS 
available-for-sale portfolio are shown in Table 11.

The weighted-average expected remaining maturity of debt 

securities held-to-maturity (HTM) was 4.9 years at 
December 31, 2019. HTM debt securities are measured at 
amortized cost and, therefore, changes in the fair value of our 
held-to-maturity MBS resulting from changes in interest rates 
are not recognized in earnings. See Note 5 (Available-for-Sale 
and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in 
this Report for a summary of debt securities by security type. 

Loan Portfolios 
Table 12 provides a summary of total outstanding loans by 
portfolio segment. Total loans increased $9.2 billion from 
December 31, 2018, largely driven by an increase in consumer 
loans. 

Consumer loans were up $6.8 billion from December 31, 
2018, predominantly due to growth in the real estate 1-4 family 
first mortgage portfolio, as mortgage loan originations were 
partially offset by paydowns and $4.0 billion of sales of PCI loans, 
predominantly Pick-a-Pay, in 2019. We also purchased 
$3.3 billion of mortgage loans in 2019 as a result of exercising 
servicer cleanup calls. In addition, during 2019, we reclassified 
$1.9 billion of existing mortgage loans to MLHFS in anticipation 
of future whole loan sales. 

Commercial loans also increased from December 31, 2018, 

predominantly driven by growth in our commercial and industrial 
loan portfolio, reflecting growth in our Corporate and 
Investment Banking business and purchases of CLOs in loan form 
within our Credit Investment Portfolio, partially offset by 
declines in our Commercial Banking business.

Deposits 
Deposits were $1.3 trillion at December 31, 2019, up 
$36.5 billion from December 31, 2018, due to an increase in 
commercial deposits, consumer and small business banking 
deposits, and mortgage escrow deposits reflecting an inflow of 
higher mortgage payoffs to be remitted to investors in 
accordance with servicing contracts, partially offset by a 
decrease in other time deposits. The increase in commercial 
deposits was due to higher balances in corporate and investment 
banking deposits, and commercial real estate deposits. The 

increase in consumer and small business banking deposits was 
due to higher balances in high-yield savings, certificates of 
deposit (CDs), and noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset 
by declines in brokerage sweeps. Table 14 provides additional 
information regarding deposits. Information regarding the 
impact of deposits on net interest income and a comparison of 
average deposit balances is provided in the “Earnings 
Performance – Net Interest Income” section and Table 5 earlier in 
this Report.

Includes Eurodollar sweep balances of $34.2 billion and $31.8 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

Equity 
Total equity was $188.0 billion at December 31, 2019, compared 
with $197.1 billion at December 31, 2018. The decrease was 
driven by a $21.6 billion increase in treasury stock and a 
$1.7 billion decline in preferred stock, partially offset by an 
$8.5 billion increase in retained earnings net of dividends paid, 
and a $5.0 billion increase in cumulative other comprehensive 
income predominantly due to fair value adjustments to available-
for-sale debt securities. The increase in treasury stock was the 
result of the repurchase of 502.4 million shares of common stock 
in 2019, an increase of 34% from 2018.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial 
transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet, or may 
be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different 
from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. Our 
off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments to lend 
and purchase debt and equity securities, transactions with 
unconsolidated entities, guarantees, derivatives, and other 
commitments. These transactions are designed to (1) meet the 
financial needs of customers, (2) manage our credit, market or 
liquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify our funding sources. 

Guarantees and Other Arrangements 
Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby letters of credit, direct pay 
letters of credit, written options, recourse obligations, exchange 
and clearing house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types 
of similar arrangements. For more information, see Note 16 
(Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral, and Other 
Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Derivatives 
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to 
assist customers with their risk management objectives. 
Derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, and 
volume can be measured in terms of the notional amount, which 
is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which 
interest and other payments are determined. The notional 
amount is not recorded on the balance sheet and is not, when 
viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of 
the instruments. For more information, see Note 18 
(Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Commitments to Lend 
We enter into commitments to lend to customers, which are 
usually at a stated interest rate, if funded, and for specific 
purposes and time periods. When we enter into commitments, 
we are exposed to credit risk. The maximum credit risk for these 
commitments will generally be lower than the contractual 
amount because a significant portion of these commitments are 
not funded. For more information, see Note 6 (Loans and 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Commitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities 
We enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale 
agreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ 
funding, liquidity or other future needs. For more information, 
see Note 16 (Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral, and 
Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities 
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability 
companies or partnerships that are established for a limited 
purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with 
securitization transactions and are considered variable interest 
entities (VIEs). For more information, see Note 10 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report.

Wells Fargo & Company 

Contractual Cash Obligations 
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into other 
contractual obligations that may require future cash payments, 
including debt issuances for the funding of operations and leases 
for premises and equipment. 

Table 15 summarizes these contractual obligations as of 

December 31, 2019, excluding accrued expenses and other 
liabilities, short-term borrowings and obligations for pension and 
postretirement benefit plans. For more information, see Note 14 
(Short-Term Borrowings) and Note 23 (Employee Benefits and 
Other Expenses) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Balances are presented net of unamortized debt discounts and premiums and purchase accounting adjustments. 
Represents the future interest obligations related to interest-bearing time deposits and long-term debt in the normal course of business including a net reduction of $7.1 billion related to hedges 
used to manage interest rate risk. These interest obligations assume no early debt redemption. We estimated variable interest rate payments using December 31, 2019, rates, which we held 
constant until maturity. We have excluded interest related to structured notes where our payment obligation is contingent on the performance of certain benchmarks. 
Includes unfunded commitments to purchase debt securities of $18 million and equity securities of $2.7 billion, respectively. Substantially all of our equity commitments are included in the ‘Less than 
one year’ category as there are no specified contribution dates in the agreements. These obligations may be requested at any time by the investment manager. 
Represents agreements related to unrecognized obligations to purchase goods or services. 

We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states 

and municipalities, and those of the non-U.S. jurisdictions in 
which we operate. We have various unrecognized tax obligations 
related to these operations that may require future cash tax 
payments to various taxing authorities. Because of their 
uncertain nature, the expected timing and amounts of these 
payments generally are not reasonably estimable or 
determinable. We attempt to estimate the amount payable in 
the next 12 months based on the status of our tax examinations 
and settlement discussions. See Note 24 (Income Taxes) to 
Financial Statements in this Report for more information.

Risk Management 

Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly 
affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the 
expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and 
other stakeholders. 

Risk is Part of our Business Model  The Company measures and 
manages risk as part of our business, including in connection with 
the products and services we offer to our customers. The risks 
we take include financial, such as credit, interest rate, market, 
liquidity and funding risks, and non-financial, such as operational 
including compliance and model risks, strategic and reputation 
risks. 

Risk Profile  Our risk profile is a holistic view of all risks we hold 
at a point in time, including emerging risks. The Company 
monitors its risk profile, and the Board periodically reviews 
reports and analysis concerning our risk profile. 

Risk Capacity  Risk capacity refers to the maximum level of risk 
that the Company could assume given its current level of 
resources before triggering regulatory and other constraints on 
its capital and liquidity needs. 

Risk Appetite  Management defines and the Board approves the 
Company’s risk appetite, which is the amount of risk the 
Company is comfortable taking given its current level of 
resources. Risk appetite defines which risks are acceptable and at 
what level and guides business and risk leaders. Risk appetite 
boundaries are set within the Company’s risk capacity. The 
Company’s risk appetite is articulated in a statement of risk 
appetite, which is approved at least annually by the Board. The 
Company continuously monitors its risk appetite, and the Board 
reviews periodic risk appetite reports and analysis. 

Risk and Strategy  The Company’s risk profile, risk capacity, risk 
appetite, and risk management effectiveness (e.g., the holistic 
measure of the quality and effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management activities, including the functional or programmatic 
use of controls and capabilities to manage risks) are considered 
in the strategic planning process, which is closely linked with the 
Company’s capital planning process. The Company’s Independent 
Risk Management (IRM) organization participates in strategic 
planning at several points in the process, providing challenge to 
and independent assessment of the Company’s self-assessment 
of the risks associated with strategic planning initiatives. IRM 
also independently assesses the impact of the strategic plan on 
risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness at 
the business group, enterprise function, and aggregate Company 
level. Risk decisions related to the strategic plan are approved by 
the Enterprise Risk & Control Committee (ERCC), a management 
governance committee that governs the management of all risk 
types. After a critical review, the strategic plan is presented to 
the Board each year for review and approval. 

Everyone Manages Risk  Every team member creates risk in the 
course of performing business activities and is required to 
manage that risk. Risk is everyone’s responsibility. Every team 
member is required to comply with applicable laws, regulations, 
and Company policies. 

Risk and Culture  The Board holds management accountable for 
establishing and maintaining the right risk culture and effectively 
managing risk. Team members are strongly encouraged and 
expected to speak up when they see something that could cause 
harm to the Company’s customers, communities, team 
members, shareholders, or reputation. Because risk management 
is everyone’s responsibility, all team members are expected to 
challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to escalate their 
concerns when they have not been addressed. Team member 
performance evaluations are tied to, and take into account, 
effective risk management. The Company’s performance 
management and incentive compensation programs are 
designed to establish a balanced framework for risk and reward 
under core principles that team members are expected to know 
and practice. The Board, through its Human Resources 
Committee, plays an important role in overseeing and providing 
credible challenge to the Company’s performance management 
and incentive compensation programs. 

Risk Management Framework  The Company’s risk 
management framework sets forth the core principles on how 
the Company seeks to manage and govern its risk. Many 
Company policies and documents anchor to the risk 
management framework’s core principles. The Board’s Risk 
Committee annually reviews and approves the risk management 
framework. 

Risk Governance 
Role of the Board  The Board oversees the Company’s business, 
including its risk management. The Board assesses 
management’s performance, provides credible challenge, and 
holds management accountable for maintaining an effective risk 
management program and for adhering to risk management 
expectations. 

Board Committee Structure  The Board carries out its risk 
oversight responsibilities directly and through its committees. 

The Risk Committee approves the Company’s risk 
management framework and oversees its implementation, 
including the processes established by management to identify, 
assess, measure, monitor, and manage risks. It also monitors the 
Company’s adherence to its risk appetite. In addition, the Risk 
Committee oversees IRM and the performance of the Chief Risk 
Officer (CRO) who reports functionally to the Risk Committee 
and administratively to the CEO. 

Management Committee Structure  The Company has 
established management committees, including those focused 
on risk, that support management in carrying out its governance 
and risk management responsibilities. One type of management 
committee is a governance committee, which is a decision 
making body that operates for a particular purpose. 

Each management governance committee is expected to 
discuss, document, and make decisions regarding significant risk 
issues, emerging risks, and risk acceptances; review and monitor 
progress related to critical and high-risk issues and remediation 
efforts within its scope, including lessons learned; and report key 
challenges, decisions, escalations, other actions, and open issues 
as appropriate.

The Audit Committee additionally oversees the internal audit function; external auditor independence, activities, and performance; and the disclosure framework for financial, regulatory and risk 
reports prepared for the Board, management, and bank regulatory agencies; and assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. 

Management Governance Committees Reporting to the Risk 
Committee of the Board  The ERCC governs the management of 
all risk types, including financial risks and non-financial risks. The 
ERCC receives information about risk and control events, 
addresses escalated risks and issues, actively oversees risk 
control, and provides regular updates to the Risk Committee 
regarding current and emerging risks and management’s 
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management program. 

The ERCC is chaired by the CRO, with membership made up 

of the CEO and the heads of business groups and certain 
enterprise functions. The Chief Auditor attends all meetings of 
the ERCC. The ERCC has a direct escalation path to the Risk 
Committee. The ERCC also escalates credit risks and issues to 
the Credit Committee and certain human capital risks and issues 
to the Human Resources Committee. In addition, the CRO has 
the authority to escalate anything directly to the Board. Risks 
and issues are escalated to the ERCC in accordance with 
applicable policies and procedures governing escalations. 

Each business group and enterprise function has a risk and 

control committee, which are management governance 
committees with mandates that align with the ERCC but with 
their scope limited to the relevant business groups or enterprise 
functions. The focus of these committees is on the risks that 
each business group or enterprise function generates and is 
responsible for managing, and the controls each business group 
or enterprise function is expected to have in place. 

In addition to each risk and control committee, management 

governance committees dedicated to specific risk types and risk 
topics also report to the ERCC to help provide more 
comprehensive governance of risks. 

Risk Operating Model - Roles and Responsibilities 
The Company has three lines of defense: the front line, 
Independent Risk Management, and Internal Audit. Our risk 
operating model creates necessary interaction, 
interdependencies, and ongoing engagement among the lines of 
defense: 
• 

Front Line  The front line, which is composed of business 
groups and certain activities of enterprise functions, is the 
first line of defense. In the course of its business activities, 
the front line identifies, measures and assesses, manages, 
controls, monitors, and reports on risk associated with its 
business activities and balances risk and reward in decision 
making while remaining within the Company’s risk appetite. 
Independent Risk Management  IRM is the second line of 
defense. It establishes and maintains the Company’s risk 
management program and provides oversight, including 
challenge to and independent assessment of the front line’s 
execution of its risk management responsibilities. 
Internal Audit  Internal Audit is the third line of defense. It is 
responsible for acting as an independent assurance function 
and validates that the risk management program is 
adequately designed and functioning effectively. 

• 

• 

Risk Type Classifications 
The Company uses common classifications, hierarchies, and 
ratings to enable consistency across risk management programs 
and aggregation of information. Risk type classifications permit 
the Company to identify and prioritize its risk exposures, 
including emerging risk exposures.

Risk Management (continued) 

Operational Risk Management 
Operational risk, which in addition to those discussed in this 
section, includes compliance risk and model risk, is the risk 
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people 
and systems, or from external events. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for all aspects of operational risk, including 
significant supporting programs and/or policies regarding the 
Company’s business resiliency and disaster recovery, data 
management, information security, technology, and third-party 
risk management. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the 
Board’s Risk Committee approves the operational risk statement 
of risk appetite including inner and outer boundary thresholds, 
reviews and approves significant operational risk policies, and 
oversees the Company’s operational risk management program. 
At the management level, the Operational Risk Group 

organization, which is part of IRM, has primary oversight 
responsibility for operational risk. The Operational Risk Group 
reports to the CRO and also provides periodic reports related to 
operational risk to the Board’s Risk Committee. Technology, 
Third Party and Information Risk Oversight, which is part of the 
Operational Risk Group, has oversight responsibility for 
technology risk, third-party risk, information risk management, 
and information security risk. Enterprise Data Governance, which 
is part of the Operational Risk Group, has oversight responsibility 
for data management risk. Oversight of human capital risk, an 
operational risk, is performed by the Human Resources function 
with reporting paths to relevant management governance 
committees including to the ERCC. 

Information security is a significant operational risk for 
financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, and includes the risk 
arising from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, 
modification, or destruction of information or information 
systems. The Board is actively engaged in the oversight of the 
Company’s information security risk management and cyber 
defense programs. The Board’s Risk Committee has primary 
oversight responsibility for information security risk and 
approves the Company’s information security program, which 
includes the information security policy and the cyber defense 
program. A Technology Subcommittee of the Risk Committee 
assists the Risk Committee in providing oversight of technology, 
information security, and cybersecurity risks as well as data 
management risk. The Technology Subcommittee reviews and 
recommends to the Risk Committee for approval any significant 
supporting information security risk (including cybersecurity 
risk), technology risk, and data management risk programs and/ 
or policies, including the Company’s data management strategy. 
The Technology Subcommittee reports to the Risk Committee 
and both provide updates to the full Board. 

Wells Fargo and other financial institutions continue to be 

the target of various evolving and adaptive cyber attacks, 
including malware and denial-of-service, as part of an effort to 
disrupt the operations of financial institutions, potentially test 
their cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain 
confidential, proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks 
have also focused on targeting online applications and services, 
such as online banking, as well as cloud-based services provided 
by third parties, and have targeted the infrastructure of the 
internet causing the widespread unavailability of websites and 
degrading website performance. Wells Fargo has not experienced 
any material losses relating to these or other types of cyber 
attacks. Cybersecurity risk is a priority for Wells Fargo, and we 
continue to develop and enhance our controls, processes and 
systems in order to protect our networks, computers, software 
and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. Wells 

Fargo is also proactively involved in industry cybersecurity 
efforts and working with other parties, including our third-party 
service providers and governmental agencies, to continue to 
enhance defenses and improve resiliency to cybersecurity 
threats. See the “Risk Factors” section in this Report for 
additional information regarding the risks associated with a 
failure or breach of our operational or security systems or 
infrastructure, including as a result of cyber attacks. 

Compliance Risk Management 
Compliance risk (a type of operational risk) is the risk resulting 
from the failure to comply with laws (legislation, regulations and 
rules) and regulatory guidance, and the failure to appropriately 
address associated impacts, including to customers. Compliance 
risk encompasses violations of applicable internal policies, 
program requirements, procedures, and standards related to 
ethical principles applicable to the banking industry. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for all aspects of compliance risk, including 
financial crimes risk. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the 
Board’s Risk Committee approves the compliance risk and 
financial crimes risk statement of risk appetites including inner 
and outer boundary thresholds, reviews and approves significant 
supporting compliance risk and financial crimes risk policies and 
programs, and oversees the Company’s compliance risk 
management and financial crimes risk management programs. A 
Compliance Subcommittee of the Risk Committee assists the 
Risk Committee in providing oversight of the Company’s 
compliance program and compliance risk management. The 
Compliance Subcommittee reports to the Risk Committee and 
both provide updates to the full Board. 

Conduct risk, a sub-category of compliance risk, is the risk of 

inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior on the part of 
team members or individuals acting on behalf of the Company, 
caused by deliberate or unintentional actions or business 
practices. The Board has enhanced its oversight of conduct risk 
to oversee the alignment of team member conduct to the 
Company’s risk appetite (which the Board approves annually). 
The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility 
for enterprise-wide conduct risk and risk management 
components of the Company’s culture, while the responsibilities 
of the Board’s Human Resources Committee include oversight of 
the Company’s enterprise-wide culture, Code of Ethics and 
Business Conduct, conflicts of interest program, human capital 
management (including talent management and succession 
planning), performance management program, and incentive 
compensation risk management program. 

At the management level, Wells Fargo Compliance, which is 

part of IRM, monitors the implementation of the Company’s 
compliance and conduct risk programs. Financial Crimes Risk 
Management, which is part of Wells Fargo Compliance, oversees 
and monitors financial crimes risk. Wells Fargo Compliance 
reports to the CRO and also provides periodic reports related to 
compliance risk to the Board’s Risk Committee and Compliance 
Subcommittee. We continue to enhance our oversight of 
operational and compliance risk management, including as 
required by the FRB’s February 2, 2018, and the CFPB/OCC’s 
April 20, 2018, consent orders. 

Model Risk Management 
Model risk (a type of operational risk) is the risk arising from the 
potential for adverse consequences from decisions made based 
on model outputs that may be incorrect or used inappropriately. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for model risk. As part of its oversight 

58 

Wells Fargo & Company 

responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee oversees the 
Company’s model risk management policy, model validation 
activities, model performance, model issue remediation status, 
and adherence to model risk appetite metrics. 

At the management level, the Model Risk function, which is 
part of IRM, has primary oversight responsibility for model risk 
and is responsible for governance, validation and monitoring of 
model risk across the Company. The Model Risk function reports 
to the CRO and also provides periodic reports related to model 
risk to the Board’s Risk Committee. 

Strategic Risk Management 
Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, or liquidity arising 
from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of 
strategic initiatives, or inadequate responses to changes in the 
external operating environment. 

The Board has primary oversight responsibility for strategic 

planning and oversees management’s development and 
implementation of and approves the Company’s strategic plan, 
and considers whether it is aligned with the Company’s risk 
appetite and risk management effectiveness. Management 
develops, executes and recommends strategic corporate 
transactions and the Board evaluates management’s proposals, 
including their impact on the Company’s risk profile and financial 
position. The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for the Company’s strategic risk and the adequacy 
of the Company’s strategic risk management program, including 
associated risk management practices, processes and controls. 
The Board’s Risk Committee also receives updates from 
management regarding new business initiatives activity and risks 
related to new or changing products, as appropriate. 

At the management level, the Strategic Risk Oversight 

function, which is part of IRM, has primary oversight 
responsibility for strategic risk. The Strategic Risk Oversight 
function reports into the CRO and also provides periodic reports 
related to strategic risk to the Board’s Risk Committee. 

Reputation Risk Management 
Reputation risk is the risk arising from the potential that 
negative stakeholder opinion or negative publicity regarding the 
Company’s business practices, whether true or not, will adversely 
impact current or projected financial conditions and resilience, 
cause a decline in the customer base, or result in costly litigation. 
Stakeholders include team members, customers, communities, 
shareholders, regulators, elected officials, advocacy groups, and 
media organizations. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for company-wide reputation risk, while each 
Board committee has reputation risk oversight responsibilities 
related to their primary oversight responsibilities. As part of its 
oversight responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee receives 
reports from management that help it monitor how effectively 
the Company is managing reputation risk. As part of its oversight 
responsibilities for social and public responsibility matters, the 
Board’s Corporate Responsibility Committee also receives 
reports from management relating to the Company’s brand and 
stakeholder perception of the Company. 

At the management level, the Reputation Risk Oversight 

function, which is part of IRM, has primary oversight 
responsibility for reputation risk. The Reputation Risk Oversight 
function reports into the CRO and also provides periodic reports 
related to reputation risk to the Board’s Risk Committee. 

Credit Risk Management 
We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a 
borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in 
accordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many 
of our assets and exposures such as debt security holdings, 
certain derivatives, and loans. 

The Board’s Credit Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for credit risk. At the management level, Credit 
Risk, which is part of IRM, has primary oversight responsibility 
for credit risk. Credit Risk reports to the CRO and also provides 
periodic reports related to credit risk to the Board’s Credit 
Committee. 

The following discussion focuses on our loan portfolios, 
which represent the largest component of assets on our balance 
sheet for which we have credit risk. Table 17 presents our total 
loans outstanding by portfolio segment and class of financing

We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe 

are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while 
monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan 
portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and 
monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple 
risk factors affecting loans we hold, could acquire or originate 
including: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  Merger and acquisition activities 
• 

Loan concentrations and related credit quality 
Counterparty credit risk 
Economic and market conditions 
Legislative or regulatory mandates 
Changes in interest rates 

Reputation risk 

Our credit risk management oversight process is governed 

centrally, but provides for decentralized management and 
accountability by our lines of business. Our overall credit process 
includes comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit 
underwriting, frequent and detailed risk measurement and 
modeling, extensive credit training programs, and a continual 
loan review and audit process.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-
controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate 
for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase 
the loans or securities collateralized by the loans. 

Credit Quality Overview  Solid credit quality continued in 2019, 
as our net charge-off rate remained low at 0.29% of average 
total loans. Our loss rate reflected improvements in the credit 
performance of our automobile portfolio, partially offset by a 
lower volume of recoveries in other loan portfolios. In particular: 
•  Nonaccrual loans were $5.3 billion at December 31, 2019, 
down from $6.5 billion at December 31, 2018. Commercial 
nonaccrual loans increased to $2.3 billion at December 31, 
2019, compared with $2.2 billion at December 31, 2018, and 
consumer nonaccrual loans declined to $3.1 billion at 
December 31, 2019, compared with $4.3 billion at 
December 31, 2018. A decline in real estate 1-4 family 
mortgage nonaccrual loans reflecting an improved housing 
market, sales of nonaccrual mortgage loans, and the 
reclassification of nonaccrual mortgage loans to MLHFS was 
partially offset by an increase in commercial and industrial 
nonaccrual loans driven by the oil and gas portfolio. 
Nonaccrual loans represented 0.56% of total loans at 
December 31, 2019, compared with 0.68% at December 31, 
2018. 

•  Net charge-offs as a percentage of our average commercial 

• 

and consumer portfolios were 0.13% and 0.48%, 
respectively, in 2019, compared with 0.09% and 0.52% in 
2018. 
Loans that are not government insured/guaranteed and 
90 days or more past due and still accruing were $78 million 
and $855 million in our commercial and consumer 
portfolios, respectively, at December 31, 2019, compared 
with $94 million and $885 million at December 31, 2018. 

•  Our provision for credit losses was $2.7 billion in 2019, 

compared with $1.7 billion in 2018. The provision for credit 
losses in both 2019 and 2018 reflected continuing solid 
underlying credit performance. The provision for credit 
losses in 2018 also reflected a higher level of credit quality 
improvement compared with 2019, as well as an 
improvement in the outlook associated with 2017 
hurricane-related losses. 
The allowance for credit losses declined to $10.5 billion, or 
1.09% of total loans, at December 31, 2019, compared with 
$10.7 billion, or 1.12%, at December 31, 2018.

Additional information on our loan portfolios and our credit 

quality trends follows. 

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS  Loans acquired with 
evidence of credit deterioration since their origination and where 
it is probable that we will not collect all contractually required 
principal and interest payments are PCI loans. A nonaccretable 
difference is established for PCI loans to absorb losses expected 
on the contractual amounts of those loans. Amounts absorbed 
by the nonaccretable difference do not affect the income 
statement or the allowance for credit losses. The carrying value 
of PCI loans at December 31, 2019, totaled $568 million, 
compared with $5.0 billion at December 31, 2018. The decline in 
carrying value was due to the sale of $4.0 billion of PCI loans, 
predominantly Pick-a-Pay, during 2019 and paydowns. 

For additional information on PCI loans, see the “Risk 

Management – Credit Risk Management – Real Estate 1-4 Family 
Mortgage Loans – Pick-a-Pay Portfolio” section in this Report, 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 6 
(Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews  Measuring and monitoring 
our credit risk is an ongoing process that tracks delinquencies, 
collateral values, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, economic 
trends by geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain 
portfolios (typically commercial) and other indications of credit 
risk. Our credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable 
early identification of developing risk and to support our 
determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The 
following discussion provides additional characteristics and 
analysis of our significant portfolios. See Note 6 (Loans and 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report for more analysis and credit metric information for each 
of the following portfolios. 

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING  For 
purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate 
commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according 
to market segmentation and standard industry codes. We 
generally subject commercial and industrial loans and lease 
financing to individual risk assessment using our internal 
borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to 
regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with 
criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, 
doubtful and loss categories. 

The commercial and industrial loans and lease financing 

portfolio totaled $374.0 billion, or 39% of total loans, at 
December 31, 2019. The net charge-off rate for this portfolio 
was 0.18% in 2019, compared with 0.13% in 2018. At 
December 31, 2019, 0.44% of this portfolio was nonaccruing, 
compared with 0.43% at December 31, 2018. Nonaccrual loans in 
this portfolio increased $64 million in 2019, due to a customer in 
the utilities industry, as well as increases in the oil, gas and 
pipeline portfolio, partially offset by improvement across various 
industry categories. Also, $16.6 billion of the commercial and 
industrial loan and lease financing portfolio was internally 
classified as criticized in accordance with regulatory guidance at 
December 31, 2019, compared with $15.8 billion at 
December 31, 2018. 

Most of our commercial and industrial loans and lease 
financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as 
accounts receivable, inventory and debt securities, as well as 
long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. 
Generally, the collateral securing this portfolio represents a 
secondary source of repayment.

Table 18 provides our commercial and industrial loans and 

lease financing by industry, and includes non-U.S. loans of 
$71.7 billion and $63.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, 
respectively. Significant industry concentrations of non-U.S. 
loans include $31.2 billion and $25.6 billion in the financials 
except banks category and $19.9 billion and $18.1 billion in the 
banks category at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
The industry categories were updated in 2019 to align with 
industry groupings that our regulators use to monitor industry 
concentration risks. 

Loans to financials except banks, our largest industry 
concentration, were $117.3 billion, or 12% of total outstanding 
loans, at December 31, 2019, compared with $105.9 billion, or 

11% of total outstanding loans, at December 31, 2018. This 
industry category includes loans to investment firms, financial 
vehicles, and non-bank creditors, including those that invest in 
financial assets backed predominantly by commercial or 
residential real estate or consumer loan assets. We limit our loan 
amounts to a percentage of the value of the underlying assets 
considering underlying credit risk, asset duration, and ongoing 
performance. 

Oil, gas and pipeline loans totaled $13.6 billion, or 1% of 
total outstanding loans, at December 31, 2019, compared with 
$12.8 billion, or 1% of total outstanding loans, at December 31, 
2018.

Industry categories are based on the North American Industry Classification System and the amounts reported include non-U.S. loans. The industry categories were updated in 2019 to align with 
industry groupings that our regulators use to monitor industry concentration risks. The amounts for December 31, 2018, have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. See 
Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for a breakout of non-U.S. commercial loans. 
No other single industry had total loans in excess of $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

Risk mitigation actions, including the restructuring of 

repayment terms, securing collateral or guarantees, and entering 
into extensions, are based on a re-underwriting of the loan and 
our assessment of the borrower’s ability to perform under the 
agreed-upon terms. Extension terms generally range from six to 
thirty-six months and may require that the borrower provide 
additional economic support in the form of partial repayment, or 
additional collateral or guarantees. In cases where the value of 
collateral or financial condition of the borrower is insufficient to 
repay our loan, we may rely upon the support of an outside 
repayment guarantee in providing the extension. 

Our ability to seek performance under a guarantee is directly 

related to the guarantor’s creditworthiness, capacity and 
willingness to perform, which is evaluated on an annual basis, or 
more frequently as warranted. Our evaluation is based on the 
most current financial information available and is focused on 
various key financial metrics, including net worth, leverage, and 
current and future liquidity. We consider the guarantor’s 
reputation, creditworthiness, and willingness to work with us 
based on our analysis, as well as other lenders’ experience with 

the guarantor. Our assessment of the guarantor’s credit strength 
is reflected in our loan risk ratings for such loans. The loan risk 
rating and accruing status are important factors in our allowance 
for credit losses methodology. 

In considering the accrual status of the loan, we evaluate the 

collateral and future cash flows, as well as the anticipated 
support of any repayment guarantor. In many cases, the strength 
of the guarantor provides sufficient assurance that full 
repayment of the loan is expected. When full and timely 
collection of the loan becomes uncertain, including the 
performance of the guarantor, we place the loan on nonaccrual 
status. As appropriate, we also charge the loan down in 
accordance with our charge-off policies, generally to the net 
realizable value of the collateral securing the loan, if any.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)  We generally subject CRE loans 
to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and 
collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to regulatory 
definitions of pass and criticized categories with criticized 
segmented among special mention, substandard, doubtful and 
loss categories. The CRE portfolio, which included $8.4 billion of 
non-U.S. CRE loans, totaled $141.8 billion, or 15% of total loans, 
at December 31, 2019, and consisted of $121.8 billion of 
mortgage loans and $19.9 billion of construction loans. 

Table 19 summarizes CRE loans by state and property type 

with the related nonaccrual totals. The portfolio is diversified 
both geographically and by property type. The largest 

Table 19:  CRE Loans by State and Property Type 

geographic concentrations of CRE loans are in California, New 
York, Florida and Texas, which combined represented 49% of the 
total CRE portfolio. By property type, the largest concentrations 
are office buildings at 26% and apartments at 17% of the 
portfolio. CRE nonaccrual loans totaled 0.43% of the CRE 
outstanding balance at both December 31, 2019, and 
December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, we had $3.8 billion 
of criticized CRE mortgage loans, compared with $4.5 billion at 
December 31, 2018, and $187 million of criticized CRE 
construction loans, compared with $289 million at December 31, 
2018.

NON-U.S. LOANS  Our classification of non-U.S. loans is based on 
whether the borrower’s primary address is outside of the United 
States. At December 31, 2019, non-U.S. loans totaled 
$80.5 billion, representing approximately 8% of our total 
consolidated loans outstanding, compared with $71.9 billion, or 
approximately 8% of total consolidated loans outstanding, at 
December 31, 2018. Non-U.S. loans were approximately 4% of 
our consolidated total assets at both December 31, 2019, and 
December 31, 2018. 

COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE  Our country risk monitoring process 
incorporates centralized monitoring of economic, political, social, 
legal, and transfer risks in countries where we do or plan to do 

business, along with frequent dialogue with our customers, 
counterparties and regulatory agencies. We establish exposure 
limits for each country through a centralized oversight process 
based on customer needs, and through consideration of the 
relevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures 
closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing 
conditions. 

We evaluate our individual country risk exposure based on 
our assessment of the borrower’s ability to repay, which gives 
consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as guarantees 
and collateral, and may be different from the reporting based on 
the borrower’s primary address. Our largest single country 
exposure outside the U.S. based on our assessment of risk at

December 31, 2019, was the United Kingdom, which totaled 
$31.6 billion, and included $8.0 billion of sovereign claims. Our 
United Kingdom sovereign claims arise predominantly from 
deposits we have placed with the Bank of England pursuant to 
regulatory requirements in support of our London branch. 

The United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union 

(Brexit) on January 31, 2020, and is currently subject to a 
transition period during which the terms and conditions of its 
exit are being negotiated. As the United Kingdom exits from the 
European Union, our primary goal is to continue to serve our 
existing clients in the United Kingdom and the European Union, 
as well as to continue to meet the needs of our domestic clients 
as they do business in those locations. We have an existing 
authorized bank in Ireland and an asset management entity in 
Luxembourg. Additionally, we established a broker dealer in 
France. We are in the process of leveraging these entities to 
continue to serve clients in the European Union and continue to 
take actions to update our business operations in the United 
Kingdom and European Union, including implementing new

Factors” section in this Report. 

Table 20 provides information regarding our top 20 
exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) and our Eurozone 
exposure, based on our assessment of risk, which gives 
consideration to the country of any guarantors and/or underlying 
collateral. With respect to Table 20: 
• 

Lending exposure includes outstanding loans, unfunded 
credit commitments, and deposits with non-U.S. banks. 
These balances are presented prior to the deduction of 
allowance for credit losses or collateral received under the 
terms of the credit agreements, if any. 
Securities exposure represents debt and equity securities of 
non-U.S. issuers. Long and short positions are netted, and 
net short positions are reflected as negative exposure. 
•  Derivatives and other exposure represents foreign exchange 
contracts, derivative contracts, securities resale agreements, 
and securities lending agreements.

The real estate 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio includes 

Real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans by state are 

presented in Table 22. Our real estate 1-4 family non-PCI 
mortgage loans to borrowers in California represented 13% of 
total loans at December 31, 2019, located predominantly within 
the larger metropolitan areas, with no single California 
metropolitan area consisting of more than 5% of total loans. We 
monitor changes in real estate values and underlying economic 
or market conditions for all geographic areas of our real estate 
1-4 family mortgage portfolios as part of our credit risk 
management process. Our underwriting and periodic review of 
loans and lines secured by residential real estate collateral 
includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home 
Price Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models 
(AVMs) to support property values. AVMs are computer-based 
tools used to estimate the market value of homes. AVMs are a 
lower-cost alternative to appraisals and support valuations of 
large numbers of properties in a short period of time using 
market comparables and price trends for local market areas. The 
primary risk associated with the use of AVMs is that the value of 
an individual property may vary significantly from the average 
for the market area. We have processes to periodically validate 
AVMs and specific risk management guidelines addressing the 
circumstances when AVMs may be used. AVMs are not allowed in 
real estate 1-4 family mortgage origination underwriting. Broker 
evaluations and enhanced desktop appraisal reports are allowed 
in junior lien originations and some first lien line of credit 
originations up to $250,000. An appraisal is required for all real 
estate 1-4 family mortgage commitments greater than 
$250,000. Additional information about appraisals, AVMs, and 
our policy for their use can be found in Note 6 (Loans and 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

some loans with adjustable-rate features and some with an 
interest-only feature as part of the loan terms. Interest-only 
loans were approximately 3% and 4% of total loans at 
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We believe we have 
manageable adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) reset risk across 
our mortgage loan portfolios. We do not offer option ARM 
products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with 
fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to within the 
financial services industry as negative amortizing mortgage 
loans. The option ARMs we do have are included in the Pick-a-
Pay portfolio which was acquired from Wachovia. For more 
information, see the “Pick-a-Pay Portfolio” section in this Report. 
We continue to modify real estate 1-4 family mortgage 

loans to assist homeowners and other borrowers experiencing 
financial difficulties. Loans are generally underwritten at the time 
of the modification in accordance with underwriting guidelines 
established for our loan modification programs. Under these 
programs, we may provide concessions such as interest rate 
reductions, forbearance of principal, and in some cases, principal 
forgiveness. These programs generally include trial payment 
periods of three to four months, and after successful completion 
and compliance with terms during this period, the loan is 
permanently modified. Loans included under these programs are 
accounted for as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) at the start 
of a trial period or at the time of permanent modification, if no 
trial period is used. See the “Critical Accounting Policies – 
Allowance for Credit Losses” section in this Report for discussion 
on how we determine the allowance for credit losses attributable 
to our modified residential real estate portfolios. 

Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, 
current FICO scores and loan/combined loan to collateral values 
(LTV/CLTV) on the entire real estate 1-4 family mortgage loan 
portfolio. These credit risk indicators on the non-PCI mortgage 
portfolio exclude government insured/guaranteed loans. Loans 
30 days or more delinquent at December 31, 2019, totaled 
$3.0 billion, or 1% of total non-PCI mortgages, compared with 
$4.0 billion, or 1%, at December 31, 2018. Loans with FICO 
scores lower than 640 totaled $7.6 billion, or 2% of total non-PCI 
mortgages at December 31, 2019, compared with $9.7 billion, or 
3%, at December 31, 2018. Mortgages with a LTV/CLTV greater 
than 100% totaled $2.5 billion at December 31, 2019, or 1% of 
total non-PCI mortgages, compared with $3.9 billion, or 1%, at 
December 31, 2018. Information regarding credit quality 
indicators, including PCI credit quality indicators, can be found in 
Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial 
Statements in this Report.

Consists of 41 states; no state had loans in excess of $7.0 billion. 
Represents loans whose repayments are predominantly insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 

First Mortgage Portfolio  Our total real estate 1-4 family first 
lien mortgage portfolio (first mortgage) increased $8.8 billion in 
2019. Mortgage loan originations of $67.4 billion in 2019 were 
partially offset by paydowns and $4.0 billion of sales of PCI loans, 
predominantly Pick-a-Pay. Also, we purchased $3.3 billion of 
mortgage loans in 2019 as a result of exercising servicer cleanup 
calls. In addition, during 2019, we reclassified $1.9 billion of 
existing mortgage loans to MLHFS in anticipation of future 
whole loan sales. We also originated $3.4 billion of 
nonconforming mortgage loan originations as MLHFS in 2019, in 
anticipation of the issuance of residential mortgage-backed 
securities. 

The credit performance associated with our real estate 1-4 

family first mortgage portfolio remained strong in 2019, as 

Table 23:  First Mortgage Portfolio Performance 

measured through nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs. 
Nonaccrual loans decreased to $2.2 billion at December 31, 
2019, compared with $3.2 billion at December 31, 2018, driven 
by nonaccrual loan sales, the reclassification of nonaccrual loans 
to MLHFS in anticipation of future sales, and overall continued 
credit improvement. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average 
real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans was a net recovery of 
0.02% in 2019, compared with a net recovery of 0.03% in 2018.

Pick-a-Pay Portfolio  The Pick-a-Pay portfolio was one of the 
consumer residential mortgage portfolios we acquired from 
Wachovia. The Pick-a-Pay portfolio is included in consumer real 
estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans throughout this Report. 
Pick-a-Pay option payment loans may have fixed or adjustable 

rates with payment options that may include a minimum 
payment, an interest-only payment or fully amortizing payment 
(both 15- and 30-year options). Table 24 provides balances by

Adjusted unpaid principal balance includes write-downs taken on loans where severe delinquency (normally 180 days) or other indications of severe borrower financial stress exist that indicate there 
will be a loss of contractually due amounts upon final resolution of the loan. 

Our Pick-a-Pay portfolio included PCI loans with a carrying 

value of $519 million at December 31, 2019, compared with 
$4.9 billion at December 31, 2018. During 2019, we sold 
$4.0 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans that resulted in a gain of 
$1.6 billion. The accretable yield balance of our Pick-a-Pay PCI 
loan portfolio was $134 million ($229 million for all PCI loans) at 
December 31, 2019, compared with $2.8 billion ($3.0 billion for 
all PCI loans) at December 31, 2018. The decrease was 
predominantly due to Pick-a-Pay PCI loan sales. The estimated 
weighted-average life was approximately 5.1 years and 5.5 years 
at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The accretable 
yield percentage for Pick-a-Pay PCI loans for fourth quarter 
2019 was 11.69%.

Junior Lien Mortgage Portfolio  The junior lien mortgage 
portfolio consists of residential mortgage lines and loans that are 
subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. It 
is not unusual for these lines and loans to have draw periods, 
interest-only payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and 
similar features. Junior lien loan products are mostly amortizing 
payment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods 
between five to 30 years. 

We continuously monitor the credit performance of our 

junior lien mortgage portfolio for trends and factors that 
influence the frequency and severity of loss, such as junior lien 
mortgage performance when the first mortgage loan is 
delinquent. Table 25 shows certain delinquency and loss 
information for the junior lien mortgage portfolio and lists the 
top five states by outstanding balance. The decrease in 
outstanding balances since December 31, 2018, predominantly 

Table 25:  Junior Lien Mortgage Portfolio Performance 

reflected loan paydowns. As of December 31, 2019, 4% of the 
outstanding balance of the junior lien mortgage portfolio was 
associated with loans that had a combined loan to value (CLTV) 
ratio in excess of 100%. Of those junior lien mortgages with a 
CLTV ratio in excess of 100%, 3% were 30 days or more past due. 
CLTV means the ratio of the total loan balance of first mortgages 
and junior lien mortgages (including unused line amounts for 
credit line products) to property collateral value. The unsecured 
portion (the outstanding amount that was in excess of the most 
recent property collateral value) of the outstanding balances of 
these loans totaled 1% of the junior lien mortgage portfolio at 
December 31, 2019. For additional information on consumer 
loans by LTV/CLTV, see Table 6.12 in Note 6 (Loans and 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

Our junior lien, as well as first lien, lines of credit portfolios 
generally have draw periods of 10, 15 or 20 years with variable 
interest rate and payment options available during the draw 
period of (1) interest-only or (2) 1.5% of outstanding principal 
balance plus accrued interest. As of December 31, 2019, lines of 
credit in a draw period primarily used the interest-only option. 
During the draw period, the borrower has the option of 
converting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate 
to a fixed rate with terms including interest-only payments for a 
fixed period between three to seven years or a fully amortizing 
payment with a fixed period between five to 30 years. At the end 
of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an 
amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to 30 
years based on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines 
and loans have been structured with a balloon payment, which 
requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of 
the term period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully 
amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment 
increase, which can affect some borrowers’ ability to repay the 
outstanding balance. 

On a monthly basis, we monitor the payment characteristics 

of borrowers in our first and junior lien lines of credit portfolios. 
In December 2019, approximately 46% of these borrowers paid 
only the minimum amount due and approximately 51% paid 
more than the minimum amount due. The rest were either 

delinquent or paid less than the minimum amount due. For the 
borrowers with an interest-only payment feature, approximately 
30% paid only the minimum amount due and approximately 65% 
paid more than the minimum amount due. 

The lines that enter their amortization period may 

experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the 
ones in their draw or term period. We have considered this 
increased inherent risk in our allowance for credit loss estimate. 

In anticipation of our borrowers reaching the end of their 
contractual commitment, we have created a program to inform, 
educate and help these borrowers transition from interest-only 
to fully-amortizing payments or full repayment. We monitor the 
performance of the borrowers moving through the program in 
an effort to refine our ongoing program strategy. 

Table 26 reflects the outstanding balance of our portfolio of 
junior lien mortgages, including lines and loans, and first lien lines 
segregated into scheduled end of draw or end of term periods 
and products that are currently amortizing, or in balloon 
repayment status. At December 31, 2019, $488 million, or 2%, of 
lines in their draw period were 30 days or more past due, 
compared with $399 million, or 4%, of amortizing lines of credit. 
Included in the amortizing amounts in Table 26 is $46 million of 
end-of-term balloon payments which were past due. The 
unfunded credit commitments for junior and first lien lines 
totaled $58.9 billion at December 31, 2019.

Substantially all lines and loans are scheduled to convert to amortizing loans by the end of 2029, with annual scheduled amounts through 2029 ranging from $1.9 billion to $4.8 billion and averaging 
$3.2 billion per year. 

CREDIT CARDS  Our credit card portfolio totaled $41.0 billion at 
December 31, 2019, which represented 4% of our total 
outstanding loans. The net charge-off rate for our credit card 
portfolio was 3.53% for 2019, compared with 3.51% for 2018. 

AUTOMOBILE  Our automobile portfolio totaled $47.9 billion at 
December 31, 2019. The net charge-off rate for our automobile 
portfolio was 0.67% for 2019, compared with 1.21% for 2018. 
The decrease in the net charge-off rate for 2019, compared with 
2018, was driven by lower early losses on higher quality 
originations. 

OTHER REVOLVING CREDIT AND INSTALLMENT  Other revolving 
credit and installment loans totaled $34.3 billion at 
December 31, 2019, and largely included student and securities-
based loans. Our private student loan portfolio totaled 
$10.6 billion at December 31, 2019. The net charge-off rate for 
other revolving credit and installment loans was 1.59% for 2019, 
compared with 1.53% for 2018.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED 
ASSETS)  Table 27 summarizes nonperforming assets (NPAs) for 
each of the last five years. We generally place loans on nonaccrual 
status when: 
• 

the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes 
uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the 
borrower’s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, 
if any), such as in bankruptcy or other circumstances; 
they are 90 days (120 days with respect to real estate 1-4 
family mortgages) past due for interest or principal, unless 
both well-secured and in the process of collection; 
part of the principal balance has been charged off; or 
for junior lien mortgages, we have evidence that the related 
first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in the 
process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien 
delinquency status. 

• 

• 
• 

Credit card loans are not placed on nonaccrual status, but 
are generally fully charged off when the loan reaches 180 days 
past due. 

Table 27:  Nonperforming Assets (Nonaccrual Loans and Foreclosed Assets) 

Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Loans) 

to Financial Statements in this Report describes our accounting 
policy for nonaccrual and impaired loans and foreclosed assets. 
For additional information on impaired loans, see Note 6 (Loans 
and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Nonaccrual loans were $5.3 billion at December 31, 2019, 
down $1.2 billion from a year ago. Consumer nonaccrual loans 
were down $1.2 billion from a year ago predominantly due to a 
decrease in real estate 1-4 family mortgage nonaccrual loans, 
reflecting broad-based credit improvement, sales of nonaccrual 
mortgage loans, and the reclassification of nonaccrual mortgage 
loans to MLHFS. Commercial nonaccrual loans increased 
$66 million from a year ago, predominantly due to an increase in 
commercial and industrial nonaccrual loans, driven by a customer 
in the utilities industry, as well as increases in the oil, gas and 
pipeline portfolio, partially offset by credit improvement across 
various industry categories. Additionally, foreclosed assets 
decreased $148 million from December 31, 2018, driven by sales 
of commercial assets.

Real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA are not placed on nonaccrual status because they are insured or guaranteed. 
Financial information for periods prior to December 31, 2018, has been revised to exclude mortgage loans held for sale (MLHFS), loans held for sale (LHFS) and loans held at fair value of $390 million, 
$463 million, and $464 million at December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 
Excludes PCI loans because they continue to earn interest income from accretable yield, independent of performance in accordance with their contractual terms. 
Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate resulting from government insured/guaranteed loans are classified as nonperforming. Both principal and interest related to 
these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans were predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Receivables related to the foreclosure of certain government 
guaranteed real estate mortgage loans are excluded from this table and included in Accounts Receivable in Other Assets. For more information on the classification of certain government-
guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period 

represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status 
in accordance with our policy, offset by reductions for loans that 
are paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or are no longer 
classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and 
an improvement in the borrower’s financial condition and loan 
repayment capabilities. 

While nonaccrual loans are not free of loss content, we 

believe exposure to loss is significantly mitigated by the 
following factors at December 31, 2019: 
• 

86% of total commercial nonaccrual loans and 99% of total 
consumer nonaccrual loans are secured. Of the consumer 
nonaccrual loans, 95% are secured by real estate and 88% 
have a combined LTV (CLTV) ratio of 80% or less. 
losses of $360 million and $941 million have already been 
recognized on 19% of commercial nonaccrual loans and 35% 
of consumer nonaccrual loans, respectively, in accordance 
with our charge-off policies. Once we write down loans to 
the net realizable value (fair value of collateral less 
estimated costs to sell), we re-evaluate each loan regularly 
and record additional write-downs if needed. 
71% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on 
interest and 66% of commercial nonaccrual loans were 
current on both principal and interest. These commercial 
loans were on nonaccrual status because the full or timely 
collection of interest or principal had become uncertain.

of the $1.3 billion of consumer loans in bankruptcy or 
discharged in bankruptcy, and classified as nonaccrual, 
$916 million were current. 
the remaining risk of loss of all nonaccrual loans has been 
considered and we believe is adequately covered by the 
allowance for loan losses. 

We continue to work with our customers experiencing 
financial difficulty to determine if they can qualify for a loan 
modification so that they can stay in their homes. Under our 
proprietary modification programs, customers may be required 
to provide updated documentation, and some programs require 
completion of payment during trial periods to demonstrate 
sustained performance before the loan can be removed from 
nonaccrual status. 

If interest due on all nonaccrual loans (including loans that 

were, but are no longer on nonaccrual status at year end) had 
been accrued under the original terms, approximately 
$361 million of interest would have been recorded as income on 
these loans, compared with $316 million actually recorded as 
interest income in 2019, versus $446 million and $426 million, 
respectively, in 2018.

Foreclosed government insured/guaranteed loans are temporarily transferred to and held by us as servicer, until reimbursement is received from FHA or VA. 
Includes loans moved into foreclosed assets from nonaccrual status, PCI loans transitioned directly to foreclosed assets and repossessed automobiles. 

Foreclosed assets at December 31, 2019, included 

$222 million of foreclosed residential real estate, of which 23% is 
predominantly FHA insured or VA guaranteed and expected to 
have minimal or no loss content. The remaining amount of 
foreclosed assets has been written down to estimated net 
realizable value. Of the $303 million in foreclosed assets at 
December 31, 2019, 69% have been in the foreclosed assets 
portfolio one year or less.

Table 31 and Table 32 provide information regarding the 
recorded investment of loans modified in TDRs. The allowance 
for loan losses for TDRs was $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion at 
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 6 (Loans 
and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report for additional information regarding TDRs. In those 
situations where principal is forgiven, the entire amount of such 

forgiveness is immediately charged off. When we delay the 
timing on the repayment of a portion of principal (principal 
forbearance), we charge off the amount of forbearance if that 
amount is not considered fully collectible. 

Our nonaccrual policies are generally the same for all loan 

types when a restructuring is involved. We typically 

Wells Fargo & Company 

73 

  
  
Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

re-underwrite loans at the time of restructuring to determine 
whether there is sufficient evidence of sustained repayment 
capacity based on the borrower’s documented income, debt to 
income ratios, and other factors. Loans lacking sufficient 
evidence of sustained repayment capacity at the time of 
modification are charged down to the fair value of the collateral, 
if applicable. For an accruing loan that has been modified, if the 
borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous 
terms and the underwriting process shows the capacity to 
continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will 
generally remain in accruing status. Otherwise, the loan will be 
placed in nonaccrual status and may be returned to accruing 
status when the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of 
performance, generally six consecutive months of payments, or 
equivalent, inclusive of consecutive payments made prior to 

modification. Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual status, and 
a corresponding charge-off is recorded to the loan balance, when 
we believe that principal and interest contractually due under the 
modified agreement will not be collectible. 

Table 33 provides an analysis of the changes in TDRs. Loans 
modified more than once are reported as TDR inflows only in the 
period they are first modified. Other than resolutions such as 
foreclosures, sales and transfers to held for sale, we may remove 
loans held for investment from TDR classification, but only if 
they have been refinanced or restructured at market terms and 
qualify as a new loan. 

TDRs of $11.8 billion at December 31, 2019, decreased 
$3.7 billion from December 31, 2018, due to paydowns, as well 
as a reclassification of $1.7 billion in real estate 1-4 family first 
mortgage TDR loans to MLHFS.

LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING  Loans 90 
days or more past due are still accruing if they are (1) well-
secured and in the process of collection or (2) real estate 
1-4 family mortgage loans or consumer loans exempt under 
regulatory rules from being classified as nonaccrual until later 
delinquency, usually 120 days past due. PCI loans are not 
included in past due and still accruing loans even when they are 
90 days or more contractually past due. These PCI loans are 
considered to be accruing because they continue to earn interest 
from accretable yield, independent of performance in accordance 
with their contractual terms. 

Excluding insured/guaranteed loans, loans 90 days or more 

past due and still accruing at December 31, 2019, were down 

$46 million, or 5%, from December 31, 2018, due to payments, 
other loss mitigation activities, and credit stabilization. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing whose 

repayments are predominantly insured by the FHA or 
guaranteed by the VA for mortgages were $6.4 billion at 
December 31, 2019, down from $7.7 billion at December 31, 
2018, due to an improvement in delinquencies, as well as a 
reduction in the portfolio. 

Table 34 reflects non-PCI loans 90 days or more past due 

and still accruing by class for loans not government insured/ 
guaranteed. For additional information on delinquencies by loan 
class, see Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to

Financial information for periods prior to December 31, 2018, has been revised to exclude MLHFS, LHFS and loans held at fair value, which reduced “Total, not government insured/guaranteed” by 
$6 million, $5 million and $4 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
PCI loans totaled $102 million, $370 million, $1.4 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Represents loans whose repayments are predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. 
Represents loans whose repayments are largely guaranteed by agencies on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). All remaining

(1)  Quarterly net charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of average respective loans are annualized. 

Table 35 presents net charge-offs for the four quarters and full 
year of 2019 and 2018. Net charge-offs in 2019 were $2.8 billion 
(0.29% of average total loans outstanding), compared with 
$2.7 billion (0.29%) in 2018. 

The increase in commercial and industrial net charge-offs in 
2019 was driven by lower recoveries, and higher losses in our oil 
and gas portfolio. The decrease in consumer net charge-offs in 
2019 was driven by lower losses, predominantly in the 
automobile portfolio, partially offset by a slight increase in losses 
in the credit card portfolio. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  The allowance for credit losses, 
which consists of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance 
for unfunded credit commitments, is management’s estimate of 
credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit 
commitments at the balance sheet date, excluding loans carried 
at fair value. The detail of the changes in the allowance for credit 
losses by portfolio segment (including charge-offs and 
recoveries by loan class) is in Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for 
Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

We apply a disciplined process and methodology to establish 

our allowance for credit losses each quarter. This process takes 
into consideration many factors, including historical and 
forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and loan 

grade-specific characteristics. The process involves subjective 
and complex judgments. In addition, we review a variety of credit 
metrics and trends. These credit metrics and trends, however, do 
not solely determine the amount of the allowance for credit 
losses as we use several analytical tools. Our estimation approach 
for the commercial portfolio reflects the estimated probability of 
default in accordance with the borrower’s financial strength, and 
the severity of loss in the event of default, considering the 
quality of any underlying collateral. Probability of default and 
severity at the time of default are statistically derived through 
historical observations of defaults and losses after default within 
each credit risk rating. Our estimation approach for the

In addition to the allowance for credit losses, there was 

$387 million at December 31, 2019, and $480 million at 
December 31, 2018, of nonaccretable difference to absorb 
losses on PCI loans of $568 million at December 31, 2019, and 
$5.0 billion at December 31, 2018. The allowance for credit 
losses is lower than otherwise would have been required without 
PCI loan accounting. As a result of PCI loans, certain ratios of the 
Company may not be directly comparable with credit-related 
metrics for other financial institutions. For additional 
information on PCI loans, see the “Risk Management – Credit 
Risk Management – Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans” section, 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 6 
(Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total 
nonaccrual loans may fluctuate significantly from period to 
period due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the 
portfolio, borrower credit strength and the value and 
marketability of collateral. 

The allowance for credit losses decreased $251 million, or 

2%, in 2019, due to improvement in the credit quality of our 
commercial and residential real estate portfolios, partially offset 
by an increase in the allowance for the credit card portfolio 
reflecting increased volume and a shift in portfolio mix. Total 

provision for credit losses was $2.7 billion in 2019 and 
$1.7 billion in 2018. The provision for credit losses was 
$75 million less than net charge-offs in 2019, reflecting the 
same changes mentioned above for the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with $1.0 billion less than net charge-offs in 
2018. For a discussion of our 2018 provision for credit losses 
compared with 2017, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Allowance for Credit Losses” section of our 
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 
2018. 

We believe the allowance for credit losses of $10.5 billion at 

December 31, 2019, was appropriate to cover credit losses 
inherent in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit 
commitments, at that date. The entire allowance for credit losses 
is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan 
portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is subject to change and 
reflects existing factors as of the date of determination, 
including economic or market conditions and ongoing internal 
and external examination processes. Due to the sensitivity of the 
allowance for credit losses to changes in the economic and 
business environment, it is possible that we will incur incremental 
credit losses not anticipated as of the balance sheet date. Future 
amounts of the allowance for credit losses will be based on a 
variety of factors, including loan growth, portfolio performance

and general economic conditions. Our process for determining 
the allowance for credit losses is discussed in the “Critical 
Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” section and 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

LIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE LOSSES  We sell 
residential mortgage loans to various parties, including (1) 
government-sponsored entities (GSEs) Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal National Mortgage 
Association (FNMA) who include the mortgage loans in GSE-
guaranteed mortgage securitizations, (2) SPEs that issue private 
label MBS, and (3) other financial institutions that purchase 
mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. In 
addition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgage 
loans that are then used to back securities guaranteed by the 
Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). We may be 
required to repurchase these mortgage loans, indemnify the 
securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the 
securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred 
on loans (collectively, repurchase) in the event of a breach of 
contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied 
within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of 
the breach. 

In connection with our sales and securitization of residential 

mortgage loans to various parties, we have established a 
mortgage repurchase liability, initially at fair value, related to 
various representations and warranties that reflect 
management’s estimate of losses for loans for which we could 
have a repurchase obligation, whether or not we currently service 
those loans, based on a combination of factors. Our mortgage 
repurchase liability estimation process also incorporates a 
forecast of repurchase demands associated with mortgage 
insurance rescission activity. 

Customary with industry practice, we have the right of 

recourse against correspondent lenders from whom we have 
purchased loans with respect to representations and warranties. 
Historical recovery rates as well as projected lender performance 
are incorporated in the establishment of our mortgage 
repurchase liability. 

We do not typically receive repurchase requests from 

GNMA, FHA and the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) or VA. As an originator of an FHA-insured or 
VA-guaranteed loan, we are responsible for obtaining the 
insurance with the FHA or the guarantee with the VA. To the 
extent we are not able to obtain the insurance or the guarantee 
we must request permission to repurchase the loan from the 
GNMA pool. Such repurchases from GNMA pools typically 
represent a self-initiated process upon discovery of the 
uninsurable loan (usually within 180 days from funding of the 
loan). Alternatively, in lieu of repurchasing loans from GNMA 
pools, we may be asked by FHA/HUD or the VA to indemnify 
them (as applicable) for defects found in the Post Endorsement 
Technical Review process or audits performed by FHA/HUD or 
the VA. The Post Endorsement Technical Review is a process 
whereby HUD performs underwriting audits of closed/insured 
FHA loans for potential deficiencies. Our liability for mortgage 
loan repurchase losses incorporates probable losses associated 
with such indemnification. 

RISKS RELATING TO SERVICING ACTIVITIES  In addition to servicing 
loans in our portfolio, we act as servicer and/or master servicer of 
residential mortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed 
mortgage securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage 
securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and 

private label mortgage securitizations, as well as for 
unsecuritized loans owned by institutional investors. The 
following discussion summarizes the primary duties and 
requirements of servicing and related industry developments. 
The loans we service were originated by us or by other 
mortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are 
typically to (1) collect payments due from borrowers, (2) 
advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest on 
the mortgage loans, (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title 
or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage 
loans, (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of 
taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments, (5) 
foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent 
consistent with the related servicing agreement, consider 
alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short 
sales, and (6) for loans sold into private label securitizations, 
manage the foreclosed property through liquidation. As master 
servicer, our primary duties are typically to (1) supervise, monitor 
and oversee the servicing of the mortgage loans by the servicer, 
(2) consult with each servicer and use reasonable efforts to cause 
the servicer to observe its servicing obligations, (3) prepare 
monthly distribution statements to security holders and, if 
required by the securitization documents, certain periodic 
reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC), (4) if required by the securitization 
documents, calculate distributions and loss allocations on the 
mortgage-backed securities, (5) prepare tax and information 
returns of the securitization trust, and (6) advance amounts 
required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform their 
advancing obligations. 

Each agreement under which we act as servicer or master 

servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for 
actions we take in such capacity and provides protection against 
expenses and liabilities we incur when acting in compliance with 
the specified standard. For example, private label securitization 
agreements under which we act as servicer or master servicer 
typically provide that the servicer and the master servicer are 
entitled to indemnification by the securitization trust for taking 
action or refraining from taking action in good faith or for errors 
in judgment. However, we are not indemnified, but rather are 
required to indemnify the securitization trustee, against any 
failure by us, as servicer or master servicer, to perform our 
servicing obligations or against any of our acts or omissions that 
involve willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the 
performance of, or reckless disregard of, our duties. In addition, if 
we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer or 
master servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is 
not cured within a specified period following notice, which can 
generally be given by the securitization trustee or a specified 
percentage of security holders. Whole loan sale contracts under 
which we act as servicer generally include similar provisions with 
respect to our actions as servicer. The standards governing 
servicing in GSE-guaranteed securitizations, and the possible 
remedies for violations of such standards, vary, and those 
standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides 
maintained by the GSEs, contracts between the GSEs and 
individual servicers and topical guides published by the GSEs 
from time to time. Such remedies could include indemnification 
or repurchase of an affected mortgage loan. In addition, in 
connection with our servicing activities, we could become subject 
to consent orders and settlement agreements with federal and 
state regulators for alleged servicing issues and practices. In 
general, these can require us to provide customers with loan 
modification relief, refinancing relief, and foreclosure prevention 

78 

Wells Fargo & Company 

  
and assistance, as well as can impose certain monetary penalties 
on us. 

Asset/Liability Management 
Asset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and 
managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. 
Primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides 
with the Finance Committee of our Board, which oversees the 
administration and effectiveness of financial risk management 
policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks. 
Primary oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the Risk 
Committee of the Board. At the management level, we utilize a 
Corporate Asset/Liability Committee (Corporate ALCO), which 
consists of management from finance, risk and business groups, 
to oversee these risks and provide periodic reports to the Board’s 
Finance Committee and Risk Committee as appropriate. As 
discussed in more detail for market risk activities below, we 
employ separate management level oversight specific to market 
risk. 

INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk, which potentially can have 
a significant earnings impact, is an integral part of being a 
financial intermediary. We are subject to interest rate risk 
because: 
• 

assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different 
times (for example, if assets reprice faster than liabilities and 
interest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially 
increase); 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by 
different amounts (for example, when the general level of 
interest rates is rising, we may increase rates paid on 
checking and savings deposit accounts by an amount that is 
less than the general rise in market interest rates); 
short-term and long-term market interest rates may change 
by different amounts (for example, the shape of the yield 
curve may affect new loan yields and funding costs 
differently); 
the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may 
shorten or lengthen as interest rates change (for example, if 
long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, MBS 
held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down slower 
than anticipated, which could impact portfolio income); or 
interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on 
loan demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage 
origination volume, the fair value of MSRs and other 
financial instruments, the value of the pension liability and 
other items affecting earnings.

and higher interest rates. Measured impacts from standardized 
ramps (gradual changes) and shocks (instantaneous changes) are 
summarized in Table 37, indicating net interest income 
sensitivity relative to the Company’s base net interest income 
plan. Ramp scenarios assume interest rates move gradually in 
parallel across the yield curve relative to the base scenario in year 
one, and the full amount of the ramp is held as a constant 
differential to the base scenario in year two. The following 
describes the simulation assumptions for the scenarios 
presented in Table 37: 
• 

Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated growth 
across assets and liabilities. 

•  Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated 
with the changes in interest rates are held constant. 
•  Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary 

across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or 
lower interest rates. 

•  Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix 

changes consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. 
Deposit mix is modeled to be the same as in the base 
scenario across the alternative scenarios. In higher interest 
rate scenarios, customer activity that shifts balances into 
higher-yielding products could reduce expected net interest 
income. 

•  We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities 

portfolios constant across scenarios.

various net interest income simulations using many interest rate 
scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the 
degree of change over time, the speed of change and the 
projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require 
assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet 
composition such as loan originations, prepayment speeds on 
loans and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing 
strategies. 

Currently, our profile is such that we project net interest 

income will benefit modestly from higher interest rates as our 
assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our 
liabilities, while in the case of lower interest rates, our assets 
would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our 
liabilities. 

Our most recent simulations estimate net interest income 
sensitivity over the next two years under a range of both lower 

(1) 

U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury Rate 

The sensitivity results above do not capture interest rate 
sensitive noninterest income and expense impacts. Our interest 
rate sensitive noninterest income and expense is predominantly 
driven by mortgage banking activities, and may move in the 
opposite direction of our net interest income. Mortgage 
originations generally decline in response to higher interest rates 
and generally increase, particularly refinancing activity, in 
response to lower interest rates. Mortgage results are also 
impacted by the valuation of MSRs and related hedge positions. 
See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – 
Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in this 
Report for more information. 

Interest rate sensitive noninterest income also results from 
changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits that 

Wells Fargo & Company 

79 

  
Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

reduce treasury management deposit service fees. Additionally, 
for the trading portfolio, our trading assets are (before the 
effects of certain economic hedges) generally less sensitive to 
changes in interest rates than the related funding liabilities. As a 
result, net interest income from the trading portfolio contracts 
and expands as interest rates rise and fall, respectively. The 
impact to net interest income does not include the fair value 
changes of trading securities and loans, which, along with the 
effects of related economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest 
income. 

We use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded 
and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to hedge 
our interest rate exposures. See the “Balance Sheet Analysis – 
Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities” section 
in this Report for more information on the use of the available-
for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios. The notional 
or contractual amount, credit risk amount and fair value of the 
derivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures as of 
December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, are presented in 
Note 18 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. We 
use derivatives for asset/liability management in two main ways: 
to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability 
• 
instruments/portfolios including investments, commercial 
loans and long-term debt, from fixed-rate payments to 
floating-rate payments, or vice versa; and 
to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, 
funded mortgage loans and MSRs using interest rate swaps, 
swaptions, futures, forwards and options. 

• 

MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK  We 
originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to 
various risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate risks. 
Based on market conditions and other factors, we reduce credit 
and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a majority of the long-
term fixed-rate mortgage and ARM loans we originate. On the 
other hand, we may hold originated ARMs and fixed-rate 
mortgage loans in our loan portfolio as an investment for our 
deposits. We determine whether the loans will be held for 
investment or held for sale at the time of commitment. We may 
subsequently change our intent to hold loans for investment and 
sell some or all of our ARMs or fixed-rate mortgages as part of 
our corporate asset/liability management. We may also acquire 
and add to our securities available for sale a portion of the 
securities issued at the time we securitize MLHFS. 

Interest rate and market risk can be substantial in the 
mortgage business. Changes in interest rates may potentially 
reduce total origination and servicing fees, the value of our 
residential MSRs measured at fair value, the value of MLHFS and 
the associated income and loss reflected in mortgage banking 
noninterest income, the income and expense associated with 
instruments (economic hedges) used to hedge changes in the 
fair value of MSRs and MLHFS, and the value of derivative loan 
commitments (interest rate “locks”) extended to mortgage 
applicants. 

Interest rates affect the amount and timing of origination 

and servicing fees because consumer demand for new 
mortgages and the level of refinancing activity are sensitive to 
changes in mortgage interest rates. Typically, a decline in 
mortgage interest rates will lead to an increase in mortgage 
originations and fees and may also lead to an increase in servicing 
fee income, depending on the level of new loans added to the 
servicing portfolio and prepayments. Given the time it takes for 
consumer behavior to fully react to interest rate changes, as well 
as the time required for processing a new application, providing 
the commitment, and securitizing and selling the loan, interest 

rate changes will affect origination and servicing fees with a lag. 
The amount and timing of the impact on origination and 
servicing fees will depend on the magnitude, speed and duration 
of the change in interest rates. 

We measure originations of MLHFS at fair value where an 
active secondary market and readily available market prices exist 
to reliably support fair value pricing models used for these loans. 
Loan origination fees on these loans are recorded when earned, 
and related direct loan origination costs are recognized when 
incurred. We also measure at fair value certain of our other 
interests held related to residential loan sales and securitizations. 
We believe fair value measurement for MLHFS and other 
interests held, which we hedge with free-standing derivatives 
(economic hedges) along with our MSRs measured at fair value, 
reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes 
in the value of these assets with changes in the value of 
derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets. During 
2017, 2018, and 2019, in response to continued secondary 
market illiquidity, as well as our desire to retain high-quality loans 
on our balance sheet, we continued to originate certain prime 
non-agency loans to be substantially held for investment. We did 
however designate a small portion of our non-agency 
originations in 2018 and 2019 to MLHFS in support of future 
issuances of private label residential mortgage backed securities 
(RMBS). We issued $2.4 billion and $441 million of RMBS in 2019 
and 2018, respectively. 

We initially measure all of our MSRs at fair value and carry 
substantially all of them at fair value depending on our strategy 
for managing interest rate risk. Under this method, the MSRs are 
recorded at fair value at the time we sell or securitize the related 
mortgage loans. The carrying value of MSRs carried at fair value 
reflects changes in fair value at the end of each quarter and 
changes are included in net servicing income, a component of 
mortgage banking noninterest income. If the fair value of the 
MSRs increases, income is recognized; if the fair value of the 
MSRs decreases, a loss is recognized. We use a dynamic and 
sophisticated model to estimate the fair value of our MSRs and 
periodically benchmark our estimates to independent appraisals. 
The valuation of MSRs can be highly subjective and involve 
complex judgments by management about matters that are 
inherently unpredictable. See “Critical Accounting Policies – 
Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights” section in 
this Report for additional information. Changes in interest rates 
influence a variety of significant assumptions included in the 
periodic valuation of MSRs, including prepayment speeds, 
expected returns and potential risks on the servicing asset 
portfolio, costs to service, the value of escrow balances and other 
servicing valuation elements. For key economic assumptions and 
the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see Table 10.6 in 
Note 10 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

An increase in interest rates generally reduces the 

propensity for refinancing, extends the expected duration of the 
servicing portfolio and, therefore, increases the estimated fair 
value of the MSRs. However, an increase in interest rates can also 
reduce mortgage loan demand and, therefore, reduce origination 
income. A decline in interest rates generally increases the 
propensity for refinancing, reduces the expected duration of the 
servicing portfolio and therefore reduces the estimated fair value 
of MSRs. This reduction in fair value causes a charge to income 
for MSRs carried at fair value, net of any gains on free-standing 
derivatives (economic hedges) used to hedge MSRs. We may 
choose not to fully hedge the entire potential decline in the value 
of our MSRs resulting from a decline in interest rates because 

80 

Wells Fargo & Company 

 
the potential increase in origination/servicing fees in that 
scenario provides a partial “natural business hedge.” 

The price risk associated with our MSRs is economically 
hedged with a combination of highly liquid interest rate forward 
instruments including mortgage forward contracts, interest rate 
swaps and interest rate options. All of the instruments included 
in the hedge are marked to fair value daily. Because the hedging 
instruments are traded in predominantly highly liquid markets, 
their prices are readily observable and are fully reflected in each 
quarter’s mark to market. Quarterly MSR hedging results include 
a combination of directional gain or loss due to market changes 
as well as any carry income generated. If the economic hedge is 
effective, its overall directional hedge gain or loss will offset the 
change in the valuation of the underlying MSR asset. Gains or 
losses associated with these economic hedges are included in 
mortgage banking noninterest income. Consistent with our 
longstanding approach to hedging interest rate risk in the 
mortgage business, the size of the hedge and the particular 
combination of forward hedging instruments at any point in time 
is designed to reduce the volatility of the mortgage business’s 
earnings over various time frames within a range of mortgage 
interest rates. Because market factors, the composition of the 
mortgage servicing portfolio and the relationship between the 
origination and servicing sides of our mortgage business change 
continually, the types of instruments used in our hedging are 
reviewed daily and rebalanced based on our evaluation of current 
market factors and the interest rate risk inherent in our MSRs 
portfolio. Throughout 2019, our economic hedging strategy 
primarily used forward mortgage purchase contracts that were 
effective at offsetting the impact of interest rates on the value 
of the MSR asset. 

Mortgage forward contracts are designed to pass the full 
economics of the underlying reference mortgage securities to 
the holder of the contract, including both the directional gain and 
loss from the forward delivery of the reference securities and the 
corresponding carry income. Carry income represents the 
contract’s price accretion from the forward delivery price to the 
spot price including both the yield earned on the reference 
securities and the market implied cost of financing during the 
period. The actual amount of carry income earned on the hedge 
each quarter will depend on the amount of the underlying asset 
that is hedged and the particular instruments included in the 
hedge. The level of carry income is driven by the slope of the yield 
curve and other market driven supply and demand factors 
affecting the specific reference securities. A steep yield curve 
generally produces higher carry income while a flat or inverted 
yield curve can result in lower or potentially negative carry 
income. The level of carry income is also affected by the type of 
instrument used. In general, mortgage forward contracts tend to 
produce higher carry income than interest rate swap contracts. 
Carry income is recognized over the life of the mortgage forward 
as a component of the contract’s mark to market gain or loss. 
Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in 

mortgage banking is a complex process that requires 
sophisticated modeling and constant monitoring. While we 
attempt to balance these various aspects of the mortgage 
business, there are several potential risks to earnings: 
• 

Valuation changes for MSRs associated with interest rate 
changes are recorded in earnings immediately within the 
accounting period in which those interest rate changes 
occur, whereas the impact of those same changes in interest 
rates on origination and servicing fees occur with a lag and 
over time. Thus, the mortgage business could be protected 
from adverse changes in interest rates over a period of time 

• 

on a cumulative basis but still display large variations in 
income from one accounting period to the next. 
The degree to which our net gains on loan originations 
offsets valuation changes for MSRs is imperfect, varies at 
different points in the interest rate cycle, and depends not 
just on the direction of interest rates but on the pattern of 
quarterly interest rate changes. 

•  Origination volumes, the valuation of MSRs and hedging 
results and associated costs are also affected by many 
factors. Such factors include the mix of new business 
between ARMs and fixed-rate mortgages, the relationship 
between short-term and long-term interest rates, the 
degree of volatility in interest rates, the relationship 
between mortgage interest rates and other interest rate 
markets, and other interest rate factors. Additional factors 
that can impact the valuation of the MSRs include changes 
in servicing and foreclosure costs due to changes in investor 
or regulatory guidelines, as well as individual state 
foreclosure legislation, and changes in discount rates due to 
market participants requiring a higher return due to updated 
market expectations on costs and risks associated with 
investing in MSRs. Many of these factors are hard to predict 
and we may not be able to directly or perfectly hedge their 
effect. 

•  While our hedging activities are designed to balance our 
mortgage banking interest rate risks, the financial 
instruments we use may not perfectly correlate with the 
values and income being hedged. For example, the change in 
the value of ARM production held for sale from changes in 
mortgage interest rates may or may not be fully offset by 
index-based financial instruments used as economic hedges 
for such ARMs. Hedge results may also be impacted as the 
overall level of hedges changes as interest rates change, or 
as there are other changes in the market for mortgage 
forwards that may affect the implied carry on the MSRs. For 
example, the hedge-carry income on our economic hedges 
for the MSRs did not continue at levels consistent with 2018 
as the flat to inverted yield curve resulted in negative hedge 
carry in 2019. 

The total carrying value of our residential and commercial 

MSRs was $12.9 billion and $16.1 billion at December 31, 2019 
and 2018, respectively. The weighted-average note rate on our 
portfolio of loans serviced for others was 4.25% and 4.32% at 
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The carrying value of 
our total MSRs represented 0.79% and 0.94% of mortgage loans 
serviced for others at December 31, 2019 and 2018, 
respectively. 

As part of our mortgage banking activities, we enter into 
commitments to fund residential mortgage loans at specified 
times in the future. A mortgage loan commitment can be either 
a floating rate commitment, where the interest rate is not yet 
determined, or it can be an interest rate lock that binds us to 
lend funds to a potential borrower at a specified interest rate and 
within a specified period of time, generally up to 60 days after 
inception of the rate lock. These loan commitments are 
derivative loan commitments if the loans that will result from the 
exercise of the commitments will be held for sale. These 
derivative loan commitments are recognized at fair value on the 
balance sheet with changes in their fair values recorded as part of 
mortgage banking noninterest income. The fair value of these 
commitments include, at inception and during the life of the loan 
commitment, the expected net future cash flows related to the 
associated servicing of the loan as part of the fair value 
measurement of derivative loan commitments. Changes 

Wells Fargo & Company 

81 

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

subsequent to inception are based on changes in fair value of the 
underlying loan resulting from the exercise of the commitment 
and changes in the probability that the loan will not fund within 
the terms of the commitment, referred to as a fall-out factor. 
The value of the underlying loan commitment is affected by 
changes in interest rates and the passage of time. 

Outstanding derivative loan commitments (interest rate 
“locks”) expose us to the risk that the price of the mortgage 
loans underlying the commitments might decline due to 
increases in mortgage interest rates from inception of the rate 
lock to the funding of the loan. To minimize this risk, we employ 
mortgage forwards and options and Eurodollar futures and 
options contracts as economic hedges against the potential 
decreases in the values of the loans. We expect that these 
derivative financial instruments will experience changes in fair 
value that will either fully or partially offset the changes in fair 
value of the derivative loan commitments. However, changes in 
investor demand, such as concerns about credit risk, can also 
cause changes in the spread relationships between underlying 
loan value and the derivative financial instruments that cannot 
be hedged. 

MARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss 
from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest 
rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and 
commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to 
counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, 
basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It also includes price risk in 
the trading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge 
effectiveness risk associated with the mortgage book, and 
impairment on private equity investments. 

The Board’s Finance Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for market risk and oversees the Company’s 
market risk exposure and market risk management strategies. In 
addition, the Board’s Risk Committee has certain oversight 
responsibilities with respect to market risk, including adjusting 
the Company’s market risk appetite with input from the Finance 
Committee. The Finance Committee also reports key market risk 
matters to the Risk Committee. 

At the management level, the Market and Counterparty Risk 

Management function, which is part of IRM, has primary 
oversight responsibility for market risk. The Market and 
Counterparty Risk Management function reports into the CRO 
and also provides periodic reports related to market risk to the 
Board’s Finance Committee. 

MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading 
activities to accommodate the investment and risk management 
activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to 
manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities 
predominantly occur within our Wholesale Banking businesses 
and to a lesser extent other divisions of the Company. Debt 
securities held for trading, equity securities held for trading, 
trading loans and trading derivatives are financial instruments 
used in our trading activities, and all are carried at fair value. 
Income earned on the financial instruments used in our trading 
activities include net interest income, changes in fair value and 
realized gains and losses. Net interest income earned from our 
trading activities is reflected in the interest income and interest 
expense components of our income statement. Changes in fair 
value of the financial instruments used in our trading activities 
are reflected in net gains on trading activities, a component of 
noninterest income in our income statement. For more 
information on the financial instruments used in our trading 
activities and the income from these trading activities, see 
Note 4 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to 
estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial 
markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with 
sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and 
monitoring market risk. These market risk measures are 
monitored at both the business unit level and at aggregated 
levels on a daily basis. Our corporate market risk management 
function aggregates and monitors all exposures to ensure risk 
measures are within our established risk appetite. Changes to the 
market risk profile are analyzed and reported on a daily basis. The 
Company monitors various market risk exposure measures from 
a variety of perspectives, including line of business, product, risk 
type, and legal entity. 

Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the 

market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The 
Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes 
to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. 
Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our 
balance sheet.

Wells Fargo & Company 

 Table 38 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk 

category. Our Trading General VaR uses a historical simulation 
model which assumes that historical changes in market values 
are representative of the potential future outcomes and 
measures the expected earnings loss of the Company over a       
1-day time interval at a 99% confidence level. Our historical 
simulation model is based on equally weighted data from a       
12-month historical look-back period. We believe using a          
12-month look-back period helps ensure the Company’s VaR is 

responsive to current market conditions. The 99% confidence 
level equates to an expectation that the Company would incur 
single-day trading losses in excess of the VaR estimate on 
average once every 100 trading days. 

Average Company Trading General VaR was $22 million for 
the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with $15 million 
for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in average 
Company Trading General VaR for the year ended December 31, 
2019, was mainly driven by changes in portfolio composition.

The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly 
correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may 
occur on different days. 

Sensitivity Analysis  Given the inherent limitations of the VaR 
models, the Company uses other measures, including sensitivity 
analysis, to measure and monitor risk. Sensitivity analysis is the 
measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a 0.01% 
increase in interest rates or a 1% increase in equity prices. We 
conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, credit spreads, 
volatility, equity, commodity, and foreign exchange exposure. 
Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication 
of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market 
moves. 

Stress Testing  While VaR captures the risk of loss due to adverse 
changes in markets using recent historical market data, stress 
testing is designed to capture the Company’s exposure to 
extreme but low probability market movements. Stress 
scenarios estimate the risk of losses based on management’s 
assumptions of abnormal but severe market movements such as 
severe credit spread widening or a large decline in equity prices. 
These scenarios assume that the market moves happen 
instantaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes 
place to mitigate losses as events unfold (a conservative 
approach since experience demonstrates otherwise). 

An inventory of scenarios is maintained representing both 

historical and hypothetical stress events that affect a broad 
range of market risk factors with varying degrees of correlation 
and differing time horizons. Hypothetical scenarios assess the 
impact of large movements in financial variables on portfolio 
values. Typical examples include a 1% (100 basis point) increase 
across the yield curve or a 10% decline in equity market indexes. 
Historical scenarios utilize an event-driven approach: the stress 
scenarios are based on plausible but rare events, and the analysis 
addresses how these events might affect the risk factors 
relevant to a portfolio. 

The Company’s stress testing framework is also used in 
calculating results in support of the Federal Reserve Board’s 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and internal 

stress tests. Stress scenarios are regularly reviewed and updated 
to address potential market events or concerns. For more detail 
on the CCAR process, see the “Capital Management” section in 
this Report. 

MARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES  We are directly and indirectly 
affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage 
direct investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth 
companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate 
recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that 
make similar private equity investments. These private equity 
investments are made within capital allocations approved by 
management and the Board. The Board’s policy is to review 
business developments, key risks and historical returns for the 
private equity investment portfolio at least annually. 
Management reviews these investments at least quarterly and 
assesses them for possible OTTI and observable price changes. 
For nonmarketable equity securities, the analysis is based on 
facts and circumstances of each individual investment and the 
expectations for that investment’s cash flows, capital needs, the 
viability of its business model, our exit strategy, and observable 
price changes that are similar to the investments held. 
Investments in nonmarketable equity securities include private 
equity investments accounted for under the equity method, fair 
value through net income, and the measurement alternative. 
In conjunction with the March 2008 initial public offering 

(IPO) of Visa, Inc. (Visa), we received approximately 20.7 million 
shares of Visa Class B common stock, the class which was 
apportioned to member banks of Visa at the time of the IPO. To 
manage our exposure to Visa and realize the value of the 
appreciated Visa shares, we incrementally sold these shares 
through a series of sales, thereby eliminating this position as of 
September 30, 2015. As part of these sales, we agreed to 
compensate the buyer for any additional contributions to a 
litigation settlement fund for the litigation matters associated 
with the Class B shares we sold. Our exposure to this retained

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

litigation risk has been updated quarterly and is reflected on our 
balance sheet. For additional information about the associated 
litigation matters, see the “Interchange Litigation” section in 
Note 17 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
As part of our business to support our customers, we trade 

public equities, listed/OTC equity derivatives and convertible 
bonds. We have parameters that govern these activities. We also 
have marketable equity securities that include investments 
relating to our venture capital activities. We manage these 
marketable equity securities within capital risk limits approved 
by management and the Board and monitored by Corporate 
ALCO and the Market Risk Committee. The fair value changes in 
these marketable equity securities are recognized in net income. 
For more information, see Note 8 (Equity Securities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect 

our net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under 
management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability 
to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock 
market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and 
other business activities. Each business line monitors and 
manages these indirect risks. 

LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING  The objective of effective liquidity 
management is to ensure that we can meet customer loan 
requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other 
cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating 
conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or 
market stress. To achieve this objective, the Board establishes 
liquidity guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to 
cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-
dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These 
guidelines are monitored on a monthly basis by the Corporate 
ALCO and on a quarterly basis by the Board. These guidelines are 
established and monitored for both the consolidated company 
and for the Parent on a stand-alone basis to ensure that the 
Parent is a source of strength for its regulated, deposit-taking 
banking subsidiaries. 

Liquidity Standards  We are subject to a rule, issued by the FRB, 
OCC and FDIC, that includes a quantitative liquidity requirement 
consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) established by 
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The rule 
requires banking institutions, such as Wells Fargo, to hold high-
quality liquid assets (HQLA), such as central bank reserves and 
government and corporate debt that can be converted easily and 
quickly into cash, in an amount equal to or greater than its 
projected net cash outflows during a 30-day stress period. The 
rule is applicable to the Company on a consolidated basis and to 
our insured depository institutions (IDIs) with total assets 
greater than $10 billion. In addition, rules issued by the FRB 

Table 40:  Primary Sources of Liquidity 

impose enhanced liquidity management standards on large bank 
holding companies (BHC) such as Wells Fargo. 

The FRB, OCC and FDIC have proposed a rule that would 
implement a stable funding requirement, the net stable funding 
ratio (NSFR), which would require large banking organizations, 
such as Wells Fargo, to maintain a sufficient amount of stable 
funding in relation to their assets, derivative exposures and 
commitments over a one-year horizon period. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio  As of December 31, 2019, the 
consolidated Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., were above 
the minimum LCR requirement of 100%, which is calculated as 
HQLA divided by projected net cash outflows, as each is defined 
under the LCR rule. Table 39 presents the Company’s quarterly 
average values for the daily-calculated LCR and its components 
calculated pursuant to the LCR rule requirements.

Liquidity Sources  We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, cash 
equivalents and unencumbered high-quality, liquid debt 
securities. These assets make up our primary sources of liquidity 
which are presented in Table 40. Our primary sources of liquidity 
are substantially the same in composition as HQLA under the 
LCR rule; however, our primary sources of liquidity will generally 
exceed HQLA calculated under the LCR rule due to the applicable 
haircuts to HQLA and the exclusion of excess HQLA at our 
subsidiary IDIs required under the LCR rule. 

Our cash is predominantly on deposit with the Federal 
Reserve. Debt securities included as part of our primary sources 
of liquidity are comprised of U.S. Treasury and federal agency 
debt, and mortgage-backed securities issued by federal agencies 
within our debt securities portfolio. We believe these debt 
securities provide quick sources of liquidity through sales or by 
pledging to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions. 
Some of these debt securities are within the held-to-maturity 
portion of our debt securities portfolio and as such are not 
intended for sale but may be pledged to obtain financing. Some 
of the legal entities within our consolidated group of companies 
are subject to various regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions 
that can limit the transferability of their funds. We believe we 
maintain adequate liquidity for these entities in consideration of 
such funds transfer restrictions.

In addition to our primary sources of liquidity shown in   
Table 40, liquidity is also available through the sale or financing of 
other debt securities including trading and/or available-for-sale 
debt securities, as well as through the sale, securitization or 
financing of loans, to the extent such debt securities and loans 
are not encumbered. In addition, other debt securities in our 
held-to-maturity portfolio, to the extent not encumbered, may 
be pledged to obtain financing. 

Deposits have historically provided a sizable source of 
relatively low-cost funds. Deposits were 137% of total loans at 
December 31, 2019, and 135% at December 31, 2018. 

Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-
term borrowings. Table 41 shows selected information for short-

Highest month-end balance in each of the last five quarters was in October, September, June, and February 2019, and December 2018. 

Long-Term Debt  We access domestic and international capital 
markets for long-term funding (generally greater than one year) 
through issuances of registered debt securities, private 
placements and asset-backed secured funding. We issue long-
term debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve 
cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity 
profile. Proceeds from securities issued were used for general 
corporate purposes, and, unless otherwise specified in the 
applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement, we expect the 
proceeds from securities issued in the future will be used for the 
same purposes. Depending on market conditions, we may 
purchase our outstanding debt securities from time to time in 
privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender 
offer, or otherwise. We issued $53.4 billion of long-term debt in 
2019 and $9.7 billion in January and February of 2020. For 
additional information, see Note 15 (Long-Term Debt) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Credit Ratings  Investors in the long-term capital markets, as 
well as other market participants, generally will consider, among 
other factors, a company’s debt rating in making investment 
decisions. Rating agencies base their ratings on many 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, 

Table 42:  Credit Ratings as of December 31, 2019 

Moody’s 

S&P Global Ratings 

Fitch Ratings, Inc. 

DBRS Morningstar 

liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of 
earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the 
probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support 
for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these 
factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, 
our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants. 

On October 21, 2019, DBRS Morningstar confirmed the 

Company’s ratings and maintained the stable trend for all 
ratings. On December 16, 2019, Fitch Ratings, Inc., affirmed the 
Company’s ratings and maintained the stable outlook for all 
ratings. Both the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., remain 
among the highest-rated financial firms in the United States. 

See the “Risk Factors” section in this Report for additional 
information regarding our credit ratings and the potential impact 
a credit rating downgrade would have on our liquidity and 
operations, as well as Note 18 (Derivatives) to Financial 
Statements in this Report for information regarding additional 
collateral and funding obligations required for certain derivative 
instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall below

coordinate an enterprise-wide process for managing outreach 
and communications with our customers, and (x) implement a 
process to escalate key risks. When assessing risks associated 
with the transition away from IBORs, the LTO is reviewing both 
orderly and disorderly transition scenarios. 

In an effort to mitigate the risks associated with a transition 
away from IBORs, the LTO is in the process of implementing the 
following initiatives: (i) compiling an enterprise contract 
inventory of IBOR-related terms, (ii) implementing more robust 
fallback language and disclosures related to LIBOR transition, (iii) 
developing a plan to amend legacy contracts to reference 
alternative reference rates, (iv) enhancing systems to support 
new fallback language and new products linked to alternative 
reference rates, (v) preparing internal and external 
communications regarding an IBOR transition, (vi) developing 
internal guidance focused on issues related to IBORs and 
alternative reference rate products, and (vii) evaluating policies 
and procedures in light of the transition away from LIBOR and 
other IBORs and the introduction of new products linked to 
alternative reference rates. 

In addition, the Company is actively working with regulators, 

industry working groups (such as the ARRC) and trade 
associations that are developing guidance to facilitate an orderly 
transition away from the use of LIBOR. We continue to assess 
the risks and related impacts associated with a transition away 
from IBORs. See the “Risk Factors” section in this Report for 
additional information regarding the potential impact of a 
benchmark rate, such as LIBOR, or other referenced financial 
metric being significantly changed, replaced, or discontinued. 
Although the Company did not issue any long-term debt 
with an interest rate indexed to the Secured Overnight Financing 
Rate (SOFR) in 2019, we did issue $1.0 billion of long-term debt 
indexed to SOFR in 2018. SOFR is published by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York as an alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR 
and is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight 
collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. 

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK MEMBERSHIP  The Federal Home 
Loan Banks (the FHLBs) are a group of cooperatives that lending 
institutions use to finance housing and economic development in 
local communities. We are a member of the FHLBs based in 
Dallas, Des Moines and San Francisco. Each member of the 
FHLBs is required to maintain a minimum investment in capital 
stock of the applicable FHLB. The board of directors of each 
FHLB can increase the minimum investment requirements in the 
event it has concluded that additional capital is required to allow 
it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase 
in the minimum investment requirements outside of specified 
ranges requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance 
Agency. Because the extent of any obligation to increase our 
investment in any of the FHLBs depends entirely upon the 
occurrence of a future event, potential future payments to the 
FHLBs are not determinable. 

LIBOR TRANSITION Due to uncertainty surrounding the suitability 
and sustainability of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), 
central banks and global regulators have called for financial 
market participants to prepare for the discontinuation of LIBOR 
by the end of 2021. LIBOR is a widely-referenced benchmark 
rate, which is published in five currencies and a range of tenors, 
and seeks to estimate the cost at which banks can borrow on an 
unsecured basis from other banks. We have a significant number 
of assets and liabilities referenced to LIBOR and other interbank 
offered rates (IBORs) such as commercial loans, adjustable-rate 
mortgage loans, derivatives, debt securities, and long-term debt. 
As of December 31, 2019, we had over $500 billion of assets, 
consisting mostly of commercial loans, over $80 billion of 
liabilities, and over $400 billion of off-balance sheet 
commitments linked to IBORs. These amounts exclude derivative 
assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of 
December 31, 2019, the notional amount of our IBOR-linked 
interest rate derivative contracts was over $10 trillion, of which 
over $8 trillion related to contracts with central counterparty 
clearinghouses. Each of the IBOR-linked amounts referenced 
above will vary in future periods as current contracts expire with 
potential replacement contracts using either IBOR or an 
alternative reference rate. As of December 31, 2019, U.S. dollar 
LIBOR represented substantially all of the IBOR-linked amounts 
referenced above; however, we had exposure to all primary 
IBORs. 

Accordingly, we established a LIBOR Transition Office (LTO) 
in February 2018, with senior management and Board oversight. 
The LTO is responsible for developing a coordinated strategy to 
transition the IBOR-linked contracts and processes across Wells 
Fargo to alternative reference rates and serves as primary 
conduit between Wells Fargo and relevant industry groups, such 
as the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC). Among 
other activities, the program structure created by the LTO is 
designed to (i) identify the types of exposures (e.g., products, 
systems, models) and risks associated with the transition, (ii) 
assess the provisions in our contracts that could apply in 
connection with the transition, (iii) incorporate more robust 
IBOR fallback language (contractual provisions that provide for 
transition to alternative reference rates upon defined trigger 
events) into new IBOR-linked product contracts, (iv) coordinate 
alternative reference rate product design, (v) appraise 
operational and infrastructure enhancements necessary to use 
alternative reference rates, (vi) facilitate systems and application 
revisions, including model development and validation, (vii) 
assess the funding issues, basis risk, and other finance, 
accounting, and tax impacts of transitioning away from IBORs, 
(viii) develop plans to minimize negative financial outcomes, (ix)

Capital Management 

We have an active program for managing capital through a 
comprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall 
capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an 
amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance 
objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market 
expectations. We primarily fund our working capital needs 
through the retention of earnings net of both dividends and 
share repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred 
stock and long and short-term debt. Retained earnings increased 
$8.5 billion from December 31, 2018, predominantly from 
Wells Fargo net income of $19.5 billion, less common and 
preferred stock dividends of $9.9 billion. During 2019, we issued 
48.8 million shares of common stock, excluding conversions of 
preferred shares. During 2019, we repurchased 502.4 million 
shares of common stock at a cost of $24.5 billion. The amount of 
our repurchases are subject to various factors as discussed in the 
“Securities Repurchases” section below. For additional 
information about share repurchases, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

In third quarter 2019, we redeemed $1.6 billion of our 
Preferred Stock, Series K. In January 2020, we issued $2.0 billion 
of our Preferred Stock, Series Z. In February 2020, we announced 
a redemption of the remaining outstanding shares of our 
Preferred Stock, Series K, and a partial redemption of our 
Preferred Stock, Series T. For more information, see Note 20 
(Preferred Stock) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Regulatory Capital Guidelines 
The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the 
FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital (RBC) guidelines establish a 
risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of 
assets and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. 

RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS The Company 
is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to 
implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking 
organizations. The federal banking regulators’ capital rules, 
among other things, require on a fully phased-in basis: 
• 

a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 9.00%, 
comprised of a 4.50% minimum requirement plus a capital 
conservation buffer of 2.50% and for us, as a global 
systemically important bank (G-SIB), a capital surcharge of 
2.00%; 
a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 10.50%, comprised of a 
6.00% minimum requirement plus the capital conservation 
buffer of 2.50% and the G-SIB capital surcharge of 2.00%; 
a minimum total capital ratio of 12.50%, comprised of a 
8.00% minimum requirement plus the capital conservation 
buffer of 2.50% and the G-SIB capital surcharge of 2.00%; 
a potential countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% to be 
added to the minimum capital ratios, which could be 
imposed by regulators at their discretion if it is determined 
that a period of excessive credit growth is contributing to 
an increase in systemic risk; and 
a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.00%. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

The Basel III capital requirements for calculating CET1 and 
tier 1 capital, along with risk-weighted assets (RWAs), are fully 
phased-in. However, the requirements for determining tier 2 
and total capital are still in accordance with Transition 
Requirements and are scheduled to be fully phased-in by the 
end of 2021. The Basel III capital rules contain two frameworks 
for calculating capital requirements, a Standardized Approach 
and an Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions, 
including Wells Fargo. Accordingly, in the assessment of our 
capital adequacy, we must report the lower of our CET1, tier 1 
and total capital ratios calculated under the Standardized 
Approach and under the Advanced Approach. 

On April 10, 2018, the FRB issued a proposed rule that 

would add a stress capital buffer and a stress leverage buffer 
to the minimum capital and tier 1 leverage ratio requirements. 
The buffers would be calculated based on the decrease in a 
financial institution’s risk-based capital and tier 1 leverage 
ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario in 
CCAR, plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends. 
The stress capital buffer would replace the 2.50% capital 
conservation buffer under the Standardized Approach, 
whereas the stress leverage buffer would be added to the 
current 4.00% minimum tier 1 leverage ratio. 

As a G-SIB, we are also subject to the FRB’s rule 
implementing the additional capital surcharge of between 
1.00-4.50% on the minimum capital requirements of G-SIBs. 
Under the rule, we must annually calculate our surcharge under 
two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. The first 
method (method one) considers our size, interconnectedness, 
cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and complexity, 
consistent with the methodology developed by the BCBS and the 
Financial Stability Board (FSB). The second (method two) uses 
similar inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-
term wholesale funding and will generally result in higher 
surcharges than the BCBS methodology. Because the G-SIB 
capital surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can 
differ over time, the amount of the surcharge is subject to 
change in future years. 

The tables that follow provide information about our risk-

based capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III 
capital guidelines. Although we continue to report certain capital 
amounts and ratios in accordance with Transition Requirements 
for banking industry regulatory reporting purposes, we are 
managing our capital on a fully phased-in basis. For information 
about our capital requirements calculated in accordance with 
Transition Requirements, see Note 29 (Regulatory and Agency 
Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at 
period end. 
Under the Advanced Approach, the allowance for credit losses that exceeds expected credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, to the extent the excess allowance does not exceed 0.60% of 
Advanced credit RWAs, and under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is includable in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of Standardized credit RWAs, with any excess allowance for 
credit losses being deducted from total RWAs. 
RWAs calculated under the Advanced Approach utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit models based upon our experience with internal rating grades. 
Advanced Approach also includes an operational risk component, which reflects the risk of operating loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems. 
Under the regulatory guidelines for risk-based capital, on-balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk 
categories according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with 
that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total RWAs.

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY  We also evaluate our business based 
on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible 
common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents 
total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, 
goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) 
and goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity 
securities, net of applicable deferred taxes. These tangible 
common equity ratios are as follows: 
• 

Tangible book value per common share, which represents 
tangible common equity divided by common shares 
outstanding; and 
Return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE), which 
represents our annualized earnings contribution as a 
percentage of tangible common equity. 

• 

The methodology of determining tangible common equity 

may differ among companies. Management believes that 
tangible book value per common share and return on average 
tangible common equity, which utilize tangible common equity, 
are useful financial measures because they enable investors and 
others to assess the Company’s use of equity. 

Table 47 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP 

financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

Capital Management (continued) 

SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO  As a BHC, we are required to 
maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of at least 5.00% 
(comprised of a 3.00% minimum requirement plus a 
supplementary leverage buffer of 2.00%) to avoid restrictions on 
capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our IDIs 
are required to maintain a SLR of at least 6.00% to be considered 
well-capitalized under applicable regulatory capital adequacy 
guidelines. In April 2018, the FRB and OCC proposed rules (the 
“Proposed SLR Rules”) that would replace the 2.00% 
supplementary leverage buffer with a buffer equal to one-half of 
our G-SIB capital surcharge. The Proposed SLR Rules would 
similarly tailor the current 6.00% SLR requirement for our IDIs. At 
December 31, 2019, our SLR for the Company was 7.07%, and 
we also exceeded the applicable SLR requirements for each of 
our IDIs. See Table 48 for information regarding the calculation 
and components of the SLR.

OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL MATTERS As a G-SIB, we are 
required to have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured 
long-term debt for purposes of resolvability and resiliency, often 
referred to as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). U.S. G-SIBs 
are required to have a minimum TLAC amount (consisting of 
CET1 capital and additional tier 1 capital issued directly by the 
top-tier or covered BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) 
equal to the greater of (i) 18.00% of RWAs and (ii) 7.50% of total 
leverage exposure (the denominator of the SLR calculation). 
Additionally, U.S. G-SIBs are required to maintain (i) a TLAC 
buffer equal to 2.50% of RWAs plus our applicable G-SIB capital 
surcharge calculated under method one plus any applicable 
countercyclical buffer to be added to the 18.00% minimum and 
(ii) an external TLAC leverage buffer equal to 2.00% of total 
leverage exposure to be added to the 7.50% minimum, in order 
to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary 
bonus payments. U.S. G-SIBs are also required to have a 
minimum amount of eligible unsecured long-term debt equal to 
the greater of (i) 6.00% of RWAs plus our applicable G-SIB capital 
surcharge calculated under method two and (ii) 4.50% of the 
total leverage exposure. Under the Proposed SLR Rules, the 
2.00% external TLAC leverage buffer would be replaced with a 
buffer equal to one-half of our applicable G-SIB capital 
surcharge, and the leverage component for calculating the 
minimum amount of eligible unsecured long-term debt would be 

modified from 4.50% of total leverage exposure to 2.50% of total 
leverage exposure plus one-half of our applicable G-SIB capital 
surcharge. As of December 31, 2019, our eligible external TLAC 
as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 23.28% 
compared with a required minimum of 22.00%. Similar to the 
risk-based capital requirements, we determine minimum 
required TLAC based on the greater of RWAs determined under 
the Standardized and Advanced approaches. 

In addition, as discussed in the “Risk Management – Asset/ 

Liability Management – Liquidity and Funding – Liquidity 
Standards” section in this Report, federal banking regulators 
have issued a final rule regarding the U.S. implementation of the 
Basel III LCR and a proposed rule regarding the NSFR. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing 
Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet 
regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-
term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow 
our business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying 
environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return 
capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital 
structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital 
requirements including the G-SIB capital surcharge. Accordingly, 
based on the final Basel III capital rules under the lower of the 
Standardized or Advanced Approaches CET1 capital ratios, we 
currently target a long-term CET1 capital ratio at or in excess of 
10.00%, which includes a 2.00% G-SIB capital surcharge. Our 
capital targets are subject to change based on various factors, 
including changes to the regulatory capital framework and 
expectations for large banks promulgated by bank regulatory 
agencies, planned capital actions, changes in our risk profile and 
other factors. As discussed above in the “Capital Management – 
Regulatory Capital Guidelines – Risk-Based Capital and Risk-
Weighted Assets” section of this Report, the FRB has proposed 
including a stress capital buffer to replace the current 2.50% 
capital conservation buffer. Under the proposal, it is expected 
that the adoption of current expected credit loss (CECL) 
accounting would be included in the calculation of the stress 
capital buffer. We expect that implementation of the stress 
capital buffer may increase the level and volatility of minimum 
capital ratio requirements, which may cause our current long-
term CET1 capital ratio target of 10.00% to increase. 

Under the FRB’s capital plan rule, large BHCs are required to 
submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the FRB 
has any objections before making any capital distributions. The 
rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material 
changes in a BHC’s risk profile, including as a result of any 
significant acquisitions. The FRB assesses, among other things, 
the overall financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy 
of BHCs when evaluating capital plans. 

Our 2019 capital plan, which was submitted on April 4, 2019, 

as part of CCAR, included a comprehensive capital outlook 
supported by an assessment of expected sources and uses of 
capital over a given planning horizon under a range of expected 
and stress scenarios. As part of the 2019 CCAR, the FRB also 
generated a supervisory stress test, which assumed a sharp 
decline in the economy and significant decline in asset pricing 
using the information provided by the Company to estimate 
performance. The FRB reviewed the supervisory stress results 
both as required under the Dodd-Frank Act using a common set 
of capital actions for all large BHCs and by taking into account 
the Company’s proposed capital actions. The FRB published its 
supervisory stress test results as required under the Dodd-Frank 
Act on June 21, 2019. On June 27, 2019, the FRB notified us that 
it did not object to our capital plan included in the 2019 CCAR. 

92 

Wells Fargo & Company 

  
 
Federal banking regulators require stress tests to evaluate 

whether an institution has sufficient capital to continue to 
operate during periods of adverse economic and financial 
conditions. These stress testing requirements set forth the 
timing and type of stress test activities large BHCs and banks 
must undertake as well as rules governing stress testing controls, 
oversight and disclosure requirements. The rules also limit a large 
BHC’s ability to make capital distributions to the extent its actual 
capital issuances were less than amounts indicated in its capital 
plan. Under the FRB’s stress testing rule, we were required to 
submit a mid-cycle stress test based on second quarter data and 
scenarios developed by the Company. We submitted the results 
of the mid-cycle stress test to the FRB and disclosed a summary 
of the results in October 2019. In October 2019, the FRB 
finalized rules that eliminate the mid-cycle stress test 
requirement for banks beginning in 2020. 

Securities Repurchases 
From time to time the Board authorizes the Company to 
repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce 
when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not 
give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Future 
stock repurchases may be private or open-market repurchases, 
including block transactions, accelerated or delayed block 
transactions, forward repurchase transactions, and similar 
transactions. Additionally, we may enter into plans to purchase 
stock that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934. Various factors determine the amount of 
our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the 
number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans 

Regulatory Matters 

Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, the U.S. 
financial services industry has been subject to a significant 
increase in regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This 
increased regulation and oversight has substantially changed 
how most U.S. financial services companies conduct business and 
has increased their regulatory compliance costs. The following 
highlights the more significant regulations and regulatory 
oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect our 
business. For additional information about the regulatory 
matters discussed below and other regulations and regulatory 
oversight matters, see Part I, Item 1 “Regulation and 
Supervision” of our 2019 Form 10-K, and the “Capital 
Management,” “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk 
Factors” sections and Note 29 (Regulatory and Agency Capital 
Requirements) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Dodd-Frank Act 
The Dodd-Frank Act is the most significant financial reform 
legislation since the 1930s and is driving much of the current U.S. 
regulatory reform efforts. The following provides additional 
information on the Dodd-Frank Act, including certain of its 
rulemaking initiatives. 
• 

Enhanced supervision and regulation of systemically important 
firms.  The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal 
banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and 
regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. 
The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing 
enhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding 
companies (BHCs) like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based 
capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, and 

and acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price 
of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations, including 
the FRB’s response to our capital plan and to changes in our risk 
profile. Due to the various factors impacting the amount of our 
share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be in the market 
regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations under our capital 
plan, our share repurchases occur at various price levels. We may 
suspend share repurchase activity at any time. 

In October 2018, the Board authorized the repurchase of 
350 million shares of our common stock. In July 2019, the Board 
authorized the repurchase of an additional 350 million shares of 
our common stock. At December 31, 2019, we had remaining 
authority to repurchase approximately 243 million shares, 
subject to regulatory and legal conditions. For more information 
about share repurchases during fourth quarter 2019, see Part II, 
Item 5 in our 2019 Form 10-K.

 Historically, our policy has been to repurchase shares under 

the “safe harbor” conditions of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 including a limitation on the daily volume 
of repurchases. Rule 10b-18 imposes an additional daily volume 
limitation on share repurchases during a pending merger or 
acquisition in which shares of our stock will constitute some or all 
of the consideration. Our management may determine that 
during a pending stock merger or acquisition when the safe 
harbor would otherwise be available, it is in our best interest to 
repurchase shares in excess of this additional daily volume 
limitation. In such cases, we intend to repurchase shares in 
compliance with the other conditions of the safe harbor, 
including the standing daily volume limitation that applies 
whether or not there is a pending stock merger or acquisition. 

imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators 
determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of 
the United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules 
implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs 
and national banks. The FRB has also finalized enhanced 
prudential standards that implement single counterparty 
credit limits, and has proposed a rule to establish 
remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing 
financial distress. Similarly, the FRB has proposed additional 
requirements regarding effective risk management 
practices at large BHCs, including its expectations for boards 
of directors and senior management. In addition to the 
authorization of enhanced supervisory and regulatory 
requirements for systemically important firms, the Dodd-
Frank Act also established the Financial Stability Oversight 
Council and the Office of Financial Research, which may 
recommend new systemic risk management requirements 
and require new reporting of systemic risks. The OCC, under 
separate authority, has also finalized guidelines establishing 
heightened governance and risk management standards for 
large national banks such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC 
guidelines require covered banks to establish and adhere to 
a written risk governance framework in order to manage and 
control their risk-taking activities. The guidelines also 
formalize roles and responsibilities for risk management 
practices within covered banks and create certain risk 
oversight responsibilities for their boards of directors. 
Regulation of consumer financial products.  The Dodd-Frank 
Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
(CFPB) to ensure consumers receive clear and accurate 

• 

Wells Fargo & Company

Regulatory Matters (continued) 

disclosures regarding financial products and to protect them 
from hidden fees and unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. 
With respect to residential mortgage lending, the CFPB 
issued a number of final rules implementing new origination, 
notification, disclosure and other requirements, as well as 
additional limitations on the fees and charges that may be 
increased from the estimates provided by lenders. The CFPB 
finalized amendments to the rule implementing the Home 
Mortgage Disclosure Act, resulting in a significant expansion 
of the data points lenders are required to collect and report 
to the CFPB. The CFPB also expanded the transactions 
covered by the rule and increased the reporting frequency 
from annual to quarterly for large volume lenders, such as 
Wells Fargo, beginning January 1, 2020. With respect to 
other financial products, the CFPB finalized rules, most of 
which became effective on April 1, 2019, to make prepaid 
cards subject to similar consumer protections as those 
provided by more traditional debit and credit cards such as 
fraud protection and expanded access to account 
information. In addition to these rulemaking activities, the 
CFPB is continuing its on-going supervisory examination 
activities of the financial services industry with respect to a 
number of consumer businesses and products, including 
mortgage lending and servicing, fair lending requirements, 
student lending activities, and automobile finance. 
Volcker Rule.  The Volcker Rule, with certain exceptions, 
prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary 
trading or owning any interest in or sponsoring or having 
certain relationships with a hedge fund, a private equity fund 
or certain structured transactions that are deemed covered 
funds. Federal banking regulators, the SEC, and the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) jointly 
released a final rule to implement the Volcker Rule’s 
restrictions, and have adopted amendments to the rule to 
streamline and tailor the requirements for compliance. 
Regulation of swaps and other derivatives activities.  The 
Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for 
regulating over-the-counter derivatives and authorized the 
CFTC and the SEC to regulate swaps and security-based 
swaps, respectively. The CFTC has adopted rules applicable 
to our provisionally registered swap dealer, Wells Fargo 
Bank, N.A., that require, among other things, extensive 
regulatory and public reporting of swaps, central clearing 
and trading of swaps on exchanges or other multilateral 
platforms, and compliance with comprehensive internal and 
external business conduct standards. The SEC has 
implemented parallel rules applicable to security-based 
swaps, and is expected to implement additional related 
rules. In addition, federal regulators have adopted final rules 
establishing initial and variation margin requirements for 
swaps and security-based swaps not centrally cleared, rules 
placing restrictions on a party’s right to exercise default 
rights under derivatives and other qualified financial 
contracts against applicable banking organizations, and 
record-keeping requirements for qualified financial 
contracts. All of these new rules, as well as others being 
considered by regulators in other jurisdictions, may 
negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter 
derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new 
derivatives or amendments to existing derivatives, and may 
increase our costs for engaging in swaps, security-based 
swaps, and other derivatives activities. 
Regulation of interchange transaction fees (the Durbin 
Amendment).  The FRB has enacted a rule to implement the 
Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, which limits 

debit card interchange transaction fees to those reasonable 
and proportional to the cost of the transaction. The rule 
generally established that the maximum allowable 
interchange fee that an issuer may receive or charge for an 
electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per 
transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the 
transaction. 

Regulatory Capital Guidelines and Capital Plans 
The Company and each of our insured depository institutions are 
subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements 
administered by the FRB and the OCC. For example, the 
Company is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators 
to implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking 
organizations. The Company and its insured depository 
institutions are also required to maintain specified 
supplementary leverage ratios. Federal banking regulators have 
also issued a final rule regarding the U.S. implementation of the 
Basel III liquidity coverage ratio. For more information on the 
final capital, leverage and liquidity rules, and additional capital 
requirements applicable to us, see the “Capital Management” 
and “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity 
and Funding – Liquidity Standards” sections in this Report. 

“Living Will” Requirements and Related Matters 
Rules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank 
Act require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to 
prepare and periodically submit resolution plans, also known as 
“living wills,” that would facilitate their rapid and orderly 
resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. 
Under the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a 
reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable 
period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the 
risk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the 
financial stability of the United States. In addition to the 
Company’s resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary, Wells 
Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), is also required to prepare and 
periodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and/or FDIC 
determine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may 
impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements 
on us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we 
adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC 
ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any 
deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or 
operations. On June 27, 2019, we submitted our resolution plan 
to the FRB and FDIC. On December 17, 2019, the FRB and FDIC 
announced that the Company’s 2019 resolution plan did not 
have any deficiencies, but they identified a specific shortcoming 
that would need to be addressed. 

If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy 
proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution 
regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly 
liquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for 
the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically 
important financial institution that is in default or in danger of 
default if, among other things, the resolution of the institution 
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse 
effects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is 
appointed as receiver for Wells Fargo & Company (the “Parent”), 
then the orderly liquidation authority, rather than the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver 
and the rights and obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s 
orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a 
company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are

exposed to any losses, and allows the FDIC to disregard the strict 
priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 
certain circumstances. 

 The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is 

a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would likely 
be the only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. 
However, we are not obligated to maintain a single point of entry 
strategy, and the strategy described in our resolution plan is not 
binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, 
whether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the 
FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC has 
announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a 
desirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly 
liquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might 
exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is 
possible. 

To facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important 
financial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal 
banking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, 
maintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to 
absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal 
banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the 
continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding 
the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on 
parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging 
institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital 
and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries in order to 
facilitate an orderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ 
guidance and to facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, 
on June 28, 2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, 
as amended and restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support 
Agreement”), with WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding 
company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, 
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing 
Services, LLC (“WFCS”), and certain other direct and indirect 
subsidiaries of the Parent designated as material entities for 
resolution planning purposes (the “Covered Entities”) or 
identified as related support entities in our resolution plan (the 
“Related Support Entities”). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, 
the Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets, 
including the majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and 
intercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its 
subsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will 
continue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time 
to time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, 
the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide 
capital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered 
Entities pursuant to the Support Agreement. Under the Support 
Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the 
Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of 
credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is 
expected to provide the Parent, during business as usual 
operating conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to 
service its debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and 
perform its other obligations as it would have had if it had not 
entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. If 
certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, 
or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case 
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would 
be forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and 
the IHC’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be 
restricted, any of which could materially and adversely impact 
the Parent’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other 
obligations, and could result in the commencement of 
bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than 

might have otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were 
not implemented. The respective obligations under the Support 
Agreement of the Parent, the IHC, the Bank, and the Related 
Support Entities are secured pursuant to a related security 
agreement. 

In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and 

submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a range of 
options that we may consider during times of idiosyncratic or 
systemic economic stress to remedy any financial weaknesses 
and restore market confidence without extraordinary 
government support. Recovery options include the possible sale, 
transfer or disposal of assets, securities, loan portfolios or 
businesses. The Bank must also prepare and submit to the OCC a 
recovery plan that sets forth the Bank’s plan to remain a going 
concern when the Bank is experiencing considerable financial or 
operational stress, but has not yet deteriorated to the point 
where liquidation or resolution is imminent. If either the FRB or 
the OCC determines that our recovery plan is deficient, they may 
impose fines, restrictions on our business or ultimately require us 
to divest assets. 

Other Regulatory Related Matters 
• 

Broker-dealer standards of conduct.  In June 2019, the SEC 
finalized a rule that requires broker-dealers to act in the best 
interest of a retail customer when making a 
recommendation of any securities transaction or 
investment strategy involving securities. This rule impacts 
the manner in which business is conducted with customers 
seeking investment advice and may affect certain 
investment product offerings. 
Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating.  In March 2017, 
we announced that the OCC had downgraded our most 
recent CRA rating, which covers the years 2009 – 2012, to 
“Needs to Improve” due to previously issued regulatory 
consent orders. A “Needs to Improve” rating imposes 
regulatory restrictions and limitations on certain of the 
Company’s nonbank activities, including its ability to engage 
in certain nonbank mergers and acquisitions or undertake 
new financial in nature activities, and CRA performance is 
taken into account by regulators in reviewing applications to 
establish bank branches and for approving proposed bank 
mergers and acquisitions. The rating also results in the loss 
of expedited processing of applications to undertake certain 
activities, and requires the Company to receive prior 
regulatory approval for certain activities, including to issue 
or prepay certain subordinated debt obligations, open or 
relocate bank branches, or make certain public welfare 
investments. In addition, a “Needs to Improve” rating could 
have an impact on the Company’s relationships with certain 
states, counties, municipalities or other public agencies to 
the extent applicable law, regulation or policy limits, restricts 
or influences whether such entity may do business with a 
company that has a below “Satisfactory” rating. 
FRB consent order regarding governance oversight and 
compliance and operational risk management.  On February 2, 
2018, the Company entered into a consent order with the 
FRB. As required by the consent order, the Board submitted 
to the FRB a plan to further enhance the Board’s governance 
and oversight of the Company, and the Company submitted 
to the FRB a plan to further improve the Company’s 
compliance and operational risk management program. The 
Company continues to engage with the FRB as the Company 
works to address the consent order provisions. The consent 
order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s 
acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s

adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an 
initial third-party review of the enhancements and 
improvements provided for in the plans. Until this third-
party review is complete and the plans are approved and 
implemented to the satisfaction of the FRB, the Company’s 
total consolidated assets will be limited to the level as of 
December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap will be 
measured on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for 
management of temporary fluctuations. Additionally, after 
removal of the asset cap, a second third-party review must 
also be conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of 
the enhancements and improvements. 
Consent orders with the CFPB and OCC regarding compliance 
risk management program, automobile collateral protection 
insurance policies, and mortgage interest rate lock extensions. 
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent 
orders with the CFPB and OCC to pay an aggregate of 
$1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters 
regarding the Company’s compliance risk management 
program and past practices involving certain automobile 
collateral protection insurance policies and certain

Report) are fundamental to understanding our results of 
operations and financial condition because they require that we 
use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our 
assets or liabilities and financial results. Five of these policies are 
critical because they require management to make difficult, 
subjective and complex judgments about matters that are 
inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially 
different amounts would be reported under different conditions 
or using different assumptions. These policies govern: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

the allowance for credit losses; 
the valuation of residential MSRs; 
the fair value of financial instruments; 
income taxes; and 
liability for contingent litigation losses. 

Management and the Board’s Audit Committee have 
reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 
We maintain an allowance for credit losses, which consists of the 
allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit 
commitments, which is management’s estimate of credit losses 
inherent in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit 
commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans carried 
at fair value. For a description of our related accounting policies, 
see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Changes in the allowance for credit losses and, therefore, in 
the related provision for credit losses, can materially affect net 
income. In applying the judgment and review required to 
determine the allowance for credit losses, management 
considers changes in economic conditions, customer behavior, 
and collateral value, among other influences. From time to time, 
economic factors or business decisions, such as the addition or 
liquidation of a loan product or business unit, may affect the loan 
portfolio, causing management to increase or decrease the 
allowance for credit losses. While our methodology attributes 
portions of the allowance for credit losses to specific portfolio 

mortgage interest rate lock extensions. As required by the 
consent orders, the Company submitted to the CFPB and 
OCC an enterprise-wide compliance risk management plan 
and a plan to enhance the Company’s internal audit program 
with respect to federal consumer financial law and the terms 
of the consent orders. In addition, as required by the consent 
orders, the Company submitted for non-objection plans to 
remediate customers affected by the automobile collateral 
protection insurance and mortgage interest rate lock 
matters, as well as a plan for the management of 
remediation activities conducted by the Company. 
•  OCC approval of director and senior executive officer 

appointments and certain post-termination payments.  Under 
the April 2018 consent order with the OCC, Wells Fargo 
Bank, N.A., remains subject to requirements that were 
originally imposed in November 2016 to provide prior 
written notice to, and obtain non-objection from, the OCC 
with respect to changes in directors and senior executive 
officers, and remains subject to certain regulatory 
limitations on post-termination payments to certain 
individuals and employees. 

segments (commercial and consumer), the entire allowance for 
credit losses is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the 
total loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments.

Judgment is specifically applied in: 
Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans and 
unfunded credit commitments.  We estimate the probability 
of default in accordance with the borrower’s financial 
strength using a borrower quality rating and the severity of 
loss in the event of default using a collateral quality rating. 
Collectively, these ratings are referred to as credit risk 
ratings and are assigned to our commercial loans. Probability 
of default and severity at the time of default are statistically 
derived through historical observations of defaults and 
losses after default within each credit risk rating. 
Commercial loan risk ratings are evaluated based on each 
situation by experienced senior credit officers and are 
subject to periodic review by an internal team of credit 
specialists. 
Economic assumptions applied to pools of consumer loans 
(statistically modeled).  Losses are estimated using economic 
variables to represent our best estimate of inherent loss. 
Our forecasted losses are modeled using a range of 
economic scenarios. 
Selection of a credit loss estimation model that fits the credit 
risk characteristics of its portfolio.  We use both internally 
developed and vendor supplied models in this process. We 
often use expected loss, transition rate, flow rate, 
competing hazard, vintage maturation, and time series or 
statistical trend models, including those with economic 
correlations. Management must use judgment in 
establishing additional input metrics for the modeling 
processes, considering further stratification into reference 
data time series, sub-product, origination channel, vintage, 
loss type, geographic location and other predictive 
characteristics. The models used to determine the allowance 
for credit losses are validated in accordance with Company 
policies by an internal model validation group.

reflect other risks that may be identified from current 
conditions and developments in selected portfolios. 
Identification and measurement of impaired loans, including 
loans modified in a TDR.  Our experienced senior credit 
officers may consider a loan impaired based on their 
evaluation of current information and events, including loans 
modified in a TDR. The measurement of impairment is 
typically based on an analysis of the present value of 
expected future cash flows. The development of these 
expectations requires significant management judgment 
and review. 
An amount for imprecision or uncertainty which reflects 
management’s overall estimate of the effect of quantitative 
and qualitative factors on inherent credit losses.  This amount 
represents management’s judgment of risks inherent in the 
processes and assumptions used in establishing the 
allowance for credit losses. This imprecision considers 
economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and 
performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, 
including industry trends and emerging risk assessments.

Losses” section and Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit 
Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for further 
discussion of our allowance for credit losses. 

Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights 
(MSRs) 
MSRs are assets that represent the rights to service mortgage 
loans for others. We recognize MSRs when we purchase 
servicing rights from third parties, or retain servicing rights in 
connection with the sale or securitization of loans we originate 
(asset transfers). We also have acquired MSRs in the past under 
co-issuer agreements that provide for us to service loans that 
were originated and securitized by third-party correspondents. 

We carry our MSRs related to residential mortgage loans 
at fair value. Periodic changes in our residential MSRs and the 
economic hedges used to hedge our residential MSRs are 
reflected in earnings. 

We use a model to estimate the fair value of our 

residential MSRs. The model is validated by an internal model 

validation group operating in accordance with Company 
policies. The model calculates the present value of estimated 
future net servicing income and incorporates inputs and 
assumptions that market participants use in estimating fair 
value. Certain significant inputs and assumptions generally are 
not observable in the market and require judgment to 
determine. If observable market indications do become 
available, these are factored into the estimates as appropriate: 
• 

The mortgage loan prepayment speed used to estimate future 
net servicing income.  The prepayment speed is the annual 
rate at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their 
mortgage loan principal; this rate also includes estimated 
borrower defaults. We use models to estimate prepayment 
speeds and borrower defaults which are influenced by 
changes in mortgage interest rates and borrower behavior. 
The discount rate used to present value estimated future net 
servicing income.  The discount rate is the required rate of 
return investors in the market would expect for an asset 
with similar risk. To determine the discount rate, we consider 
the risk premium for uncertainties in the cash flow 
estimates such as from servicing operations (e.g., possible 
changes in future servicing costs, ancillary income and 
earnings on escrow accounts). 
The expected cost to service loans used to estimate future net 
servicing income.  The cost to service loans includes 
estimates for unreimbursed expenses, such as delinquency 
and foreclosure costs, which considers the number of 
defaulted loans as well as changes in servicing processes 
associated with default and foreclosure management. 

• 

• 

Both prepayment speed and discount rate assumptions can, 

and generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and 
mortgage interest rates change. For example, an increase in 
either the prepayment speed or discount rate assumption results 
in a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in 
either assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of 
the MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market-
driven fluctuations in loan prepayment speeds and the discount 
rate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in 
the future. Additionally, while our current valuation reflects our 
best estimate of servicing costs, future regulatory or investor 
changes in servicing standards, as well as changes in individual 
state foreclosure legislation or additional market participant 
information regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an 
impact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation 
in future periods. 

For a description of our valuation and sensitivity of MSRs, 

see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), 
Note 10 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities), Note 11 
(Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 19 (Fair Values of Assets 
and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell the 
financial asset or paid to transfer the financial liability in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. 

We use fair value measurements to record fair value 
adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine 
fair value disclosures. For example, assets and liabilities held for 
trading purposes, marketable equity securities not held for 
trading purposes, debt securities available for sale, derivatives 
and most of our residential MLHFS are carried at fair value each 
period. Other financial instruments, such as certain MLHFS, 
most nonmarketable equity securities and substantially all of 

Wells Fargo & Company 

97 

  
 
Critical Accounting Policies (continued) 

our loans held for investment, are not carried at fair value each 
period but may require nonrecurring fair value adjustments due 
to application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting, 
measurement alternative accounting or write-downs of 
individual assets. We also disclose our estimate of fair value for 
financial instruments not recorded at fair value, such as loans 
held for investment or issuances of long-term debt. 

The accounting requirements for fair value measurements 

include a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and 
liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and 
liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to 
the valuation methodology used for measurement are 
observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-
derived or market-based information obtained from 
independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our 
estimates about market data. For additional information on fair 
value levels, see Note 19 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

When developing fair value measurements, we maximize the 

use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable 
inputs. When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to 
measure fair value. If quoted prices in active markets are not 
available, fair value measurement is based upon models that 
generally use market-based or independently sourced market 
parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment 
speeds, option volatilities and currency rates. However, when 
observable market data is limited or not available, fair value 
estimates are typically determined using internally-developed 
models based on unobservable inputs. Internal models used to 
determine fair value are validated in accordance with Company 
policies by an internal model validation group. Additionally, we 
use third-party pricing services to obtain fair values, which are 
used to either record the price of an instrument or to 
corroborate internally-developed prices. Third-party price 
validation procedures are performed over the reasonableness of 
the fair value measurements. For additional information on our 
use of pricing services, see Note 19 (Fair Value of Assets and 
Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

When using internally-developed models based on 

unobservable inputs, management judgment is necessary as we 
are required to make judgments about significant assumptions 
market participants would use to estimate fair value. 
Determination of these assumptions includes consideration of 
market conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market 
conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or 
changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the 
availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data 
used to determine fair value. In such cases, it may be appropriate 
to adjust available quoted prices or observable market data. For 
example, we adjust the vendor or broker price using internal 
models based on discounted cash flows when the impact of 
illiquid markets has not already been incorporated in the fair 
value measurement. Additionally, for certain residential MLHFS 
and certain debt and equity securities where the significant 
inputs have become unobservable due to illiquid markets and 
vendor or broker pricing is not used, our discounted cash flow 
model uses a discount rate that reflects what we believe a 
market participant would require in light of the illiquid market. 
We continually assess the level and volume of market 
activity in our debt and equity security classes in determining 
adjustments, if any, to price quotes. Given market conditions can 
change over time, our determination of which securities markets 
are considered active or inactive can change. If we determine a 
market to be inactive, the degree to which price quotes require 
adjustment, can also change. 

Significant judgment is also required to determine whether 
certain assets measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 or 
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as described in Note 1 
(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

When making this judgment, we consider available 
information, including observable market data, indications of 
market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the 
valuation techniques and significant inputs used to estimate fair 
value. The classification of Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the 
specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or 
instrument category and judgments are made regarding the 
significance of the Level 3 inputs to each instrument’s fair value 
measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered 
significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3.

fair value on a recurring basis and (2) Level 3 assets and liabilities 
recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, both presented as a

Income Taxes 
We file consolidated and separate company U.S. federal income 
tax returns, non-U.S. tax returns and various combined and 
separate company state tax returns. 

We evaluate two components of income tax expense: 
current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax 
expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded 
for the current period and includes income tax expense related to 
our uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet 
the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to 
determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax 
position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that 
management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of 
realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our 
realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. 

Deferred income tax expense results from changes in 

deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. We determine 
deferred income taxes using the balance sheet method. Under 
this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the 
tax effects of the differences between the book and tax basis of 
assets and liabilities, and recognizes enacted changes in tax rates 
and laws in the period in which they occur. Deferred tax assets 
are recognized subject to management’s judgment that 
realization is more likely than not. 

We do not intend to distribute earnings of certain non-U.S. 

subsidiaries in a taxable manner, and therefore intend to limit

We apply judgment when establishing an accrual for 

potential losses associated with legal actions and in establishing 
the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the accrual. 
Our judgment in establishing accruals and the range of 
reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for 
probable and estimable losses is influenced by our understanding 
of information currently available related to the legal evaluation 
and potential outcome of actions, including input and advice on 
these matters from our internal counsel, external counsel and 
senior management. These matters may be in various stages of 
investigation, discovery or proceedings. They may also involve a 
wide variety of claims across our businesses, legal entities and 
jurisdictions. The eventual outcome may be a scenario that was 
not considered or was considered remote in anticipated 
occurrence. Accordingly, our estimate of potential losses will 
change over time and the actual losses may vary significantly. 

The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject 

to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to 
determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also 
inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there 
may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably 
possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses 
may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of 
reasonably possible loss. 

See Note 17 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this 

Report for further information. 

distributions of non-U.S. earnings previously taxed in the U.S., 
that would qualify for the 100% dividends received deduction, 
and that would not result in any significant state or non-U.S. 
taxes. All other undistributed non-U.S. earnings will continue to 
be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and the related tax 
liability on these earnings is insignificant. 

The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate 

are complex and subject to different interpretations by the 
taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. In 
establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make 
judgments and interpretations about the application of these 
inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about 
when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the 
various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and international. Our 
interpretations may be subjected to review during examination 
by taxing authorities and disputes may arise over the respective 
tax positions. We attempt to resolve these disputes during the 
tax examination and audit process and ultimately through the 
court systems when applicable. 

We monitor relevant tax authorities and revise our estimate 

of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and 
their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities on a 
quarterly basis. Revisions of our estimate of accrued income 
taxes also may result from our own income tax planning and 
from the resolution of income tax controversies. Such revisions 
in our estimates may be material to our operating results for any 
given quarter. 

See Note 24 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this 

Report for a further description of our provision for income taxes 
and related income tax assets and liabilities. 

Liability for Contingent Litigation Losses 
The Company is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory, 
governmental, arbitration and other proceedings or 
investigations concerning matters arising from the conduct of its 
business activities, and many of those proceedings and 
investigations expose the Company to potential financial loss. 
We establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses 
associated with the actions become probable and the costs can 
be reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we record the 
amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of 
potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if 
we cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low 
end of the range of those potential losses. The actual costs of 
resolving legal actions may be substantially higher or lower than 
the amounts accrued for those actions.

Current Accounting Developments 

Table 51 provides the significant accounting updates applicable 
to us that have been issued by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (FASB) but are not yet effective. 

Table 51:  Current Accounting Developments – Issued Standards 

Description 

Effective date and financial statement impact 

ASU 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): 
Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts and subsequent related updates 

The Update requires all features in 
long-duration insurance contracts 
that meet the definition of a market 
risk benefit to be measured at fair 
value through earnings with changes 
in fair value attributable to our own 
credit risk recognized in other 
comprehensive income. Currently, 
two measurement models exist for 
these features, fair value and 
insurance accrual. The Update 
requires the use of a standardized 
discount rate and routine updates for 
insurance assumptions used in 
valuing the liability for future policy 
benefits for traditional long-duration 
contracts. The Update also simplifies 
the amortization of deferred 
acquisition costs. 

The guidance becomes effective on January 1, 2022. Certain of our variable annuity reinsurance products meet 
the definition of market risk benefits and will require the associated insurance related reserves for these 
products to be measured at fair value as of the earliest period presented, with the cumulative effect on fair 
value for changes attributable to our own credit risk recognized in the beginning balance of accumulated other 
comprehensive income. The cumulative effect of the difference between fair value and carrying value, 
excluding the effect of our own credit, will be recognized in the opening balance of retained earnings. As of 
December 31, 2019, we held $1.1 billion in insurance-related reserves of which $489 million was in scope of 
the Update. A total of $429 million was associated with products that meet the definition of market risk 
benefits, and of this amount, $17 million was measured at fair value under current accounting standards. The 
market risk benefits are largely indexed to U.S. equity and fixed income markets. Upon adoption, we may incur 
periodic earnings volatility from changes in the fair value of market risk benefits generally due to the long 
duration of these contracts. We plan to economically hedge this volatility, where feasible. The ultimate impact 
of these changes will depend on the composition of our market risk benefits portfolio at the date of adoption. 
Changes in the accounting for the liability of future policy benefits for traditional long-duration contracts and 
deferred acquisition costs will be applied to all outstanding long-duration contracts on the basis of their 
existing carrying amounts at the beginning of the earliest period presented, and are not expected to be 
material. 

We adopted the guidance on January 1, 2020. Our implementation process included development of loss 
forecasting models, evaluation of technical accounting topics, updates to our allowance documentation, 
reporting processes, and related internal controls. 

Upon adoption, we recognized an overall decrease in our ACL of approximately $1.3 billion, as a 
cumulative effect adjustment from change in accounting policies. This adjustment, net of income tax 
adjustments, increased our retained earnings and regulatory capital amounts and ratios. For more information 
on the impact of CECL by type of financial asset, see Table 51b (ASU 2016-03 Adoption Impact to Allowance 
for Credit Losses (ACL)) in this Report. 

Our approach for estimating expected life-time credit losses for loans and debt securities includes the 

following key components: 
• 

ASU 2016-13 – Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): 
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments and subsequent related updates 
The Update changes the accounting 
for the measurement of credit losses 
on loans and debt securities. For loans 
and held-to-maturity debt securities, 
the Update requires a current 
expected credit loss (CECL) 
measurement to estimate the 
allowance for credit losses (ACL) for 
the remaining contractual term, 
adjusted for prepayments, of the 
financial asset (including off-balance 
sheet credit exposures) using 
historical experience, current 
conditions, and reasonable and 
supportable forecasts. The Update 
eliminates the existing guidance for 
PCI loans, but requires an allowance 
for purchased financial assets with 
more than an insignificant 
deterioration of credit since 
origination. In addition, the Update 
modifies the other-than-temporary 
impairment model for available-for-
sale debt securities to require an 
allowance for credit impairment 
instead of a direct write-down, which 
allows for reversal of credit 
impairments in future periods based 
on improvements in credit. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

An initial loss forecast period of one year for all portfolio segments and classes of financing receivables 
and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. This period reflects management’s expectation of losses based 
on forward-looking economic scenarios over that time. 
A historical loss forecast period covering the remaining contractual term, adjusted for prepayments, by 
portfolio segment and class of financing receivables based on the change in key historical economic 
variables during representative historical expansionary and recessionary periods. 
A reversion period of up to two years connecting the initial loss forecast to the historical loss forecast 
based on economic conditions at the measurement date. 
Utilization of discounted cash flow (DCF) methods to measure credit impairment for loans modified in a 
troubled debt restructuring, unless they are collateral dependent and measured at the fair value of 
collateral. The DCF methods obtain estimated life-time credit losses using the conceptual components 
described above. 
For available-for-sale debt securities and certain beneficial interests classified as held-to-maturity, we 
utilize the DCF methods to measure the ACL, which incorporate expected credit losses using the 
conceptual components described above. The ACL on available-for-sale debt securities is subject to a 
limitation based on the fair value of the debt securities. 

We expect future changes in our ACL to be more volatile under CECL. Future amounts of the ACL will be 
based on a variety of factors, including changes in loan volumes, portfolio credit quality, and general economic 
conditions. General economic conditions will be forecasted using economic variables, which will create 
volatility as those variables change over time. See Table 51a for key economic variables used for our loan 
portfolios.

Forward-Looking Statements 

This document contains forward-looking statements. In addition, 
we may make forward-looking statements in our other 
documents filed or furnished with the SEC, and our management 
may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, 
investors, representatives of the media and others. Forward-
looking statements can be identified by words such as 
“anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” 
“expects,” “target,” “projects,” “outlook,” “forecast,” “will,” “may,” 
“could,” “should,” “can” and similar references to future periods. In 
particular, forward-looking statements include, but are not 
limited to, statements we make about: (i) the future operating or 
financial performance of the Company, including our outlook for 
future growth; (ii) our noninterest expense and efficiency ratio; 
(iii) future credit quality and performance, including our 
expectations regarding future loan losses and our allowance for 
credit losses; (iv) the appropriateness of the allowance for credit 
losses; (v) our expectations regarding net interest income and 
net interest margin; (vi) loan growth or the reduction or 
mitigation of risk in our loan portfolios; (vii) future capital or 
liquidity levels or targets, our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 
ratio, and our estimated total loss absorbing capacity ratio; (viii) 
the performance of our mortgage business and any related 
exposures; (ix) the expected outcome and impact of legal, 
regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our 
expectations regarding compliance therewith; (x) future 
common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other 
uses of capital; (xi) our targeted range for return on assets, 
return on equity, and return on tangible common equity; (xii) 
expectations regarding our effective income tax rate; (xiii) the 
outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings; and (xiv) 
the Company’s plans, objectives and strategies. 

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical 

facts but instead represent our current expectations and 
assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other 
future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to 
the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and 
changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual 
results may differ materially from those contemplated by the 
forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against 
relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are 
neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or 
assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance 
that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those in the forward-looking statements include 
the following, without limitation: 
• 

current and future economic and market conditions, 
including the effects of declines in housing prices, high 
unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax 
matters, geopolitical matters, and any slowdown in global 
economic growth; 
our capital and liquidity requirements (including under 
regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital 
standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or 
raise capital on favorable terms; 
financial services reform and other current, pending or 
future legislation or regulation that could have a negative 
effect on our revenue and businesses, including the Dodd-
Frank Act and other legislation and regulation relating to 
bank products and services; 
developments in our mortgage banking business, including 
the extent of the success of our mortgage loan modification

• 

efforts, the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands 
that we receive, any negative effects relating to our 
mortgage servicing, loan modification or foreclosure 
practices, and the effects of regulatory or judicial 
requirements or guidance impacting our mortgage banking 
business and any changes in industry standards; 
our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as 
part of our expense management initiatives, including as a 
result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, 
changes in our business composition and operating 
environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, 
and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, 
litigation and regulatory matters; 
the effect of the current interest rate environment or 
changes in interest rates or in the level or composition of our 
assets or liabilities on our net interest income, net interest 
margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing 
rights and mortgage loans held for sale; 
significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or 
financial markets, which could result in, among other things, 
reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in 
the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and 
declines in asset values and/or recognition of other-than-
temporary impairment on securities held in our debt 
securities and equity securities portfolios; 
the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment 
banking business and our fee income from our brokerage, 
asset and wealth management businesses; 
negative effects from the retail banking sales practices 
matter and from other instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, including on our legal, 
operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in 
certain business activities or offer certain products or 
services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our 
ability to attract and retain qualified team members, and our 
reputation; 
resolution of regulatory matters, litigation, or other legal 
actions, which may result in, among other things, additional 
costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, 
reputational harm, or other adverse consequences; 
a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems 
or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or 
other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks; 
the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings 
account deposits on our funding costs and net interest 
margin; 
fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; 
changes to U.S. tax guidance and regulations, as well as the 
effect of discrete items on our effective income tax rate; 
our ability to develop and execute effective business plans 
and strategies; and 
the other risk factors and uncertainties described under 
“Risk Factors” in this Report.

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the 
amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or 
repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and 
financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital 
requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common 
stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations 
(including federal securities laws and federal banking 
regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by the

Company’s Board of Directors, and may be subject to regulatory 
approval or conditions. 

For more information about factors that could cause actual 

results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our 
reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in this Report, as 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available 
on its website at www.sec.gov. 

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as 

of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could 
cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, 
and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake 
no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, 
whether as a result of new information, future developments or 
otherwise, except as may be required by law. 

Risk Factors 

An investment in the Company involves risk, including the 
possibility that the value of the investment could fall 
substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the 
investment could be reduced or eliminated. We discuss below 
risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and 
condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the 
Company. 

RISKS RELATED TO THE ECONOMY, FINANCIAL MARKETS, 
INTEREST RATES AND LIQUIDITY 

As one of the largest lenders in the U.S. and a provider of 
financial products and services to consumers and businesses 
across the U.S. and internationally, our financial results have 
been, and will continue to be, materially affected by 
general economic conditions, and a deterioration in economic 
conditions or in the financial markets may materially adversely 
affect our lending and other businesses and our financial 
results and condition.  We generate revenue from the interest 
and fees we charge on the loans and other products and services 
we sell, and a substantial amount of our revenue and earnings 
comes from the net interest income and fee income that we earn 
from our consumer and commercial lending and banking 
businesses, including our mortgage banking business. These 
businesses have been, and will continue to be, materially affected 
by the state of the U.S. economy, particularly unemployment 
levels and home prices. Although the U.S. economy has 
continued to gradually improve from the depressed levels of 
2008 and early 2009, economic growth has at times been slow 
and uneven. In addition, the negative effects and continued 
uncertainty stemming from U.S. fiscal and political matters, 
including concerns about deficit levels, taxes and U.S. debt 
ratings, have impacted and may continue to impact the global 
economic recovery. Moreover, geopolitical matters, including 
international political unrest or disturbances, Britain’s vote to 
withdraw from the European Union, as well as continued 
concerns over commodity prices, restrictions on international 
trade and corresponding retaliatory measures, and global 
economic difficulties, may impact the stability of financial 
markets and the global economy. In particular, Britain’s 
withdrawal from the European Union and the final terms of its 
exit following the existing transition period could increase 
economic barriers between Britain and the European Union, limit 
our ability to conduct business in the European Union, impose 
additional costs on us, subject us to different laws, regulations 
and/or regulatory authorities, or adversely impact our business, 

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures. From time to 
time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP 
financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets 
for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to 
provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial 
measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial 
measures because we are unable to provide, without 
unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or 
estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the 
reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in 
forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may 
occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future 
results. 

financial results and operating model. For example, certain 
operations of our broker-dealer in London may be impacted by 
the terms and conditions of Britain’s exit. Although we are 
transitioning certain of these operations to other European 
countries, there is no guarantee that we will be able to operate or 
conduct business in the European Union in the same manner or 
with the same effectiveness following the end of the transition 
period for Britain’s withdrawal. A prolonged period of slow 
growth in the global economy, particularly in the U.S., or any 
deterioration in general economic conditions and/or the financial 
markets resulting from the above matters or any other events or 
factors that may disrupt or dampen the global economic 
recovery, could materially adversely affect our financial results 
and condition. 

A weakening in business or economic conditions, including 
higher unemployment levels or declines in home prices, can also 
adversely affect our borrowers’ ability to repay their loans, which 
can negatively impact our credit performance. If unemployment 
levels worsen or if home prices fall we would expect to incur 
elevated charge-offs and provision expense from increases in our 
allowance for credit losses. These conditions may adversely 
affect not only consumer loan performance but also commercial 
and CRE loans, especially for those business borrowers that rely 
on the health of industries that may experience deteriorating 
economic conditions. The ability of these and other borrowers to 
repay their loans may deteriorate, causing us, as one of the 
largest commercial and CRE lenders in the U.S., to incur 
significantly higher credit losses. In addition, weak or 
deteriorating economic conditions make it more challenging for 
us to increase our consumer and commercial loan portfolios by 
making loans to creditworthy borrowers at attractive yields. 
Furthermore, weak economic conditions, as well as competition 
and/or increases in interest rates, could soften demand for our 
loans resulting in our retaining a much higher amount of lower 
yielding liquid assets on our balance sheet. If economic 
conditions do not continue to improve or if the economy 
worsens and unemployment rises, which also would likely result 
in a decrease in consumer and business confidence and spending, 
the demand for our credit products, including our mortgages, 
may fall, reducing our interest and noninterest income and our 
earnings. 

A deterioration in business and economic conditions, which 

may erode consumer and investor confidence levels, and/or 
increased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely 
affect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including 
our investment advisory, mutual fund, securities brokerage, 

Wells Fargo & Company

Risk Factors (continued) 

wealth management, and investment banking businesses. In 
2019, approximately 25% of our revenue was fee income, which 
included trust and investment fees, card fees and other fees. We 
earn fee income from managing assets for others and providing 
brokerage and other investment advisory and wealth 
management services. Because investment management fees 
are often based on the value of assets under management, a fall 
in the market prices of those assets could reduce our fee income. 
Changes in stock market prices could affect the trading activity 
of investors, reducing commissions and other fees we earn from 
our brokerage business. In addition, adverse market conditions 
may negatively affect the performance of products we have 
provided to customers, which may expose us to legal actions or 
additional costs. The U.S. stock market experienced all-time 
highs in 2019, but also experienced significant volatility and 
there is no guarantee that high price levels will continue or that 
price levels will stabilize. Poor economic conditions and volatile or 
unstable financial markets also can negatively affect our debt 
and equity underwriting and advisory businesses, as well as our 
trading activities and venture capital businesses. Any 
deterioration in global financial markets and economies, 
including as a result of any international political unrest or 
disturbances, may adversely affect the revenues and earnings of 
our international operations, particularly our global financial 
institution and correspondent banking services. 

For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management” and “– Credit Risk Management” 
sections in this Report. 

Changes in interest rates and financial market values could 
reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our 
other comprehensive income, including as a result of 
recognizing losses on the debt and equity securities that we 
hold in our portfolio or trade for our customers.  Our net 
interest income is the interest we earn on loans, debt securities 
and other assets we hold less the interest we pay on our 
deposits, long-term and short-term debt, and other liabilities. 
Net interest income is a measure of both our net interest margin 
– the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the 
interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of 
funding – and the amount of earning assets we hold. Changes in 
either our net interest margin or the amount or mix of earning 
assets we hold could affect our net interest income and our 
earnings. Changes in interest rates can affect our net interest 
margin. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding 
costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes 
in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing 
our net interest margin to expand or contract. If our funding 
costs rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets or if the 
yield we earn on our assets falls faster than our funding costs, 
our net interest margin could contract. 

The amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect 
our yield and net interest margin. We hold earning assets in the 
form of loans and debt and equity securities, among other 
assets. As noted above, if the economy worsens we may see 
lower demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our 
net interest income and yield. In addition, our net interest 
income and net interest margin can be negatively affected by a 
prolonged low interest rate environment as it may result in us 
holding lower yielding loans and securities on our balance sheet, 
particularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher 
yielding assets with similar higher yielding assets. Increases in 
interest rates, however, may negatively affect loan demand and 
could result in higher credit losses as borrowers may have more 
difficulty making higher interest payments. As described below, 

changes in interest rates also affect our mortgage business, 
including the value of our MSRs. 

Changes in the slope of the “yield curve” – or the spread 

between short-term and long-term interest rates – could also 
reduce our net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is 
upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-
term rates. When the yield curve flattens, or even inverts, our net 
interest margin could decrease if the cost of our short-term 
funding increases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-
term assets. Moreover, a negative interest rate environment, in 
which interest rates drop below zero, could reduce our net 
interest margin and net interest income due to a likely decline in 
the interest we could earn on loans and other earning assets, 
while also likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with 
the FRB. 

The interest we earn on our loans may be tied to U.S.-
denominated interest rates such as the federal funds rate while 
the interest we pay on our debt may be based on international 
rates such as LIBOR. If the federal funds rate were to fall without 
a corresponding decrease in LIBOR, we might earn less on our 
loans without any offsetting decrease in our funding costs. This 
could lower our net interest margin and our net interest income. 
We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on 

our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on 
assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of 
interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We hedge 
some of that interest rate risk with interest rate derivatives. We 
also rely on the “natural hedge” that our mortgage loan 
originations and servicing rights can provide. 

We generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There 
is always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or 
option volatility could reduce our net interest income and 
earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material 
amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially 
different than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates 
rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve 
changes, we may incur significant losses on debt securities we 
hold as investments. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may 
rebalance our portfolios of debt securities, equity securities and 
loans, refinance our debt and take other strategic actions. We 
may incur losses when we take such actions. 

We hold debt and equity securities, including U.S. Treasury 

and federal agency securities and federal agency MBS, securities 
of U.S. states and political subdivisions, residential and 
commercial MBS, corporate debt securities, other asset-backed 
securities and marketable equity securities, including securities 
relating to our venture capital activities. Because of changing 
economic and market conditions, as well as credit ratings, 
affecting issuers and the performance of any collateral 
underlying the securities, we may be required to recognize OTTI 
in future periods on the securities we hold. Furthermore, the 
value of the debt securities we hold can fluctuate due to changes 
in interest rates, issuer creditworthiness, and other factors. Our 
net income also is exposed to changes in interest rates, credit 
spreads, foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity 
prices in connection with our trading activities, which are 
conducted primarily to accommodate the investment and risk 
management activities of our customers, as well as when we 
execute economic hedging to manage certain balance sheet 
risks. Trading debt securities and equity securities held for 
trading are carried at fair value with realized and unrealized gains 
and losses recorded in noninterest income. As part of our 
business to support our customers, we trade public debt and 
equity securities that are subject to market fluctuations with 
gains and losses recognized in net income. In addition, although 

104 

Wells Fargo & Company 

  
high market volatility can increase our exposure to trading-
related losses, periods of low volatility may have an adverse 
effect on our businesses as a result of reduced customer activity 
levels. Although we have processes in place to measure and 
monitor the risks associated with our trading activities, including 
stress testing and hedging strategies, there can be no assurance 
that our processes and strategies will be effective in avoiding 
losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial 
results. 

The value of our marketable and nonmarketable equity 
securities can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Marketable 
equity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains 
and losses reflected in earnings. Nonmarketable equity securities 
are carried under the cost method, equity method, or 
measurement alternative, while others are carried at fair value 
with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings. Earnings 
from our equity securities portfolio may be volatile and hard to 
predict, and may have a significant effect on our earnings from 
period to period. When, and if, we recognize gains may depend on 
a number of factors, including general economic and market 
conditions, the prospects of the companies in which we invest, 
when a company goes public, the size of our position relative to 
the public float, and whether we are subject to any resale 
restrictions. 

Nonmarketable equity securities include our private equity 
and venture capital investments that could result in significant 
OTTI losses for those investments carried under the 
measurement alternative or equity method. If we determine 
there is OTTI for an investment, we write-down the carrying 
value of the investment, resulting in a charge to earnings, which 
could be significant. 

For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management – Interest Rate Risk”, “– Mortgage 
Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk”, “– Market Risk – Trading 
Activities”, and “– Market Risk – Equity Securities” and the 
“Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities” sections in this Report and Note 4 
(Trading Activities), Note 5 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities) and Note 8 (Equity Securities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Uncertainty about the future of the London Interbank Offered 
Rate (LIBOR) may adversely affect our business, results of 
operations, and financial condition.  Due to uncertainty 
surrounding the suitability and sustainability of LIBOR, central 
banks and global regulators have called for financial market 
participants to prepare for the discontinuation of LIBOR by the 
end of 2021. We have a significant number of assets and 
liabilities referenced to LIBOR and other interbank offered rates 
such as commercial loans, adjustable-rate mortgage loans, 
derivatives, debt securities, and long-term debt. When any such 
benchmark rate or other referenced financial metric is 
significantly changed, replaced or discontinued, or ceases to be 
recognized as an acceptable market benchmark rate or financial 
metric, there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation 
of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on 
the terms of the governing instrument. 

This could impact the financial performance of previously 

booked transactions, result in losses on financial instruments we 
hold, require different hedging strategies or result in ineffective 
or increased basis risk on existing hedges, impact the overall 
interest rate environment and the availability or cost of floating-
rate funding, and affect our capital and liquidity planning and 
management. In addition, the transition to using any new 
benchmark rate or other financial metric may require changes to 

existing transaction data, products, systems, models, operations, 
and pricing processes, require substantial changes to existing 
documentation and the renegotiation of a substantial volume of 
previously booked transactions, and could result in significant 
operational, systems, or other practical challenges, increased 
compliance, legal and operational costs, heightened expectations 
and scrutiny from regulators, reputational harm, or other adverse 
consequences. Furthermore, the transition away from widely 
used benchmark rates like LIBOR could result in customers or 
other market participants challenging the determination of their 
interest payments, disputing the interpretation or 
implementation of contract “fallback” provisions and other 
transition related changes, or entering into fewer transactions or 
postponing their financing needs, which could reduce our 
revenue and adversely affect our business. Moreover, to the 
extent borrowers with loans referenced to LIBOR, such as 
adjustable rate mortgage loans, experience higher interest 
payments as a result of the transition to a new benchmark rate, 
our customers’ ability to repay their loans may be adversely 
affected, which can negatively impact our credit performance. 

For additional information on the discontinuation of LIBOR 
and the steps we are taking to address and mitigate the risks we 
have identified, refer to the “Risk Management - Asset/Liability 
Management - LIBOR Transition” section in this Report. 

Effective liquidity management, which ensures that we can 
meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/ 
withdrawals and other cash commitments, including principal 
and interest payments on our debt, efficiently under both 
normal operating conditions and other unpredictable 
circumstances of industry or financial market stress, is 
essential for the operation of our business, and our financial 
results and condition could be materially adversely affected if 
we do not effectively manage our liquidity.  Our liquidity is 
essential for the operation of our business. We primarily rely on 
bank deposits to be a low-cost and stable source of funding for 
the loans we make and the operation of our business. Customer 
deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-
bearing checking, savings certificates, certain market rate and 
other savings, and certain non-U.S. deposits, have historically 
provided us with a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost 
funds. In addition to customer deposits, our sources of liquidity 
include certain debt and equity securities, our ability to sell or 
securitize loans in secondary markets and to pledge loans to 
access secured borrowing facilities through the FHLB and the 
FRB, and our ability to raise funds in domestic and international 
money through capital markets. 

Our liquidity and our ability to fund and run our business 
could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions 
and factors, including financial and credit market disruption and 
volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial 
markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial 
crisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of 
customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or our 
inability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Market 
disruption and volatility could impact our credit spreads, which 
are the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury 
securities, or other benchmark securities, of the same maturity 
that we need to pay to our funding providers. Increases in 
interest rates and our credit spreads could significantly increase 
our funding costs. Other conditions and factors that could 
materially adversely affect our liquidity and funding include a lack 
of market or customer confidence in the Company or negative 
news about the Company or the financial services industry 
generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or 

Wells Fargo & Company 

105 

  
Risk Factors (continued) 

negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets; our 
inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; disruptions or 
volatility in the repurchase market which also may increase our 
short-term funding costs; and, as described below, reductions in 
one or more of our credit ratings. Many of the above conditions 
and factors may be caused by events over which we have little or 
no control. While market conditions have improved since the 
financial crisis, there can be no assurance that significant 
disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in 
the future. For example, concerns over geopolitical issues, 
commodity and currency prices, as well as global economic 
conditions, may cause financial market volatility. 

In addition, concerns regarding U.S. government debt levels 
and any associated downgrade of U.S. government debt ratings 
may cause uncertainty and volatility as well. A downgrade of the 
sovereign debt ratings of the U.S. government or the debt 
ratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, as 
well as other fiscal or political events could, in addition to causing 
economic and financial market disruptions, materially adversely 
affect the market value of the U.S. government securities that 
we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for 
borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable 
terms, as well as have other material adverse effects on the 
operation of our business and our financial results and condition. 
As noted above, we rely heavily on bank deposits for our 
funding and liquidity. We compete with banks and other financial 
services companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the 
rates they pay on deposits our funding costs may increase, either 
because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we 
lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of 
funding. Higher funding costs reduce our net interest margin and 
net interest income. Checking and savings account balances and 
other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers 
perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as 
providing a better risk/return tradeoff. When customers move 
money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we may 
lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding 
costs and negatively affecting our liquidity. 

If we are unable to continue to fund our assets through 
customer bank deposits or access capital markets on favorable 
terms or if we suffer an increase in our borrowing costs or 
otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively (including on an 
intraday basis), our liquidity, net interest margin, financial results 
and condition may be materially adversely affected. As we did 
during the financial crisis, we may also need, or be required by our 
regulators, to raise additional capital through the issuance of 
common stock, which could dilute the ownership of existing 
stockholders, or reduce or even eliminate our common stock 
dividend to preserve capital or in order to raise additional capital. 
For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – 

Asset/Liability Management” section in this Report. 

Adverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material 
adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, financial results and 
condition.  Our borrowing costs and ability to obtain funding are 
influenced by our credit ratings. Reductions in one or more of our 
credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow funds 
and raise the costs of our borrowings substantially and could 
cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral 
requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect 
our ability to raise funding. Credit ratings and credit ratings 
agencies’ outlooks are based on the ratings agencies’ analysis of 
many quantitative and qualitative factors, such as our capital 
adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and 
quality of our earnings, rating agency assumptions regarding the 

probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support, 
and other rating agency specific criteria. In addition to credit 
ratings, our borrowing costs are affected by various other 
external factors, including market volatility and concerns or 
perceptions about the financial services industry generally. There 
can be no assurance that we will maintain our credit ratings and 
outlooks and that credit ratings downgrades in the future would 
not materially affect our ability to borrow funds and borrowing 
costs. 

Downgrades in our credit ratings also may trigger additional 

collateral or funding obligations which could negatively affect 
our liquidity, including as a result of credit-related contingent 
features in certain of our derivative contracts. Although a one or 
two notch downgrade in our current credit ratings would not be 
expected to trigger a material increase in our collateral or 
funding obligations, a more severe credit rating downgrade of 
our long-term and short-term credit ratings could increase our 
collateral or funding obligations and the effect on our liquidity 
could be material. 

For information on our credit ratings, see the “Risk 
Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity and 
Funding – Credit Ratings” section and for information regarding 
additional collateral and funding obligations required of certain 
derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall 
below investment grade, see Note 18 (Derivatives) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and 
federal and state law, as well as certain contractual 
arrangements, can limit those dividends.  Wells Fargo & 
Company, the parent holding company (the “Parent”), is a 
separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives 
substantially all of its funding and liquidity from dividends and 
other distributions from its subsidiaries. We generally use these 
dividends and distributions, among other things, to pay 
dividends on our common and preferred stock and interest and 
principal on our debt. Federal and state laws limit the amount of 
dividends and distributions that our bank and some of our 
nonbank subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, 
may pay to the Parent. In addition, under a Support Agreement 
dated June 28, 2017, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019, 
among the Parent, WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding 
company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), Wells Fargo 
Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo Clearing 
Services, LLC, and certain other direct and indirect subsidiaries of 
the Parent designated as material entities for resolution planning 
purposes or identified as related support entities in our 
resolution plan, the IHC may be restricted from making dividend 
payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics 
fall below defined triggers or if the Parent’s board of directors 
authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Also, 
our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a 
subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior 
claims of the subsidiary’s creditors. 

For more information, refer to the “Regulation and 
Supervision – Dividend Restrictions” and “– Holding Company 
Structure” sections in our 2019 Form 10-K and to Note 3 (Cash, 
Loan and Dividend Restrictions) and Note 29 (Regulatory and 
Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements in this 
Report.

Wells Fargo & Company 

 
  
RISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM AND 
OTHER LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS 

Enacted legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-Frank 
Act, as well as future legislation and/or regulation, could 
require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce 
our revenue and earnings, impose additional costs on us or 
otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or 
competitive position.  Our parent company, our subsidiary 
banks and many of our nonbank subsidiaries such as those 
related to our brokerage and mutual fund businesses, are subject 
to significant and extensive regulation under state and federal 
laws in the U.S., as well as the applicable laws of the various 
jurisdictions outside of the U.S. where they conduct business. 
These regulations protect depositors, federal deposit insurance 
funds, consumers, investors, team members, and the banking 
and financial system as a whole, not necessarily our security 
holders. Economic, market and political conditions during the 
past few years have led to a significant amount of legislation and 
regulation in the U.S. and abroad affecting the financial services 
industry, as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of 
financial services companies from banking regulators. These laws 
and regulations may continue to affect the manner in which we 
do business and the products and services that we provide, affect 
or restrict our ability to compete in our current businesses or our 
ability to enter into or acquire new businesses, reduce or limit our 
revenue in businesses or impose additional fees, assessments or 
taxes on us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us and the 
financial services industry, and adversely affect our business 
operations or have other negative consequences. Our businesses 
and revenues in non-U.S. jurisdictions are also subject to risks 
from political, economic and social developments in those 
jurisdictions, including sanctions or business restrictions, asset 
freezes or confiscation, unfavorable political or diplomatic 
developments, or financial or social instability. In addition, 
greater government oversight and scrutiny of financial services 
companies has increased our operational and compliance costs as 
we must continue to devote substantial resources to enhancing 
our procedures and controls and meeting heightened regulatory 
standards and expectations. Any failure to meet regulatory 
requirements, standards or expectations, either in the U.S. or in 
non-U.S. jurisdictions, could result in fees, penalties, restrictions 
on our ability to engage in certain business activities, or other 
adverse consequences. 

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other 

things, imposes significant requirements and restrictions 
impacting the financial services industry, became law. The Dodd-
Frank Act has resulted in significant rulemaking by federal 
regulators, including the FRB, OCC, CFPB, FDIC, SEC and CFTC, 
which may continue to impact our business, including the types 
of products and services we can provide, the manner in which we 
operate our businesses, and our compliance and risk 
management activities. The Dodd-Frank Act, including the rules 
implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those 
rules, may continue to result in a loss of revenue, require us to 
change certain of our business practices, limit our ability to 
pursue certain business opportunities, increase our capital 
requirements and impose additional assessments and costs on 
us and otherwise adversely affect our business operations and 
have other negative consequences. 

Our consumer businesses, including our mortgage, 
automobile, credit card and other consumer lending and non-
lending businesses, are subject to numerous and, in many cases, 
highly complex consumer protection laws and regulations, as well 
as enhanced regulatory scrutiny and more and expanded 

regulatory examinations and/or investigations. In particular, the 
CFPB’s rules, which primarily impact our consumer businesses, 
may continue to increase our compliance costs and require 
changes in our business practices, which could limit or negatively 
affect the products and services that we offer our customers. If 
we fail to meet enhanced regulatory requirements and 
expectations with respect to our consumer businesses, we may 
be subject to increased costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our 
business activities including the products and services we can 
provide, and/or harm to our reputation. 

The Dodd-Frank Act’s proposed prohibitions or limitations 

on proprietary trading and private fund investment activities, 
known as the “Volcker Rule,” also may reduce our revenue. 
Federal banking regulators, the SEC and the CFTC jointly 
released a final rule to implement the Volcker Rule’s restrictions, 
and have adopted amendments to the rule to streamline and 
tailor the requirements for compliance. 

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established a 

comprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter 
derivatives and federal regulators, including the CFTC and SEC, 
have adopted rules regulating swaps, security-based swaps, 
derivatives activities, and other broker-dealer conduct and 
activities. These rules may continue to negatively impact 
customer demand for over-the-counter derivatives, impact our 
ability to offer customers new derivatives or amendments to 
existing derivatives, and increase our costs for engaging in swaps, 
security-based swaps, and other derivatives activities. Moreover, 
these rules may impact the manner in which we conduct business 
with customers seeking investment advice and may affect 
certain investment product offerings. 

We are also subject to various rules and regulations related 
to the prevention of financial crimes and combating terrorism, 
including the U.S. Patriot Act of 2001. These rules and 
regulations require us to, among other things, implement 
policies and procedures related to anti-money laundering, anti-
bribery and corruption, fraud, compliance, suspicious activities, 
currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. 
Although we have policies and procedures designed to comply 
with these rules and regulations, to the extent they are not fully 
effective or do not meet heightened regulatory standards or 
expectations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, restrictions 
on certain activities, reputational harm, or other adverse 
consequences. 

Our businesses are also subject to laws and regulations 
enacted by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators and governmental 
authorities relating to the privacy of the information of 
customers, team members and others. These laws and 
regulations, among other things, increase our compliance 
obligations; have a significant impact on our businesses’ 
collection, processing, sharing, use, and retention of personal 
data and reporting of data breaches; and provide for significantly 
increased penalties for non-compliance. 

In March 2017, we announced that the OCC had 

downgraded our most recent Community Reinvestment Act 
(CRA) rating, which covers the years 2009-2012, to “Needs to 
Improve” due to previously issued regulatory consent orders. A 
“Needs to Improve” rating imposes regulatory restrictions and 
limitations on certain of the Company’s nonbank activities, 
including its ability to engage in certain nonbank mergers and 
acquisitions or undertake new financial in nature activities, and 
CRA performance is taken into account by regulators in 
reviewing applications to establish bank branches and for 
approving proposed bank mergers and acquisitions. The rating 
also results in the loss of expedited processing of applications to 
undertake certain activities, and requires the Company to receive 

Wells Fargo & Company 

107 

Risk Factors (continued) 

prior regulatory approval for certain activities, including to issue 
or prepay certain subordinated debt obligations, open or relocate 
bank branches, or make certain public welfare investments. In 
addition, a “Needs to Improve” rating could have an impact on 
the Company’s relationships with certain states, counties, 
municipalities or other public agencies to the extent applicable 
law, regulation or policy limits, restricts or influences whether 
such entity may do business with a company that has a below 
“Satisfactory” rating. 

In addition, we are subject to consent orders with certain of 
our regulators, including a February 2018 consent order with the 
FRB regarding the Board’s governance and oversight of the 
Company, and the Company’s compliance and operational risk 
management program. The consent order limits the Company’s 
total consolidated assets to the level as of December 31, 2017, 
until certain conditions are met. This limitation could adversely 
affect our results of operations or financial condition. We are also 
subject to April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB and OCC 
regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program 
and past practices involving certain automobile collateral 
protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate 
lock extensions.

 Under the April 2018 consent order with the OCC, Wells 
Fargo Bank, N.A., remains subject to requirements that were 
originally imposed in November 2016 to provide prior written 
notice to, and obtain non-objection from, the OCC with respect 
to changes in directors and senior executive officers, and remains 
subject to certain regulatory limitations on post-termination 
payments to certain individuals and employees. 

The Company may be subject to further actions, including 

the imposition of consent orders or similar regulatory 
agreements or civil money penalties, by other federal regulators 
regarding similar issues, including the Company’s risk 
management policies and procedures. Compliance with the 
February 2018 FRB consent order, the April 2018 CFPB and OCC 
consent orders, and any other consent orders or regulatory 
actions, as well as the implementation of their requirements, 
may continue to increase the Company’s costs, require the 
Company to reallocate resources away from growing its existing 
businesses, and require the Company to undergo significant 
changes to its business, products and services. For more 
information on the February 2018 FRB consent order and the 
April 2018 CFPB and OCC consent orders, refer to the 
“Regulatory Matters” section in this Report. 

Other future regulatory initiatives that could significantly 

affect our business include proposals to reform the housing 
finance market in the United States. These proposals, among 
other things, consider ending the conservatorships of the GSEs 
and reducing or eliminating over time the role of the GSEs in 
buying mortgage loans or guaranteeing mortgage-backed 
securities (MBS), as well as the implementation of reforms 
relating to borrowers, lenders, and investors in the mortgage 
market. Regulatory changes to limit certain products, phase in a 
minimum down payment requirement for borrowers, tighten 
underwriting standards, or change the loan types and MBS pools 
included in the securitization process are also possible. Congress 
also may consider legislation to reform the mortgage finance 
market in an effort to assist borrowers experiencing difficulty 
making mortgage payments or refinancing their mortgages. The 
extent and timing of any regulatory reform or the adoption of 
any legislation regarding the GSEs and/or the home mortgage 
market, as well as any effect on the Company’s business and 
financial results, are uncertain. 

Any other future legislation and/or regulation, if adopted, 
also could significantly change our regulatory environment and 

increase our cost of doing business, limit the activities we may 
pursue or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings 
associations, credit unions, and other financial services 
companies, and have a material adverse effect on our financial 
results and condition. 

For more information on the significant regulations and 
regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect 
our business, refer to the “Regulatory Matters” section in this 
Report and the “Regulation and Supervision” section in our 2019 
Form 10-K. 

We could be subject to more stringent capital, leverage or 
liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities 
or operations if regulators determine that our resolution or 
recovery plan is deficient.  Pursuant to rules adopted by the FRB 
and the FDIC, Wells Fargo has prepared and submitted a 
resolution plan, also known as a “living will,” that is designed to 
facilitate our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material 
financial distress or failure. There can be no assurance that the 
FRB or FDIC will respond favorably to the Company’s resolution 
plans. If the FRB and/or FDIC determine that our resolution plan 
has deficiencies, they may impose more stringent capital, 
leverage or liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth, 
activities or operations until we adequately remedy the 
deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC ultimately determine that we 
have been unable to remedy any deficiencies, they could require 
us to divest certain assets or operations. On December 17, 2019, 
the FRB and FDIC announced that the Company’s 2019 
resolution plan did not have any deficiencies, but they identified 
a specific shortcoming that would need to be addressed. 

In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and 

submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a range of 
options that we may consider during times of idiosyncratic or 
systemic economic stress to remedy any financial weaknesses 
and restore market confidence without extraordinary 
government support. Our insured national bank subsidiary, Wells 
Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), must also prepare and submit to 
the OCC a recovery plan. If either the FRB or the OCC determines 
that our recovery plan is deficient, they may impose fines, 
restrictions on our business or ultimately require us to divest 
assets. 

Our security holders may suffer losses in a resolution of Wells 
Fargo, whether in a bankruptcy proceeding or under the 
orderly liquidation authority of the FDIC, even if creditors of 
our subsidiaries are paid in full.  If Wells Fargo were to fail, it 
may be resolved in a bankruptcy proceeding or, if certain 
conditions are met, under the resolution regime created by the 
Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly liquidation authority.” The 
orderly liquidation authority allows for the appointment of the 
FDIC as receiver for a systemically important financial institution 
that is in default or in danger of default if, among other things, 
the resolution of the institution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code 
would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the 
United States. If the FDIC is appointed as receiver for the Parent, 
then the orderly liquidation authority, rather than the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver 
and the rights and obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s 
orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a 
company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are 
exposed to any losses, and allows the FDIC to disregard the strict 
priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 
certain circumstances. 

The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is 
a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would likely 

108 

Wells Fargo & Company 

be the only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. 
However, we are not obligated to maintain a single point of entry 
strategy, and the strategy described in our resolution plan is not 
binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, 
whether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the 
FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC has 
announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a 
desirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly 
liquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might 
exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is 
possible. 

To facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important 
financial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal 
banking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, 
maintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to 
absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal 
banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the 
continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding 
the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on 
parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging 
institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital 
and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries in order to 
facilitate an orderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ 
guidance and to facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, 
on June 28, 2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, 
as amended and restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support 
Agreement”), with WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding 
company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, 
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing 
Services, LLC (“WFCS”), and certain other direct and indirect 
subsidiaries of the Parent designated as material entities for 
resolution planning purposes (the “Covered Entities”) or 
identified as related support entities in our resolution plan. 
Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the Parent transferred a 
significant amount of its assets, including the majority of its 
cash, deposits, liquid securities and intercompany loans (but 
excluding its equity interests in its subsidiaries and certain other 
assets), to the IHC and will continue to transfer those types of 
assets to the IHC from time to time. In the event of our material 
financial distress or failure, the IHC will be obligated to use the 
transferred assets to provide capital and/or liquidity to the Bank, 
WFS, WFCS, and the Covered Entities pursuant to the Support 
Agreement. Under the Support Agreement, the IHC will also 
provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through subordinated 
notes and a committed line of credit, which, together with the 
issuance of dividends, is expected to provide the Parent, during 
business as usual operating conditions, with the same access to 
cash necessary to service its debts, pay dividends, repurchase its 
shares, and perform its other obligations as it would have had if it 
had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any 
assets. If certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below 
defined triggers, or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it 
to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated 
notes would be forgiven, the committed line of credit would 
terminate, and the IHC’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent 
would be restricted, any of which could materially and adversely 
impact the Parent’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and 
other obligations, and could result in the commencement of 
bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than 
might have otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were 
not implemented. 

Any resolution of the Company will likely impose losses on 
shareholders, unsecured debt holders and other creditors of the 
Parent, while the Parent’s subsidiaries may continue to operate. 
Creditors of some or all of our subsidiaries may receive 

significant or full recoveries on their claims, while the Parent’s 
security holders could face significant or complete losses. This 
outcome may arise whether the Company is resolved under the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly 
liquidation authority, and whether the resolution is conducted 
using a single point of entry strategy or using a multiple point of 
entry strategy, in which the Parent and one or more of its 
subsidiaries would each undergo separate resolution 
proceedings. Furthermore, in a single point of entry or multiple 
point of entry strategy, losses at some or all of our subsidiaries 
could be transferred to the Parent and borne by the Parent’s 
security holders. Moreover, if either resolution strategy proved 
to be unsuccessful, our security holders could face greater losses 
than if the strategy had not been implemented. 

For more information, refer to the “Regulatory Matters - 
‘Living Will’ Requirements and Related Matters” section in this 
Report. 

Bank regulations, including Basel capital and liquidity 
standards and FRB guidelines and rules, may require higher 
capital and liquidity levels, limiting our ability to pay common 
stock dividends, repurchase our common stock, invest in our 
business, or provide loans or other products and services to our 
customers.  The Company and each of our insured depository 
institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy 
requirements administered by federal banking regulators. In 
particular, the Company is subject to rules issued by federal 
banking regulators to implement Basel III capital requirements 
for U.S. banking organizations. These capital rules, among other 
things, establish required minimum ratios relating capital to 
different categories of assets and exposures. Federal banking 
regulators have also finalized rules to impose a supplementary 
leverage ratio on large BHCs like Wells Fargo and our insured 
depository institutions. The FRB has also finalized rules to 
address the amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt a 
U.S. G-SIB must hold to improve its resolvability and resiliency, 
often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC). 
Similarly, federal banking regulators have issued a final rule that 
implements a liquidity coverage ratio. 

In addition, as part of its obligation to impose enhanced 
capital and risk-management standards on large financial firms 
pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB issued a final capital 
plan rule that requires large BHCs, including the Company, to 
submit annual capital plans for review and to obtain regulatory 
approval before making capital distributions. There can be no 
assurance that the FRB would respond favorably to the 
Company’s future capital plans. The FRB has also finalized a 
number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential 
requirements for large BHCs like Wells Fargo regarding risk-
based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, and 
imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators 
determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the 
United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules 
implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and 
national banks. The FRB has also finalized enhanced prudential 
standards that implement single counterparty credit limits, and 
has proposed a rule to establish remediation requirements for 
large BHCs experiencing financial distress. The OCC, under 
separate authority, has also established heightened governance 
and risk management standards for large national banks, such as 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. 

The Basel standards and federal regulatory capital and 
liquidity requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we 
utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock 
repurchases, and may require us to increase our capital and/or 

Wells Fargo & Company 

109 

Risk Factors (continued) 

liquidity. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory 
capital, regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, including as a result 
of business growth, acquisitions or a change in our risk profile, 
could require us to liquidate assets or otherwise change our 
business, product offerings and/or investment plans, which may 
negatively affect our financial results. Although not currently 
anticipated, proposed capital requirements and/or our regulators 
may require us to raise additional capital in the future. Issuing 
additional common stock may dilute the ownership of existing 
stockholders. In addition, federal banking regulations may 
continue to increase our compliance costs as well as limit our 
ability to invest in our business or provide loans or other 
products and services to our customers. 

For more information, refer to the “Capital Management,” 
“Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity and 
Funding – Liquidity Standards,” and “Regulatory Matters” 
sections in this Report and the “Regulation and Supervision” 
section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

FRB policies, including policies on interest rates, can 
significantly affect business and economic conditions and our 
financial results and condition.  The FRB regulates the supply of 
money in the United States. Its policies determine in large part 
our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we 
earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our 
net interest income and net interest margin. The FRB’s interest 
rate policies also can materially affect the value of financial 
instruments we hold, such as debt securities and MSRs. In 
addition, its policies can affect our borrowers, potentially 
increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. 
Changes in FRB policies, including its target range for the federal 
funds rate or actions taken to increase or decrease the size of its 
balance sheet, are beyond our control and can be hard to predict. 
The FRB has stated that in determining the timing and size of 
any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, 
the FRB will assess realized and expected economic conditions 
relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2% 
inflation. As noted above, a declining or low interest rate 
environment and a flattening yield curve which may result from 
the FRB’s actions could negatively affect our net interest income 
and net interest margin as it may result in us holding lower 
yielding loans and debt securities on our balance sheet. 

CREDIT RISK 

As one of the largest lenders in the U.S., increased credit risk, 
including as a result of a deterioration in economic conditions 
or changes in market conditions, could require us to increase 
our provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses 
and could have a material adverse effect on our results of 
operations and financial condition.  When we loan money or 
commit to loan money we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses if 
our borrowers do not repay their loans. As one of the largest 
lenders in the U.S., the credit performance of our loan portfolios 
significantly affects our financial results and condition. As noted 
above, if the current economic environment were to deteriorate, 
more of our customers may have difficulty in repaying their loans 
or other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit 
losses and provision for credit losses. We reserve for credit losses 
by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The 
amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of credit 
losses inherent in our loan portfolio (including unfunded credit 
commitments). The process for determining the amount of the 
allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It 
requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the 

future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that 
might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We 
might increase the allowance because of changing economic 
conditions, including falling home prices and higher 
unemployment, significant loan growth, changes in consumer 
behavior or other market conditions that adversely affect 
borrowers, or other factors. Additionally, the regulatory 
environment or external factors, such as natural disasters, 
disease pandemics, or political or social matters, also can 
influence recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and 
impact our allowance for credit losses. 

Future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a 
variety of factors, including loan growth, portfolio performance 
and general economic conditions. While we believe that our 
allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 
2019, there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover 
future credit losses, especially if housing and employment 
conditions worsen. In the event of significant deterioration in 
economic conditions or if we experience significant loan growth, 
we may be required to build reserves in future periods, which 
would reduce our earnings. 

For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – 
Credit Risk Management” and “Critical Accounting Policies – 
Allowance for Credit Losses” sections in this Report. 

We may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the 
extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry 
segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or 
collateral.  Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our 
loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or 
similar activities or to borrowers who individually or as a group 
may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or 
market conditions. Similarly, challenging economic or market 
conditions, or trade policies, affecting a particular industry or 
geography may also impact related or dependent industries or 
the ability of borrowers living in such affected areas or working in 
such industries to meet their financial obligations. We 
experienced the effect of concentration risk in 2009 and 2010 
when we incurred greater than expected losses in our residential 
real estate loan portfolio due to a housing slowdown and greater 
than expected deterioration in residential real estate values in 
many markets, including the Central Valley California market and 
several Southern California metropolitan statistical areas. As 
California is our largest banking state in terms of loans and 
deposits, deterioration in real estate values and underlying 
economic conditions in those markets or elsewhere in California 
could result in materially higher credit losses. In addition, 
changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions, such 
as in response to climate change and other environmental and 
sustainability concerns, may adversely affect borrowers in certain 
industries or sectors, which may increase our credit risk and 
reduce the demand by these borrowers for our products and 
services. Moreover, deterioration in macro-economic conditions 
generally across the country could result in materially higher 
credit losses, including for our residential real estate loan 
portfolio, which includes nonconforming mortgage loans we 
retain on our balance sheet. We may experience higher 
delinquencies and higher loss rates as our consumer real estate 
secured lines of credit reach their contractual end of draw period 
and begin to amortize. 

We are currently one of the largest CRE lenders in the U.S. A 
deterioration in economic conditions that negatively affects the 
business performance of our CRE borrowers, including increases 
in interest rates, declines in commercial property values, and/or 
changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions, could 

110 

Wells Fargo & Company 

 
 
 
 
result in materially higher credit losses and have a material 
adverse effect on our financial results and condition. 

Challenges and/or changes in non-U.S. economic conditions 
may increase our non-U.S. credit risk. Our non-U.S. loan exposure 
represented approximately 8% of our total consolidated 
outstanding loans and 4% of our total assets at December 31, 
2019. Economic difficulties in non-U.S. jurisdictions could also 
indirectly have a material adverse effect on our credit 
performance and results of operations and financial condition to 
the extent they negatively affect the U.S. economy and/or our 
borrowers who have non-U.S. operations. 

Due to regulatory requirements, we must clear certain 

derivative transactions through central counterparty 
clearinghouses (CCPs), which results in credit exposure to these 
CCPs. Similarly, because we are a member of various CCPs, we 
may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the 
CCP in the event that one or more members of the CCP defaults 
on its obligations. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of non-
performance by our clients for which we clear transactions 
through CCPs to the extent such non-performance is not 
sufficiently covered by available collateral. 

In order to reduce credit risk and obtain additional funding, 

from time to time we may securitize or sell similar types or 
categories of loans that we originate, such as mortgage loans 
and automobile loans. The agreements under which we do this 
generally contain various representations and warranties 
regarding the origination and characteristics of the loans. We 
may be required to repurchase the loans, reimburse investors 
and others, or incur other losses, including regulatory fines and 
penalties, as a result of any breaches in these contractual 
representations and warranties. For more information about our 
repurchase obligations with respect to mortgage loans, refer to 
the “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Mortgage Business” 
section in this Report. 

For more information regarding credit risk, refer to the “Risk 

Management – Credit Risk Management” section and Note 6 
(Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

OPERATIONAL AND LEGAL RISK 

A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, 
controls or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors 
and other service providers, could disrupt our businesses, 
damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.  As 
a large financial institution that serves customers through 
numerous physical locations, ATMs, the internet, mobile banking 
and other distribution channels across the U.S. and 
internationally, we depend on our ability to process, record and 
monitor a large number of customer transactions on a 
continuous basis. As our customer base and locations have 
expanded throughout the U.S. and internationally, as we have 
increasingly used the internet and mobile banking to provide 
products and services to our customers, and as customer, public, 
legislative and regulatory expectations regarding operational and 
information security have increased, our operational systems, 
controls and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and 
monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. 
Our business, financial, accounting, data processing systems or 
other operating systems and facilities may stop operating 
properly, become insufficient based on our evolving business 
needs, or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of 
factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our 
control. For example, there could be sudden increases in 
customer transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications 

outages; degradation or loss of internet, website or mobile 
banking availability; climate change related impacts and natural 
disasters such as earthquakes, tornados, and hurricanes; disease 
pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or 
social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, 
cyber attacks or other information security breaches. 
Furthermore, enhancements and upgrades to our infrastructure 
or operating systems may be time-consuming, entail significant 
costs, and create risks associated with implementing new 
systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the 
complexity and interconnectedness of our systems, the process 
of enhancing our infrastructure and operating systems, including 
their security measures and controls, can itself create a risk of 
system disruptions and security issues. Similarly, we may not be 
able to timely recover critical business processes or operations 
that have been disrupted, which may further increase any 
associated costs and consequences of such disruptions. Although 
we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place 
to help provide operational resiliency, our business operations 
may be adversely affected by significant and widespread 
disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems 
that support our businesses and customers. For example, on 
February 7, 2019, we experienced system issues caused by an 
automatic power shutdown at one of our main data center 
facilities. Although applications and related workloads were 
systematically re-routed to back-up data centers throughout the 
day, certain of our services, including our online and mobile 
banking systems, certain mortgage origination systems, and 
certain ATM functions, experienced disruptions that delayed 
service to our customers. 

As a result of financial institutions and technology systems 

becoming more interconnected and complex, any operational 
incident at a third party may increase the risk of loss or material 
impact to us or the financial industry as a whole. Furthermore, 
third parties on which we rely, including those that facilitate our 
business activities or to which we outsource operations, such as 
exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors 
that provide services or security solutions for our operations, 
could also be sources of operational risk to us, including from 
information breaches or loss, breakdowns, disruptions or failures 
of their own systems or infrastructure, or any deficiencies in the 
performance of their responsibilities. We are also exposed to the 
risk that a disruption or other operational incident at a common 
service provider to those third parties could impede their ability 
to provide services or perform their responsibilities for us. In 
addition, we must meet regulatory requirements and 
expectations regarding our use of third-party service providers, 
and any failure by our third-party service providers to meet their 
obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws, rules, 
regulations, or Wells Fargo policies could result in fines, penalties, 
restrictions on our business, or other negative consequences. 

Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure, controls 

or operating systems that support our businesses and 
customers, failures of the third parties on which we rely to 
adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform 
their responsibilities, or our failure to effectively manage or 
oversee our third-party relationships, could result in business 
disruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory 
proceedings, compliance and other costs, violations of applicable 
privacy and other laws, reputational damage, or other adverse 
consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our 
results of operations or financial condition.

Risk Factors (continued) 

A cyber attack or other information security breach of our 
technologies, computer systems or networks, or those of our 
third-party vendors and other service providers, could disrupt 
our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of 
confidential or proprietary information, damage our 
reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.  Information 
security risks for large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo 
have generally increased in recent years in part because of the 
proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet, mobile 
devices, and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, 
and the increased sophistication and activities of organized 
crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, 
including foreign state-sponsored parties. Those parties also 
may continue to attempt to misrepresent personal or financial 
information to obtain loans or other financial products from us 
or attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or 
other users of our systems to disclose confidential information in 
order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. As 
noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, 
transmission and storage of confidential information in our 
computer systems and networks. Our banking, brokerage, 
investment advisory, and capital markets businesses rely on our 
digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, 
hardware, and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, 
to access our products and services, our customers may use 
personal smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are 
beyond our control systems. Although we believe we have robust 
information security procedures and controls, our technologies, 
systems, networks, and our customers’ devices may become the 
target of cyber attacks or other information security breaches 
that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, 
monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Wells Fargo’s or our 
customers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, or 
otherwise disrupt Wells Fargo’s or its customers’ or other third 
parties’ business operations. For example, various retailers have 
reported they were victims of cyber attacks in which large 
amounts of their customers’ data, including debit and credit card 
information, was obtained. In these situations, we generally incur 
costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent 
transaction activity affecting our customers. We are also 
exposed to the risk that a team member or other person acting 
on behalf of the Company fails to comply with applicable policies 
and procedures and inappropriately circumvents controls for 
personal gain or other improper purposes. 

Due to the increasing interconnectedness and complexity of 

financial institutions and technology systems, an information 
security incident at a third party may increase the risk of loss or 
material impact to us or the financial industry as a whole. In 
addition, third parties on which we rely, including those that 
facilitate our business activities or to which we outsource 
operations, such as internet, mobile technology and cloud service 
providers, could be sources of information security risk to us. If 
those third parties fail to adequately or appropriately safeguard 
their technologies, systems, and networks, we may suffer 
material harm, including business disruptions, losses or 
remediation costs, reputational damage, legal or regulatory 
proceedings, or other adverse consequences. 

To date we have not experienced any material losses relating 

to cyber attacks or other information security breaches, but 
there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in 
the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains 
heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature 
of these threats, the prominent size and scale of Wells Fargo and 
its role in the financial services industry, our plans to continue to 
implement our digital and mobile banking channel strategies and 

develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our 
customers when and how they want to be served, our expanded 
geographic footprint and international presence, the outsourcing 
of some of our business operations, and the current global 
economic and political environment. For example, Wells Fargo 
and other financial institutions continue to be the target of 
various evolving and adaptive cyber attacks, including malware 
and denial-of-service, as part of an effort to disrupt the 
operations of financial institutions, potentially test their 
cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, 
proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks have also 
focused on targeting online applications and services, such as 
online banking, as well as cloud-based services provided by third 
parties, and have targeted the infrastructure of the internet, 
causing the widespread unavailability of websites and degrading 
website performance. As a result, information security and the 
continued development and enhancement of our controls, 
processes and systems designed to protect our networks, 
computers, software and data from attack, damage or 
unauthorized access remain a priority for Wells Fargo. We are 
also proactively involved in industry cybersecurity efforts and 
working with other parties, including our third-party service 
providers and governmental agencies, to continue to enhance 
defenses and improve resiliency to cybersecurity and other 
information security threats. As these threats continue to evolve, 
we may continue to be required to expend significant additional 
resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective 
measures or to investigate and remediate any information 
security vulnerabilities or incidents. Because the investigation of 
any information security breach is inherently unpredictable and 
would require time to complete, we may not be able to 
immediately address the consequences of a breach, which may 
further increase any associated costs and consequences. 
Moreover, to the extent our insurance covers aspects of 
information security risk, such insurance may not be sufficient to 
cover all losses associated with an information security breach. 
Cyber attacks or other information security breaches 
affecting us or third parties on which we rely, including those that 
facilitate our business activities or to which we outsource 
operations, or security breaches of the networks, systems or 
devices that our customers use to access our products and 
services, could result in business disruptions, loss of revenue or 
customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, compliance and 
other costs, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, 
reputational damage, or other adverse consequences, any of 
which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
or financial condition. 

Our framework for managing risks may not be fully effective in 
mitigating risk and loss to us.  Our risk management framework 
seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established 
processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, 
monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are 
subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest 
rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and 
reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk 
management framework, there are inherent limitations to our 
risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the 
future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated, 
identified or managed. Our risk management framework is also 
dependent on ensuring that effective operational controls and a 
sound culture exist throughout the Company. The inability to 
develop effective operational controls or to foster the 
appropriate culture in each of our lines of business, including the 
inability to align performance management and compensation to 

112 

Wells Fargo & Company 

achieve the desired culture, could adversely impact the 
effectiveness of our risk management framework. Similarly, if we 
are unable to effectively manage our business or operations, we 
may be exposed to increased risks or unexpected losses. We are 
also exposed to risks if we do not accurately or completely 
execute a process or transaction, whether due to human error or 
otherwise, or if a team member fails to comply with applicable 
policies and procedures or inappropriately circumvents controls. 
In certain instances, we rely on models to measure, monitor and 
predict risks, such as market and interest rate risks, as well as to 
help inform business decisions; however, there is no assurance 
that these models will appropriately or sufficiently capture all 
relevant risks or accurately predict future events or exposures. 
Furthermore, certain of our models are subject to regulatory 
review and approval, and any failure to meet regulatory 
standards or expectations could result in fines, penalties, 
restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities, 
or other adverse consequences, and any required modifications 
or changes to these models can impact our capital ratios and 
requirements and result in increased operational and compliance 
costs. In addition, we rely on data to aggregate and assess our 
various risk exposures and business activities, and any issues with 
the quality or effectiveness of our data, including our 
aggregation, management, and validation procedures, could 
result in ineffective risk management practices, business 
decisions or customer service, inefficient use of resources, or 
inaccurate regulatory or other risk reporting. We also use 
artificial intelligence to help further inform our business 
decisions and risk management practices, but there is no 
assurance that artificial intelligence will appropriately or 
sufficiently replicate certain outcomes or accurately predict 
future events or exposures. The recent financial and credit crisis 
and resulting regulatory reform highlighted both the importance 
and some of the limitations of managing unanticipated risks, and 
our regulators remain focused on ensuring that financial 
institutions build and maintain robust risk management policies 
and practices. If our risk management framework proves 
ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses which could 
materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial 
condition. 

Risks related to sales practices and other instances where 
customers may have experienced financial harm. Various 
government entities and offices have undertaken formal or 
informal inquiries, investigations or examinations arising out of 
certain sales practices of the Company that were the subject of 
settlements with the CFPB, the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney 
announced by the Company on September 8, 2016. In addition 
to imposing monetary penalties and other sanctions, regulatory 
authorities may require admissions of wrongdoing and 
compliance with other conditions in connection with such 
matters, which can lead to restrictions on our ability to engage in 
certain business activities or offer certain products or services, 
limitations on our ability to access capital markets, limitations on 
capital distributions, the loss of customers, and/or other direct 
and indirect adverse consequences. A number of lawsuits have 
also been filed by non-governmental parties seeking damages or 
other remedies related to these sales practices. The ultimate 
resolution of any of these pending legal proceedings or 
government investigations, depending on the sanctions and 
remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our 
results of operations and financial condition. We may continue to 
incur additional costs and expenses in order to address and 
defend these pending legal proceedings and government 

investigations, and we may continue to have increased 
compliance and other costs related to these matters. 
Furthermore, negative publicity or public opinion resulting from 
these matters may increase the risk of reputational harm to our 
business, which can impact our ability to keep and attract 
customers, affect our ability to attract and retain qualified team 
members, result in the loss of revenue, or have other material 
adverse effects on our results of operations and financial 
condition. 

Furthermore, our priority of rebuilding trust has included an 

ongoing effort to identify other areas or instances where 
customers may have experienced financial harm. For example, we 
have identified certain issues related to past practices involving 
certain automobile collateral protection insurance policies and 
certain issues related to the unused portion of guaranteed 
automobile protection waiver or insurance agreements. The 
identification of such other areas or instances where customers 
may have experienced financial harm could lead to, and in some 
cases has already resulted in, additional remediation costs, loss 
of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, 
compliance and other costs, reputational damage, or other 
adverse consequences. 

For more information, refer to the “Overview – Retail Sales 

Practices Matters” and “– Other Customer Remediation 
Activities” sections and Note 17 (Legal Actions) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

We may incur fines, penalties and other negative 
consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even 
inadvertent or unintentional violations, or from any failure to 
meet regulatory standards or expectations.  We maintain 
systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with 
applicable laws and regulations. However, we are subject to 
heightened compliance and regulatory oversight and 
expectations, particularly due to the evolving and increasing 
regulatory landscape we operate in. We are also subject to 
consent orders with regulators that subject us to various 
conditions and restrictions. In addition, a single event or issue 
may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and 
proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in the 
U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in 
different jurisdictions. Also, the laws and regulations in 
jurisdictions in which we operate may be different or even 
conflict with each other, such as differences between U.S. federal 
and state law or differences between U.S. and non-U.S. laws as to 
the products and services we may offer or other business 
activities we may engage in, which can lead to compliance 
difficulties or issues. Furthermore, many legal and regulatory 
regimes require us to report transactions and other information 
to regulators and other governmental authorities, self-
regulatory organizations, exchanges, clearing houses and 
customers. We may be subject to fines, penalties, restrictions on 
our business, or other negative consequences if we do not timely, 
completely, or accurately provide regulatory reports, customer 
notices or disclosures. Moreover, some legal/regulatory 
frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for 
noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent 
or unintentional and even though there was in place at the time 
systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance. For 
example, we are subject to regulations issued by the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) that prohibit financial institutions 
from participating in the transfer of property belonging to the 
governments of certain non-U.S. countries and designated 
nationals of those countries. OFAC may impose penalties or 
restrictions on certain activities for inadvertent or unintentional 

Wells Fargo & Company 

113 

 
Risk Factors (continued) 

violations even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent 
the violations. Any violation of these or other applicable laws or 
regulatory requirements, even if inadvertent or unintentional, or 
any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations, 
including any failure to satisfy the conditions of any consent 
orders, could result in fees, penalties, restrictions on our ability to 
engage in certain business activities, reputational harm, loss of 
customers or other negative consequences. 

Reputational harm, including as a result of our actual or alleged 
conduct or public opinion of the financial services industry 
generally, could adversely affect our business, results of 
operations, and financial condition.  Reputation risk, or the risk 
to our business, earnings and capital from negative public 
opinion, is inherent in our business and has increased 
substantially because of the financial crisis, our size and profile in 
the financial services industry, and sales practices related 
matters and other instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm. Negative public opinion about the 
financial services industry generally or Wells Fargo specifically 
could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to keep and 
attract customers. Negative public opinion could result from our 
actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including 
sales practices; mortgage, automobile or other consumer lending 
practices; loan origination or servicing activities; mortgage 
foreclosure actions; management of client accounts or 
investments; lending, investing or other business relationships; 
identification and management of potential conflicts of interest 
from transactions, obligations and interests with and among our 
customers; corporate governance; regulatory compliance; risk 
management; incentive compensation practices; and disclosure, 
sharing or inadequate protection or improper use of customer 
information, and from actions taken by government regulators 
and community or other organizations in response to that 
conduct. Although we have policies and procedures in place 
intended to detect and prevent conduct by team members and 
third-party service providers that could potentially harm 
customers or our reputation, there is no assurance that such 
policies and procedures will be fully effective in preventing such 
conduct. Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address 
or prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage 
our business or operations could result in significant reputational 
harm. In addition, because we conduct most of our businesses 
under the “Wells Fargo” brand, negative public opinion about one 
business also could affect our other businesses. Moreover, 
actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain 
members or individuals in the industry also can adversely affect 
our reputation. The proliferation of social media websites utilized 
by Wells Fargo and other third parties, as well as the personal use 
of social media by our team members and others, including 
personal blogs and social network profiles, also may increase the 
risk that negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information 
may be posted or released publicly that could harm our 
reputation or have other negative consequences, including as a 
result of our team members interacting with our customers in an 
unauthorized manner in various social media outlets. 

Wells Fargo and other financial institutions have been 
targeted from time to time by protests and demonstrations, 
which have included disrupting the operation of our retail 
banking locations and have resulted in negative public 
commentary about financial institutions, including the fees 
charged for various products and services. Wells Fargo and other 
financial institutions have also been subject to negative publicity 
as a result of providing financial services to or making 
investments in industries or organizations subject to stakeholder 

concerns. There can be no assurance that continued protests or 
negative public opinion of the Company specifically or large 
financial institutions generally will not harm our reputation and 
adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial 
condition. 

Risks related to legal actions.  Wells Fargo and some of its 
subsidiaries are involved in judicial, regulatory, governmental, 
arbitration, and other proceedings or investigations concerning 
matters arising from the conduct of our business activities, and 
many of those proceedings and investigations expose Wells 
Fargo to potential financial loss. Although we believe we have a 
meritorious defense in all significant legal actions pending 
against us, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate 
outcome. We establish accruals for legal actions when potential 
losses associated with the actions become probable and the 
costs can be reasonably estimated. We may still incur costs for a 
legal action even if we have not established an accrual. In 
addition, the actual cost of resolving a legal action may be 
substantially higher than any amounts accrued for that action. 
The ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding or 
investigation, depending on the remedy sought and granted, 
could materially adversely affect our results of operations and 
financial condition. 

As noted above, we are subject to heightened regulatory 

oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to regulatory 
investigations, proceedings or enforcement actions. In addition 
to imposing monetary penalties and other sanctions, regulatory 
authorities may require criminal pleas or other admissions of 
wrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection 
with settling such matters, which can lead to reputational harm, 
loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access capital 
markets, limitations on capital distributions, the inability to 
engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or 
services, and/or other direct and indirect adverse effects. 

For more information, refer to Note 17 (Legal Actions) to 

Financial Statements in this Report. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR MORTGAGE BUSINESS 

Our mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to 
quarter, including from the impact of changes in interest rates 
on our origination activity and on the value of our MSRs, 
MLHFS and associated economic hedges, and we rely on the 
GSEs to purchase our conforming loans to reduce our credit 
risk and provide liquidity to fund new mortgage loans.  We are 
one of the largest mortgage originators and residential 
mortgage servicers in the U.S., and we earn revenue from fees we 
receive for originating mortgage loans and for servicing 
mortgage loans. As a result of our mortgage servicing business, 
we have a sizable portfolio of MSRs, which we initially measure 
and carry using the fair value measurement method. Fair value is 
the present value of estimated future net servicing income, 
calculated based on a number of variables, including assumptions 
about the likelihood of prepayment by borrowers. Changes in 
interest rates can affect prepayment assumptions and thus fair 
value. When interest rates fall, borrowers are usually more likely 
to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a lower 
rate. As the likelihood of prepayment increases, the fair value of 
our MSRs can decrease. Each quarter we evaluate the fair value 
of our MSRs, and any decrease in fair value reduces earnings in 
the period in which the decrease occurs. We also measure at fair 
value MLHFS for which an active secondary market and readily 
available market prices exist. In addition, we measure at fair value 
certain other interests we hold related to residential loan sales 

114 

Wells Fargo & Company 

and securitizations. Similar to other interest-bearing securities, 
the value of these MLHFS and other interests may be negatively 
affected by changes in interest rates. For example, if market 
interest rates increase relative to the yield on these MLHFS and 
other interests, their fair value may fall. 

When rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans usually 

tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from loan 
originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our MSRs 
can increase through increases in fair value. When rates fall, 
mortgage originations usually tend to increase and the value of 
our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with some offsetting 
revenue effect. Even though they can act as a “natural hedge,” 
the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. For example, 
the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value 
of residential MSRs is generally immediate, but any offsetting 
revenue benefit from more originations and the MSRs relating to 
the new loans would generally accrue over time. It is also possible 
that, because of economic conditions and/or a weak or 
deteriorating housing market, even if interest rates were to fall 
or remain low, mortgage originations may also fall or any 
increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset 
the decrease in the MSRs value caused by the lower rates. 

We typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge 
our mortgage banking interest rate risk. We may not hedge all of 
our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. 
Hedging is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models 
and constant monitoring, and is not a perfect science. We may 
use hedging instruments that may not perfectly correlate with 
the value or income being hedged. We could incur significant 
losses from our hedging activities. There may be periods where 
we elect not to use derivatives and other instruments to hedge 
mortgage banking interest rate risk. 

We rely on the GSEs to purchase mortgage loans that meet 
their conforming loan requirements and on the Federal Housing 
Authority (FHA) to insure loans that meet their policy 
requirements. In order to meet customer needs, we also 
originate loans that do not conform to either the GSEs or FHA 
standards, which are referred to as “nonconforming” loans. We 
generally retain these nonconforming loans on our balance sheet. 
When we retain a loan on our balance sheet not only do we keep 
the credit risk of the loan but we also do not receive any sale 
proceeds that could be used to generate new loans. If we were 
unable or unwilling to retain nonconforming loans on our balance 
sheet, whether due to regulatory, business or other reasons, our 
ability to originate new nonconforming loans may be reduced, 
thereby reducing the interest income we could earn from these 
loans. Similarly, if the GSEs or FHA were to limit or reduce their 
purchases or insuring of loans, our ability to fund, and thus 
originate new mortgage loans, could also be reduced. We cannot 
assure that the GSEs or FHA will not materially limit their 
purchases or insuring of conforming loans or change their criteria 
for what constitutes a conforming loan (e.g., maximum loan 
amount or borrower eligibility). Each of the GSEs is currently in 
conservatorship, with its primary regulator, the Federal Housing 
Finance Agency (FHFA) acting as conservator. While the FHFA 
has stated that it intends to end the conservatorship, we cannot 
predict if, when or precisely how the conservatorship will end, or 
any associated changes to the GSEs business structure and 
operations that could result. As noted above, there are various 
proposals to reform the housing finance market in the U.S., 
including the role of the GSEs in the housing finance market. The 
impact of any such regulatory reform regarding the housing 
finance market and the GSEs, including any changes to the GSE’s 
structure, capital requirements, or market presence, as well as 

any effect on the Company’s business and financial results, are 
uncertain. 

For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate 
and Market Risk,” “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of 
Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights” and “Critical Accounting 
Policies - Fair Value of Financial Instruments” sections in this 
Report. 

We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or 
reimburse investors and others as a result of breaches in 
contractual representations and warranties, and we may incur 
other losses as a result of real or alleged violations of statutes 
or regulations applicable to the origination of our residential 
mortgage loans.  We often sell residential mortgage loans that 
we originate to various parties, including GSEs, SPEs that issue 
private label MBS, and other financial institutions that purchase 
mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. We 
may also pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgage loans 
which back securities guaranteed by GNMA. The agreements 
under which we sell mortgage loans and the insurance or 
guaranty agreements with the FHA and VA contain various 
representations and warranties regarding the origination and 
characteristics of the mortgage loans. We may be required to 
repurchase mortgage loans, indemnify the securitization trust, 
investor or insurer, or reimburse the securitization trust, investor 
or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a 
breach of contractual representations or warranties that is not 
remedied within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we 
receive notice of the breach. We establish a mortgage repurchase 
liability related to the various representations and warranties 
that reflect management’s estimate of losses for loans which we 
have a repurchase obligation. Because the level of mortgage loan 
repurchase losses depends upon economic factors, investor 
demand strategies and other external conditions that may 
change over the life of the underlying loans, the level of the 
liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is difficult to 
estimate, requires considerable management judgment, and is 
subject to change. If economic conditions or the housing market 
worsen or future investor repurchase demand and our success at 
appealing repurchase requests differ from past experience, we 
could have increased repurchase obligations and increased loss 
severity on repurchases, requiring significant additions to the 
repurchase liability. 

Additionally, for residential mortgage loans that we 

originate, borrowers may allege that the origination of the loans 
did not comply with applicable laws or regulations in one or more 
respects and assert such violation as an affirmative defense to 
payment or to the exercise by us of our remedies, including 
foreclosure proceedings, or in an action seeking statutory and 
other damages in connection with such violation. If we are not 
successful in demonstrating that the loans in dispute were 
originated in accordance with applicable statutes and 
regulations, we could become subject to monetary damages and 
other civil penalties, including the loss of certain contractual 
payments or the inability to exercise certain remedies under the 
loans.

Risk Factors (continued) 

We may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer, be 
required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors 
for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, 
fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing 
obligations, including our obligations with respect to 
mortgage loan foreclosure actions.  We act as servicer and/or 
master servicer for mortgage loans included in securitizations 
and for unsecuritized mortgage loans owned by investors. As a 
servicer or master servicer for those loans we have certain 
contractual obligations to the securitization trusts, investors or 
other third parties, including certain foreclosure obligations or, if 
applicable, considering alternatives to foreclosure such as loan 
modifications or short-sales, as well as certain servicing 
obligations for properties that fall within a flood zone. If we fail 
to satisfy our servicing obligations, we may face a number of 
consequences, including termination as servicer or master 
servicer, requirements to indemnify the securitization trustee 
against losses from any failure by us to perform our servicing 
obligations, and/or contractual obligations to repurchase a 
mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses, any of 
which could significantly reduce our net servicing income. 

We may incur costs, liabilities to borrowers, title insurers 

and/or securitization investors, legal proceedings, or other 
adverse consequences if we fail to meet our obligations with 
respect to mortgage foreclosure actions or we experience delays 
in the foreclosure process. Our net servicing income and the fair 
value of our MSRs may be negatively affected to the extent our 
servicing costs increase because of higher foreclosure or other 
servicing related costs. We may be subject to fines and other 
sanctions imposed by federal or state regulators as a result of 
actual or perceived deficiencies in our mortgage servicing 
practices, including with respect to our foreclosure practices or 
our servicing of flood zone properties. Any of these actions may 
harm our reputation, negatively affect our residential mortgage 
origination or servicing business, or result in material fines, 
penalties, equitable remedies, or other enforcement actions.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY’S COMPETITIVE 
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT 

We face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly 
evolving financial services industry.  We compete with other 
financial institutions in a highly competitive industry that is 
undergoing significant changes as a result of financial regulatory 
reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny 
stemming from the financial crisis, and current economic 
conditions. Our success depends on our ability to develop and 
maintain deep and enduring relationships with our customers 
based on the quality of our customer service, the wide variety of 
products and services that we can offer our customers and the 
ability of those products and services to satisfy our customers’ 
needs and preferences, the pricing of our products and services, 
the extensive distribution channels available for our customers, 
our innovation, and our reputation. Continued or increased 
competition in any one or all of these areas may negatively affect 
our customer relationships, market share and results of 
operations and/or cause us to increase our capital investment in 
our businesses in order to remain competitive. In addition, our 

ability to reposition or reprice our products and services from 
time to time may be limited and could be influenced significantly 
by the current economic, regulatory and political environment 
for large financial institutions as well as by the actions of our 
competitors. Furthermore, any changes in the types of products 
and services that we offer our customers and/or the pricing for 
those products and services could result in a loss of customer 
relationships and market share and could materially adversely 
affect our results of operations. 

Continued technological advances and the growth of  

e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository 
institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were 
banking products, and for financial institutions and other 
companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial 
solutions, including electronic securities trading, lending and 
payment solutions. In addition, technological advances, including 
digital currencies, may diminish the importance of depository 
institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of 
funds between parties. We may not respond effectively to these 
and other competitive threats from existing and new 
competitors and may be forced to sell products at lower prices, 
increase our investment in our business to modify or adapt our 
existing products and services, and/or develop new products and 
services to respond to our customers’ needs and preferences. To 
the extent we are not successful in developing and introducing 
new products and services or responding or adapting to the 
competitive landscape or to changes in customer preferences, 
we may lose customer relationships and our revenue growth and 
results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 

Our ability to attract and retain qualified team members is 
critical to the success of our business and failure to do so could 
adversely affect our business performance, competitive 
position and future prospects.  The success of Wells Fargo is 
heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of our team 
members, including our senior leaders, and in many areas of our 
business, including commercial banking, brokerage, investment 
advisory, capital markets, risk management and technology, the 
competition for highly qualified personnel is intense. We also 
seek to retain a pipeline of team members to provide continuity 
of succession for our senior leadership positions. In order to 
attract and retain highly qualified team members, we must 
provide competitive compensation and effectively manage team 
member performance and development. As a large financial 
institution and additionally to the extent we remain subject to 
consent orders we may be subject to limitations on 
compensation by our regulators that may adversely affect our 
ability to attract and retain these qualified team members, 
especially if some of our competitors may not be subject to 
these same compensation limitations. If we are unable to 
continue to attract and retain qualified team members, including 
successors for senior leadership positions, our business 
performance, competitive position and future prospects may be 
adversely affected. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Changes in accounting policies or accounting standards, and 
changes in how accounting standards are interpreted or 
applied, could materially affect how we report our financial 
results and condition.  Our accounting policies are fundamental 
to determining and understanding our financial results and 
condition. As described below, some of these policies require use 
of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our 
assets or liabilities and financial results. Any changes in our 

116 

Wells Fargo & Company 

 
  
accounting policies could materially affect our financial 
statements. 

From time to time the FASB and the SEC change the 
financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the 
preparation of our external financial statements. For example, on 
January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 
2016-13 – Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which 
replaced the previous “incurred loss” model for the allowance for 
credit losses with an “expected loss” model referred to as the 
Current Expected Credit Loss model, or CECL. 

In addition, accounting standard setters and those who 
interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, 
banking regulators and our outside auditors) may change or even 
reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these 
standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and 
reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may 
be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could 
materially affect how we report our financial results and 
condition. We may be required to apply a new or revised standard 
retroactively or apply an existing standard differently, also 
retroactively, in each case potentially resulting in our restating 
prior period financial statements in material amounts. 

For more information, including information on our adoption 

of CECL, refer to the “Current Accounting Developments” 
section in this Report. 

Our financial statements are based in part on assumptions and 
estimates which, if wrong, could cause unexpected losses in 
the future, and our financial statements depend on our 
internal controls over financial reporting.  Pursuant to U.S. 
GAAP, we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates 
in preparing our financial statements, including in determining 
credit loss reserves, reserves for mortgage repurchases, reserves 
related to litigation and the fair value of certain assets and 
liabilities, among other items. Several of our accounting policies 
are critical because they require management to make difficult, 
subjective and complex judgments about matters that are 
inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially 
different amounts would be reported under different conditions 
or using different assumptions. For a description of these 
policies, refer to the “Critical Accounting Policies” section in this 
Report. If assumptions or estimates underlying our financial 
statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses. 
Certain of our financial instruments, including derivative 
assets and liabilities, debt securities, certain loans, MSRs, private 
equity investments, structured notes and certain repurchase and 
resale agreements, among other items, require a determination 
of their fair value in order to prepare our financial statements. 
Where quoted market prices are not available, we may make fair 
value determinations based on internally developed models or 
other means which ultimately rely to some degree on 
management judgment, and there is no assurance that our 
models will capture or appropriately reflect all relevant inputs 
required to accurately determine fair value. Some of these and 
other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price 
levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, being based 
on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden 
illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and 
securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance 
sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such 
valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and 
could lead to declines in our earnings. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires 
our management to evaluate the Company’s disclosure controls 
and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting 

and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control 
over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual 
report on Form 10-K, the existence of any “material weaknesses” 
in our internal controls. We cannot assure that we will not 
identify one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any 
given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our stock 
price of disclosure of a material weakness. In addition, our 
customers may rely on the effectiveness of our internal controls 
as a service provider, and any deficiency in those controls could 
affect our customers and damage our reputation or business.  
Sarbanes-Oxley also limits the types of non-audit services our 
outside auditors may provide to us in order to preserve their 
independence from us. If our auditors were found not to be 
“independent” of us under SEC rules, we could be required to 
engage new auditors and re-file financial statements and audit 
reports with the SEC. We could be out of compliance with SEC 
rules until new financial statements and audit reports were filed, 
limiting our ability to raise capital and resulting in other adverse 
consequences. 

RISKS RELATED TO STRATEGIC DECISIONS 

If we are unable to develop and execute effective business 
plans or strategies or manage change effectively, our 
competitive standing and results of operations could suffer. 
We are subject to rapid changes in technology, regulation, and 
product innovation, face intense competition for customers, 
sources of revenue, capital, services, qualified team members, 
and other essential business resources, and are subject to 
heightened regulatory expectations particularly with respect to 
compliance and risk management. In order to meet these 
challenges, we may undertake business plans or strategies 
related to, among other things, our organizational structure, our 
compliance and risk management framework, our expenses and 
efficiency, the types of products and services we offer, the types 
of businesses we engage in, the geographies in which we operate, 
the manner in which we serve our clients and customers, the 
third parties with which we do business, and the methods and 
distribution channels by which we offer our products and 
services. Accomplishing these business plans or strategies may 
be complex, time intensive, require significant financial, 
technological, management and other resources, and may divert 
management attention and resources away from other areas of 
the Company, and there is no guarantee that any business plans 
or strategies will ultimately be successful. To the extent we are 
unable to develop or execute effective business plans or 
strategies or manage change effectively, our competitive 
position, reputation, prospects for growth, and results of 
operations may be adversely affected. 

In addition, we regularly explore opportunities to expand our 

products, services, and assets through strategic acquisitions of 
companies or businesses in the financial services industry. We 
generally must receive federal regulatory approvals before we 
can acquire a bank, bank holding company, or certain other 
financial services businesses. We cannot be certain when or if, or 
on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals 
will be granted. We might be required to sell banks, branches 
and/or business units or assets or issue additional equity as a 
condition to receiving regulatory approval for an acquisition. 
When we do announce an acquisition, our stock price may fall 
depending on the size of the acquisition, the type of business to 
be acquired, the purchase price, and the potential dilution to 
existing stockholders or our earnings per share if we issue 
common stock in connection with the acquisition. Furthermore, 
difficulty in integrating an acquired company or business may

117 

 
  
Risk Factors (continued) 

cause us not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, 
increases in geographic or product presence, and other projected 
benefits from the acquisition. The integration could result in 
higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key team 
members, an increase in our compliance costs or risk profile, 
disruption of our business or the acquired business, or otherwise 
harm our ability to retain customers and team members or 
achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Time and 
resources spent on integration may also impair our ability to 
grow our existing businesses. Many of the foregoing risks may be 
increased if the acquired company or business operates 
internationally or in a geographic location where we do not 
already have significant business operations and/or team 
members. Similarly, from time to time, we may decide to divest 
certain businesses or assets. Difficulties in executing a 
divestiture may cause us not to realize any expected cost savings 
or other benefits from the divestiture, or may result in higher 
than expected losses of team members or harm our ability to 
retain customers.

Any factor described in this Report or in any of our other SEC 

filings could by itself, or together with other factors, adversely 
affect our financial results and condition. Refer to our quarterly 
reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC in 2020 for material 
changes to the above discussion of risk factors. There are factors 
not discussed above or elsewhere in this Report that could 
adversely affect our financial results and condition.
