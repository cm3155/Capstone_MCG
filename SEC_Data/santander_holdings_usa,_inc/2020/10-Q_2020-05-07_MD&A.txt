 ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ("MD&#38;A") 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY &#32; 

SHUSA is the parent holding company of SBNA, a national banking association, and owns approximately 76.5% &#32;(as of March 31, 2020 ) of SC, a specialized consumer finance company. SHUSA is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and the Bank's main office is in Wilmington, Delaware. SC is headquartered in Dallas, Texas. SHUSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Santander. SHUSA is also the parent company of Santander BanCorp, a holding company headquartered in Puerto Rico that offers a full range of financial services through its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, BSPR; SSLLC, a registered broker-dealer headquartered in Boston; BSI, a financial services company headquartered in Miami that offers a full range of banking services to foreign individuals and corporations based primarily in Latin America; SIS, a registered broker-dealer headquartered in New York providing services in investment banking, institutional sales, trading and offering research reports of Latin American and European equity and fixed-income securities; and several other subsidiaries. SSLLC, SIS and another SHUSA subsidiary, SAM, are registered investment advisers with the SEC. 

The Bank's principal markets are in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States. The Bank uses its deposits, as well as other financing sources, to fund its loan and investment portfolios. The Bank earns interest income on its loan and investment portfolios. In addition, the Bank generates non-interest income from a number of sources, including deposit and loan services, sales of loans and investment securities, capital markets products and BOLI. The principal non-interest expenses include employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and facility-related costs, technology and other administrative expenses. The financial results of the Bank are affected by the economic environment, including interest rates and consumer and business confidence and spending, as well as the competitive conditions within the Bank's geographic footprint. 

SC is a specialized consumer finance company focused on vehicle finance and third-party servicing. SC's primary business is the indirect origination and securitization of RICs, principally through manufacturer-franchised dealers in connection with their sale of new and used vehicles to subprime retail consumers. Further information about SC&#8217;s business is provided below in the &#8220;Chrysler Capital&#8221; section. 

SC is managed through a single reporting segment which included vehicle financial products and services, including RICs, vehicle leases, and dealer loans, as well as financial products and services related to recreational and marine vehicles and other consumer finance products. 

SC also originates vehicle loans through a web-based direct lending program, purchases vehicle RICs from other lenders, and services automobile and recreational and marine vehicle portfolios for other lenders. Additionally, SC has other relationships through which it holds other consumer finance products. However, in 2015, SC announced its exit from personal lending and, accordingly, all of its personal lending assets are classified as HFS at December 31, 2019. 

Since its IPO, SC has been consolidated with the Company and Santander for financial reporting and accounting purposes. If the Company directly, owned 80% or more of SC Common Stock, SC could be consolidated with the Company for tax filing and capital planning purposes. Among other things, tax consolidation would (1) facilitate certain offsets of SC&#8217;s taxable income, (2) eliminate the double taxation of dividends from SC, and (3) trigger a release into SHUSA&#8217;s income of an approximately $336 million &#32;deferred tax liability recognized with respect to the GAAP basis vs. the income tax basis in the Company's ownership of SC. Tax consolidation would also allow for SC's net deferred tax liability to off-set the Company's net deferred tax asset, which would provide a regulatory capital benefit. In addition, SHUSA and Santander would recognize a larger percentage of SC's net income. SC Common Stock is listed for trading on the NYSE under the trading symbol "SC" 

Chrysler Capital 

Since May 2013, under the Chrysler Agreement, SC has operated as FCA&#8217;s preferred provider for consumer loans, leases and dealer loans and provides services to FCA customers and dealers under the Chrysler Capital brand. These products and services include consumer RICs and leases, as well as dealer loans for inventory, construction, real estate, working capital and revolving lines of credit. 

Chrysler Capital continues to be a focal point of SC's strategy. On June 28, 2019, SC entered into an amendment to the Chrysler Agreement with FCA which modified the Chrysler Agreement to, among other things, adjust certain performance metrics, exclusivity commitments and payment provisions under the Chrysler Agreement. The amendment also established an operating framework that is mutually beneficial for both parties for the remainder of the contract. The Company's average penetration rate under the Chrysler Agreement for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 &#32;was 39% , an increase from 31% &#32;for the same period in 2019 . 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

SC has dedicated financing facilities in place for its Chrysler Capital business and has worked strategically and collaboratively with FCA to continue to strengthen its relationship and create value within the Chrysler Capital program. During the three-month period ended &#160; March 31, 2020 , SC originated $2.6 billion &#32;in Chrysler Capital loans, which represented 53% of the UPB of its total RIC originations, as well as $2.0 billion in Chrysler Capital leases. Additionally, substantially all of the leases originated by SC during three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 &#32;were under the Chrysler Agreement. 

ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 

Overview 

During the first &#32;quarter of 2020 , unemployment increased and year-to-date market results were negative, reflecting the effects of COVID-19. 

The unemployment rate at March 31, 2020 &#32;was 4.4% &#32;compared to 3.5% &#32;at December 31, 2019 , and 3.8% &#32;one year ago. Unemployment levels are expected to increase significantly in the second quarter of 2020 and beyond as a result of the effects of COVID-19. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment decreased in the leisure and hospitality sector mainly in food services and drink places. In addition, notable declines were seen in healthcare and social assistance, professional and business services, retail trade, and construction. 

Market year-to-date returns for the following indices based on closing prices at March 31, 2020 &#32;were:

In light of the effects COVID-19 will have on economic activity, at its March 2020 &#32;meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to lower the federal funds rate target range to 0.00% &#32;to 0.25% . The Committee expects to maintain this target rate until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability. This action will help support economic activity, strong labor market conditions and inflation to remain at the targeted rate of 2.0% . 

The ten-year Treasury bond rate at March 31, 2020 &#32;was 0.70% , down from 1.90% &#32;at December 31, 2019 . Within the industry, changes in this metric are often considered to correspond to changes in 15-year and 30-year mortgage rates. 

Changing market conditions are considered a significant risk factor to the Company. The interest rate environment can present challenges in the growth of net interest income for the banking industry, which continues to rely on non-interest activities to support revenue growth. Changing market conditions and political uncertainty could have an overall impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Such conditions could also impact the Company's credit risk and the associated credit loss expense and legal expense .

SHUSA funds its operations independently of the other entities owned by Santander, and believes its business is not necessarily closely related to the business or outlook of other entities owned by Santander. Future changes in the credit ratings of its parent, Santander, or the Kingdom of Spain, however, could impact SHUSA's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings, and any other change in the condition of Santander could affect SHUSA. 

At this time, SC is not rated by the major credit rating agencies. 

Impacts of COVID- 19 on our current and future financial and operating status and planning 

The current outbreak of COVID-19 has materially impacted our business, and the continuance of this pandemic or any future outbreak of any other highly contagious diseases or other public health emergency, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 

Due to the unpredictable and rapidly changing nature of this outbreak and the resulting economic distress, it is not possible to determine with certainty the ultimate impact on our results of operations or whether other currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of operations; however, certain adverse effects have already manifested themselves or are probable. The following summarizes our current expectations of the impacts of COVID-19 on the Company's current financial and operating status, as well as on its future operational and financial planning as of the date hereof: 

&#8226; 

Impact on workforce: The health and well-being of our colleagues and customers is a top priority for the Company. The Company has implemented business continuity plans and has followed guidelines issued by government authorities regarding social distancing and work-from-home arrangements. Currently, approximately 90-95% of the workforce continues to work from home. In addition, the Company has established a Temporary Emergency Paid Leave Program that provides employees with up to 80 hours of additional paid time off to use &#8211; either continuously or intermittently, and before exhausting other paid time off &#8211; to assist with needs related to COVID-19. Further, the Company is providing $250 a week in pay premiums for frontline customer support workers to help defray additional costs incurred while coming to work during the pandemic. 

While our business continuity plans are in place, if significant portions of our workforce, our subsidiaries' workforces, or our vendors' workforces are unable to work effectively as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, including because of illness, stay-at-home orders, facility closures, reductions in services or hours of operation, or ineffective remote work arrangements, there may be servicing disruptions, which could result in reduced collection effectiveness or impair our or our subsidiaries' ability to operate our businesses and satisfy obligations under third-party servicing agreements. Each of these scenarios could have negative effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

&#8226; 

Impact on services: The COVID-19 outbreak as well as state stay-at-home orders have resulted in the closure of certain branches in highly affected areas within the Bank's footprint. To comply with social distancing guidelines and help minimize the spread of the coronavirus, the Bank has instituted temporary changes to how it operates, including closure of certain branches and limitations on services provided to others. Certain limited service locations may only perform teller transactions- such as depositing and cashing checks and handling requests for cash withdrawals, money orders and cashier's checks - in the lobby or at the drive-thru. In addition, some branches only provide account opening and servicing with a banker by appointment only. Full and limited-service branches are limiting the number of people allowed in our locations at one time. Branch hours have been changed temporarily, with certain branches providing special hours for high-risk customers. Retail customers are encouraged to take advantage of mobile and online banking enabling customers to bank anytime, anywhere, for services including: checking account balances, remote check deposit, transfers, bill pay, and more. Retail customers can also utilize automated services via phone to make balance and transaction inquiries, payments on loans, transfers between accounts, stop payments, and more. Our call center remains staffed and open seven days a week to better serve our customers. Business customers can continue to utilize the business mobile banking application and business online banking to minimize the need to go to branches or exchange cash. We have developed the "Business First Coronavirus Resource Page" for our business customers during this time. 

&#8226; 

Impact on customers and loan and lease performance: The COVID-19 outbreak and associated economic crisis have led to negative effects on our customers. Unlike the regional impact of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, the COVID-19 outbreak is impacting customers nationwide and is expected to have a materially more significant impact on the performance of our loan and lease portfolios than even the most severe historical natural disaster. 

Closures and disruptions to businesses in the United States have led to negative effects on our customers. Similar to many other financial institutions, we have taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate our customers&#8217; COVID-19-related economic challenges. The Company is actively working with its borrowers who have been impacted by COVID-19. This unique and evolving situation has created temporary personal and financial challenges for our retail and commercial borrowers. The Company is working prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of COVID-19 and has developed loan modification and deferral programs to mitigate the adverse effects of COVID-19 to our loan customers. We have experienced a sharp increase in requests for extensions and modifications related to COVID-19 nationwide and a significant number of such extensions and modifications have been granted. In addition, we have temporarily suspended&#8212;and may continue to temporarily suspend&#8212; involuntary automobile repossessions and foreclosures on mortgage and home equity lines although we may elect to re-initiate involuntary repossessions and foreclosures at any time. 

These customer support programs, by their nature, are expected to negatively impact our financial performance and other results of operations in the near term. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected in the longer term if the COVID-19 outbreak leads us to continue to provide such programs for a significant period of time, if the number of customers experiencing hardship related directly or indirectly to the outbreak of COVID-19 increases, or if our customer support programs are not effective in mitigating the effects of COVID-19 on our customers' financial situations. Given the unpredictable nature of this situation, the nature and extent of such effects cannot be predicted at this time. 

In addition to the measures discussed above, the Bank is providing assistance for its retail customers, including helping those experiencing difficulties with loan payments, waiving fees for early CD withdrawals, refunding late payment and overdraft fees, offering credit card limit increases, and increasing cash availability limits at ATMs. For business banking customers, the Bank is working with customers in offering interest-only loan accommodations, deferrals and extensions up to 90 days for customers experiencing hardships, and minimum monthly processing fees for merchant service customers. In addition, the Bank has originated loans in the first and second rounds of the Paycheck Protection Program, a key part of the CARES Act that authorizes loans to small businesses to help meet payroll costs during the COVID-19 outbreak. The program is administered by the Small Business Administration, and the loans and accrued interest are forgivable after eight weeks as long as the borrower uses the loan for eligible purposes, such as payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains employee and payroll levels. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

&#8226; 

Impact on originations, including the relationship with FCA: In many jurisdictions, businesses such as automobile dealers have been required to temporarily close or restrict their operations. Further, even for dealerships that have remained open, consumer demand has deteriorated rapidly. As a result, SC has partnered with FCA to launch new incentive programs including the first payment deferred for 90 days on select FCA models and a 0% annual percentage yield for 84 months on select 2019/2020 FCA models. However, if the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic is sustained, it could result in further declines in new and used vehicle sales and downward pressure on used vehicle values, which could materially adversely affect our origination of auto loans and leases and the performance of our existing loans and leases. 

&#8226; 

While banking is considered an essential business in all of the Bank&#8217;s footprint states, executive orders have limited the scope of work of vendors supporting mortgage and home equity lines of credit such as appraisers, notaries, law firms, title companies and settlement agents or stopped these vendors from working altogether. As a result of these restrictions, the number of mortgages, home equity lines of credit and refinancings have declined, and the Bank has had to stop loan and line originations in certain states. Because it is unclear how long these executive orders and laws related to COVID-19 will remain in place, it is difficult to estimate the overall negative impact these orders will continue to have on mortgage and home equity line of credit originations and refinancings. 

&#8226; 

Impact on operations: Government and regulatory authorities could also implement laws, regulations, executive orders and other guidance that allow customers to forgo making scheduled payments for some period of time, require modifications to receivables (e.g., waiving accrued interest), preclude creditors from exercising certain rights or taking certain actions with respect to collateral, including repossession or liquidation of collateral, or mandate limited operations or temporary closures of the Company or our vendors as &#8220;non-essential businesses&#8221; or otherwise. While we have business continuity plans in place, if significant portions of our or our vendors&#8217; workforces are unable to work effectively as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including because of illness, stay-at-home orders, facility closures reductions in services or hours of operation, or ineffective remote work arrangements, there may be servicing disruptions, which could result in reduced collection effectiveness or our ability to operate our business and satisfy our obligations under our third-party servicing agreements. Each of these scenarios could have negative effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#8226; 

Impact on debt and liquidity: As international trade and business activity has slowed and supply chains have been disrupted, global credit and financial markets have recently experienced, and may continue to experience significant disruption and volatility. During the first quarter of 2020, financial markets experienced significant declines and volatility, and such market conditions may continue and/or precede recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy. Under these circumstances, we may experience some or all of the risks related to market volatility and recessionary conditions described under the caption "We are vulnerable to disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets" in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K. 

Governmental and regulatory authorities have recently implemented fiscal and monetary policies and initiatives to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on the economy and individual businesses and households. However, these governmental and regulatory actions may not be successful in mitigating the adverse economic effects of COVID-19 and could affect our net interest income and reduce our profitability. Sustained adverse economic effects from the pandemic may also result in downgrades in our credit ratings or adversely affect the interest rate environment. If our access to funding is reduced or if our costs to obtain such funding significantly increases, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

The Company's liquidity comes from several primary sources outlined in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this MD&#38;A, including deposits, as well as public and financing activities. During this period, unsecured debt and securitization markets experienced significant widening of credit spread and periods of market disruption. On March 31, SHUSA issued a $500 million, 3-year fixed debt instrument to BSSA. The Bank continued to maintain stable deposits and consistent access to the various sources of wholesale funding including FHLB advances and brokered CDs. In the month of March, Bank took FHLB advances of $2.5 billion and issued more than $500 million in brokered CDs. In addition to significant amounts of liquidity available from warehouse lines and affiliate lines of credit, SC had continued access to liquidity during ABS market dislocation and executed three private financing transactions for approximately $2.4 billion in the final two weeks of March 2020 and an SDART transaction of approximately $1.0 billion in April 2020. However, due to the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is not possible to predict whether unanticipated consequences of the pandemic will materially affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

&#8226; 

Impact on dividends: Historically the Company made dividend payments to Santander, and received dividends from the Bank and other IHC entities. The amount and size of any future dividends, however, will be subject to various factors, including the Company's capital and liquidity positions, regulatory considerations, impacts related to the COVID-19 outbreak, any accounting standards that affect capital or liquidity (including CECL), financial and operational performance, alternative uses of capital, and general market conditions, and may be changed or suspended at any time. 

&#8226; 

Impact on impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived and long-lived assets: The Company has analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on its financial statements, including the potential for impairment. The analysis did not indicate any impairment for the Company's loan and lease portfolios, goodwill, leased vehicles, ROU assets, or other non-financial assets such as upfront fees or other intangibles. 

&#8226; 

Impact on communities: The Company is committed to supporting our communities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Company's non-profit foundation has begun responding to the COVID-19 crisis with $200 thousand in donations to a select group of organizations addressing community issues. 

In addition, SHUSA's ongoing support for non-profit partners providing essential services in our communities includes $15.0 million in charitable giving this year. Further SHUSA will provide $25.0 million in financing to community development financial institutions to fund small business loans and will expedite grant funding and payments where possible to help sustain nonprofit operations during this time. 

Overall, due to the evolving nature of the pandemic, we are currently unable to estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Our initiatives may negatively impact our revenue and other results of operations in the near term and, if not effective in mitigating the effect of COVID-19 on our customers, may adversely affect our business and results of operations more materially over a longer period of time. 

REGULATORY MATTERS &#32; 

The activities of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Bank and SC, are subject to regulation under various U.S. federal laws and regulatory agencies which impose regulations, supervise and conduct examinations, and may affect the operations and management of the Company and its ability to take certain actions, including making distributions to our parent, Santander. The Company is regulated on a consolidated basis by the Federal Reserve, including the FRB of Boston, and the CFPB. The Company's banking and bank holding company subsidiaries are further supervised by the FDIC and the OCC. As a subsidiary of the Company, SC is also subject to regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve as well as the CFPB. Santander BanCorp and BSPR also are supervised by the Puerto Rico Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions. 

Payment of Dividends 

SHUSA is the parent holding company of SBNA and other consolidated subsidiaries, and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. SHUSA and SBNA are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including regulatory capital minimums and the requirement to remain "well-capitalized" under prompt corrective action regulations. As a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, SC is included in various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends as described in the &#8220;Stress Tests and Capital Adequacy&#8221; discussion in this section. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&#38;A for detail of the capital actions of the Company and its subsidiaries during the period. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

FBOs 

In February 2014, the Federal Reserve issued the final rule implementing certain EPS mandated by the DFA. Under the Final Rule, FBOs with over $50 billion of U.S. non-branch assets, including Santander, were required to consolidate U.S. subsidiary activities under an IHC. In addition, the Final Rule required U.S. BHCs and FBOs with at least $50 billion in total U.S. consolidated non-branch assets to be subject to EPS and heightened capital, liquidity, risk management, and stress testing requirements. Due to both its global and U.S. non-branch total consolidated asset size, Santander was subject to both of the above provisions of the Final Rule. As a result of this rule, Santander has transferred substantially all of its U.S. bank and non-bank subsidiaries previously outside the Company to the Company, which became an IHC effective July 1, 2016 . 

Economic Growth Act 

In May 2018, the Economic Growth Act was signed into law. The Economic Growth Act scales back certain requirements of the DFA. In October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized a rulemaking implementing the changes required by the Economic Growth Act. The rulemaking provides a tailored approach to the EPS mandated by Section 165 of the DFA. Under the new tailored approach, banks are placed into different categories based on asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. The tailoring rule applies to both Santander and the Company. Both Santander and the Company were placed into category four of the tailoring rule. The new tailored standards are discussed further below. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules are applicable to both SHUSA and the Bank and establish a comprehensive capital framework that includes both the advanced approaches for the largest internationally active U.S. banks, formerly known as Basel II, and a standardized approach that applies to all banking organizations with over $500 million in assets. 

These rules narrow the definition of regulatory capital and establish higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and prompt corrective action thresholds that, when fully phased in, require banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank, to maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total capital ratio of 8.0% and a minimum leverage ratio, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets for the quarter, of 4.0%. A further capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above these minimum ratios was phased in effective January 1, 2019. This buffer is required for banking institutions and BHCs to avoid restrictions on their ability to make capital distributions, including paying dividends. 

These U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules include deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that MSRs, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities are deducted from CET1 to the extent any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 for the Company and the Bank began on January 1, 2015 and was initially planned over three years, with a fully phased-in requirement of January 1, 2018. However, during 2017, the regulatory agencies finalized changes to the capital rules that became effective on January 1, 2018. These changes extended the current treatment and deferred the final transition provision phase-in at non-advanced approach institutions for certain capital elements, and suspended the risk weight to 100 percent for certain deferred taxes and mortgage servicing assets not disallowed from capital, in lieu of advancing to 250 percent. During 2019, the regulatory agencies approved a final rule which includes simplifications for non-advanced approaches to the generally applicable capital rules, specifically with regard to the treatment of minority interest, as well as modifying the risk-weight to 250 percent for certain deferred taxes and mortgage servicing assets not disallowed from capital. This final rule became effective on April 1, 2020. 

As described in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, on January 1, 2020, we adopted the CECL Standard, which upon adoption resulted in a reduction to our opening retained earnings balance, net of income tax, and an increase to the allowance for loan losses of approximately $2.5 billion. As also described in our Form 10-K, the U.S. banking agencies in December 2018 approved a final rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing banking organizations, including the Company, the option to phase in the day-one impact of CECL until the first quarter of 2023. In March 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The Company is electing this alternative option instead of the one described in the December 2018 rule. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

See the Bank Regulatory Capital section of this MD&#38;A for the Company's capital ratios under Basel III standards. The implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the Company's regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors, including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the Company. 

If capital has reached the significantly or critically undercapitalized levels, further material restrictions can be imposed, including restrictions on interest payable on accounts, dismissal of management and, in critically undercapitalized situations, appointment of a receiver or conservator. Critically undercapitalized institutions generally may not, beginning 60 days after becoming critically undercapitalized, make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt. All but well-capitalized institutions are prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvements Act and OCC regulations, institutions which are not categorized as well-capitalized or adequately-capitalized are restricted from making capital distributions, which include cash dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers, interest payments on certain convertible debt and other transactions charged to the capital account of the institution. At March 31, 2020 , the Bank met the criteria to be classified as &#8220; well-capitalized .&#8221; 

On April 10, 2018, the Federal Reserve issued an NPR seeking comment on a proposal to simplify capital rules for large banks. If finalized as proposed, the NPR would replace the capital conservation buffer. The capital conservation buffer would be replaced with a new SCB. The SCB is calculated as the maximum decline in CET1 in the severely adverse scenario (subject to a 2.5% floor) plus four quarters of dividends. The proposal would result in new regulatory capital minimums which are equal to 4.5% CET1 plus the SCB, any GSIB surcharge, and any countercyclical capital buffer. The GSIB buffer is applicable only to the largest and most complex firms and does not apply to SHUSA. These new minimums would be firm-specific and would trigger restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses in the event a firm falls below their new minimums. Firms would still submit a capital plan annually. Supervisory expectations for capital planning processes would not change under the proposal. The Company does not expect this NPR, if finalized as proposed, to have a material impact on its current or future planned capital actions. This rule was finalized on March 4, 2020, and its impact is being evaluated. 

Stress Testing and Capital Planning 

The DFA also requires certain banks and BHCs, including the Company, to perform a stress test and submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve and receive a notice of non-objection before taking capital actions, such as paying dividends, implementing common equity repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. In June 2018, the Company announced that the Federal Reserve did not object to the planned capital actions described in the Company&#8217;s capital plan through June 30, 2019. In February 2019, the Federal Reserve announced that SHUSA, as well as other less complex firms, would receive a one-year extension of the requirement to submit its capital plan until April 5, 2020. The Federal Reserve also announced that, for the period beginning July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, the Company would be allowed to make capital distributions up to the amount that would have allowed it to remain above all minimum capital requirements in CCAR 2018, adjusted for any changes in the Company&#8217;s regulatory capital ratios since the Federal Reserve acted on the 2018 capital plan. 

In October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized rules that tailor the stress testing and capital actions a company is required to perform based on the company&#8217;s asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. Under the tailoring rules, the Company is required to submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis. The Company is also subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle. The Company continues to evaluate planned capital actions in its annual capital plan and on an ongoing basis. 

Liquidity Rules 

The Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC have established a rule to implement the Basel III LCR for certain internationally active banks and nonbank financial companies, and a modified version of the LCR for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active. The LCR is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to its expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon. Smaller covered companies (more than $50 billion in assets) such as the Company were required to calculate the LCR monthly beginning January 2016. 

In October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized rules that tailor the liquidity requirements based on a company&#8217;s asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. In light of the fact that the Company is under $250 billion in assets and has less than $50 billion in short-term wholesale funding, the Company is no longer required to disclose the US LCR. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The NSFR is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon The NSFR requires banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to their on- and off-balance sheet activities, thereby reducing the likelihood that disruptions to a bank's regular sources of funding will erode its liquidity in a way that could increase the risk of its failure and potentially lead to broader systemic stress. In May 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule for NSFR applicable to U.S. financial institutions. The proposed rule has not been finalized, and the Company is currently evaluating the impact the proposed rule would have on its financial position, results of operations and disclosures. 

Resolution Planning 

The DFA requires all BHCs and FBOs with assets of $50 billion or more to prepare and regularly update resolution plans. The 165(d) Resolution Plan must assume that the covered company is resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and that no &#8220;extraordinary support&#8221; is received from the U.S. or any other government. The most recent 165(d) Resolution Plan was submitted to the Federal Reserve and FDIC in December 2018. In addition, under amended Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvements Act rules, the IDI resolution plan rule requires that a bank with assets of $50 billion or more develop a plan for its resolution that supports depositors&#8217; rapid access to their insured deposits, maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets, and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by creditors in resolution. The most recent IDI resolution plan was submitted to the FDIC in June 2018. SHUSA and SBNA are currently awaiting feedback. 

TLAC 

The TLAC Rule requires certain U.S. organizations to maintain a minimum amount of loss-absorbing instruments, including a minimum amount of unsecured LTD. The TLAC Rule applies to U.S. GSIBs and to IHCs with $50 billion or more in U.S. non-branch assets that are controlled by a global systemically important FBO. The Company is such an IHC. 

Under the TLAC Rule, companies are required to maintain a minimum amount of TLAC, which consists of a minimum amount of LTD and Tier 1 capital. As a result, SHUSA must hold the higher of 18% of its RWAs or 9% of its total consolidated assets in the form of TLAC, of which 6% of its RWAs or 3.5% of total consolidated assets must consist of LTD. In addition, SHUSA must maintain a TLAC buffer composed solely of CET1 capital and will be subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments based on the size of the TLAC buffer it maintains. The TLAC Rule became effective on January 1, 2019. 

Volcker Rule 

The DFA added new Section 13 to the BHCA, which is commonly referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule.&#8221; The Volcker Rule prohibits a &#8220;banking entity&#8221; from engaging in &#8220;proprietary trading&#8221; or engaging in any of the following activities with respect to a Covered Fund: (i) acquiring or retaining any equity, partnership or other ownership interest in the Covered Fund; (ii) controlling the Covered Fund; or (iii) engaging in certain transactions with the fund if the banking entity or any affiliate is an investment adviser or sponsor to the Covered Fund. These prohibitions are subject to certain exemptions for permitted activities. 

Because the term &#8220;banking entity&#8221; includes an IDI, a depository institution holding company and any of their affiliates, the Volcker Rule has sweeping worldwide application and covers entities such as Santander, the Company, and certain of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries (including the Bank and SC), as well as other Santander subsidiaries in the United States and abroad. 

The Company implemented certain policies and procedures, training programs, recordkeeping, internal controls and other compliance requirements that were necessary to comply with the Volcker Rule. As required by the Volcker Rule, the compliance infrastructure has been tailored to each banking entity based on its size and its level of trading and Covered Fund activities. SHUSA's compliance program includes, among other things, processes for prior approval of new activities and investments permitted under the Volcker Rule, testing and auditing for compliance and a process for attesting annually that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule. 

In October 2019, the joint agencies responsible for administering the Volcker Rule finalized revisions to Volcker Rule. The final rule tailors the Volcker Rule&#8217;s compliance requirements to the amount of a firm&#8217;s trading activity, revise the definition of a trading account, clarify certain key provisions in the Volcker Rule, and simplify the information companies are required to provide the banking agencies. The Company is in the process of transitioning to the requirements of this revised rule. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Risk Retention Rule 

In December 2014, the Federal Reserve issued its final credit risk retention rule, which generally requires sponsors of ABS to retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing ABS. SHUSA, primarily through SC, is an active participant in the structured finance markets and began to comply with the retention requirements effective in December 2016. 

Market Risk Rule 

The market risk rule requires certain national banks to measure and hold risk-based regulatory capital for the market risk of their covered positions. The bank must measure and hold capital for its market risk using its internal-risk based models. The market risk rule outlines quantitative requirements for the bank's internal risk based models, as well as qualitative requirements for the bank's management of market risk. Banks subject to the market risk rule must also measure and hold market risk regulatory capital for the specific risk associated with certain debt and equity positions. 

A bank is subject to the market risk capital rules if its consolidated trading activity, defined as the sum of trading assets and liabilities as reported in its FFIEC 031 and FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, equals the lesser of: (1) 10 percent or more of the bank's total assets as reported in its Call Report and FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, or (2) $1 billion or more. At September 30, 2019, SBNA reported aggregate trading exposure in excess of the market risk threshold, and as a result, both the Company and SBNA began holding the market risk component within RWAs of the risk-based capital ratios, and submitted the FFIEC 102 - Market Risk Regulatory Report beginning for the period ended December 31, 2019. The incorporation of market risk within regulatory capital has resulted in a decrease in the risk-based capital ratios. 

Capital Simplification Rule 

The federal banking agencies are adopting a final rule that simplifies for non-advanced approaches banking organizations the generally applicable capital rules and makes a number of technical corrections. Specifically, it reverses the previous transition provision freeze on MSRs and deferred tax assets by modifying the risk-weight from 100% to 250%. The rule will also replace the existing methodology for calculating includible minority interest with a flat 10% limit at each capital level. The increased risk weighting presents an unfavorable decline to the Company's risk-based ratios, but it is estimated that the Tier 1 and total capital ratios will improve overall due to the additional minority interest includible under the simplified rule. The capital simplification rule becomes effective April 1, 2020; however, regulators granted the option for institutions to adopt early on January 1, 2020. The Company chose to adopt this new rule on April 1, 2020. 

Heightened Standards 

OCC guidelines to strengthen the governance and risk management practices of large financial institutions are commonly referred to as &#8220;heightened standards.&#8221; The heightened standards apply to insured national banks with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets. The heightened standards require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activities. The heightened standards also provide minimum standards for the institutions&#8217; boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

Depository institutions must remain in compliance with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve's Regulation W, which governs transactions of the Company's banking subsidiaries with affiliated companies and individuals. Section 23A imposes limits on certain specified &#8220;covered transactions,&#8221; which include loans, lines, and letters of credit to affiliated companies or individuals, and investments in affiliated companies, as well as certain other transactions with affiliated companies and individuals. The aggregate of all covered transactions is limited to 10% of a bank&#8217;s capital and surplus for any one affiliate and 20% for all affiliates. Certain covered transactions also must meet collateral requirements that range from 100% to 130% depending on the type of transaction. 

Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act prohibits a depository institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are considered arms'-length. To meet the definition of arm's-length, the terms of the transaction must be the same, or at least as favorable, as those for similar transactions with non-affiliated companies. As a U.S. domiciled subsidiary of a global parent with significant non-bank affiliates, the Company faces elevated compliance risk in this area. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Regulation AB II 

Regulation AB II, among other things, expanded disclosure requirements and modified the offering and shelf registration process for ABS. SC must comply with these rules, which impact all offerings of publicly registered ABS and all reports under the Exchange Act, for outstanding publicly-registered ABS, and affect SC's public securitization platform. 

CRA 

SBNA and BSPR are subject to the requirements of the CRA, which requires the appropriate federal financial supervisory agency to assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which it is located. BSPR&#8217;s current CRA rating is &#8220;Outstanding&#8221; and SBNA&#8217;s current CRA rating is "Satisfactory." The OCC takes into account the Bank&#8217;s CRA rating in considering certain regulatory applications the Bank makes, including applications related to establishing and relocating branches, and the Federal Reserve does the same with respect to certain regulatory applications the Company makes. 

On December 12, 2019, the OCC and the FDIC jointly issued the CRA NPR to modernize the regulatory framework implementing the CRA. The CRA NPR generally focuses on clarifying and expanding the activities that qualify for CRA consideration, providing benchmarks to determine what levels of activity are necessary to obtain a particular CRA rating, establishing additional assessment areas based on the location of a bank&#8217;s deposits, and increasing clarity and consistency in reporting. The CRA NPR contemplates that regulators will provide a publicly available, non-exhaustive list of activities that would automatically receive CRA consideration. In addition, the CRA NPR allows banks to receive consideration for certain qualifying activities conducted outside their assessment areas. It currently is unclear when and in what manner the OCC and FDIC will finalize the CRA NPR. 

Other Regulatory Matters 

On February 25, 2015, SC entered into a consent order with the DOJ, approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, which resolved the DOJ&#8217;s claims against SC that certain of its repossession and collection activities during the period of time between January 2008 and February 2013 violated the SCRA. The consent order required SC to pay a civil fine in the amount of $55,000, as well as at least $9.4 million to affected service members, consisting of $10,000 per service member plus compensation for any lost equity (with interest) for each repossession by SC and $5,000 per service member for each instance where SC sought to collect repossession-related fees on accounts for which a repossession was conducted by a prior account-holder. The consent order required SC to undertake additional remedial measures. The consent order also subjected SC to monitoring by the DOJ for compliance with the SCRA for a period of five years. The consent order terminated as of February 27, 2020. 

On March 21, 2017, SC and the Company entered into a written agreement with the FRB of Boston. Under the terms of that agreement, SC is required to enhance its compliance risk management program, board oversight of risk management and senior management oversight of risk management, and the Company is required to enhance its oversight of SC's management and operations. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Disclosure Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act 

Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act, an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. 

The following activities are disclosed in response to Section 13(r) with respect to affiliates of SHUSA within the Santander Group. During the period covered by this annual report: 

&#8226; 

Santander UK holds accounts for two &#32;customers, with the first customer holding one GBP savings account and one GBP current account and the second customer holding one GBP savings account. Both of the customers, who are resident in the UK, are currently designated by the U.S. under the SDGT sanctions program. Revenues and profits generated by Santander UK on these accounts in the first quarter of 2020 &#32;were negligible &#32;relative to the overall profits of Santander UK. 

&#8226; 

Santander UK holds two &#32;frozen current accounts for two UK nationals who are designated by the U.S. under the SDGT sanctions program. The accounts held by each customer have been frozen since their designation and remained frozen through the first quarter of 2020 . These accounts are frozen in order to comply with Articles 2, 3 and 7 of Council Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 imposing certain specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities associated with the Al-Qaeda network, by virtue of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1815. The accounts are in arrears (&#163; 1,844.73 &#32;in debit combined) and are currently being managed by Santander UK's Collections and Recoveries Department. No &#32;revenues or profits were generated by Santander UK on these accounts in the first quarter of 2020 . 

&#8226; 

The Santander Group also has certain legacy performance guarantees for the benefit of Bank Sepah and Bank Mellat (stand-by letters of credit to guarantee the obligations - either under tender documents or under contracting agreements - of contractors who participated in public bids in Iran) that were in place prior to April 27, 2007. 

In the aggregate, all of the transactions described above resulted in gross revenues and net profits in the first quarter of 2020 &#32;which were negligible &#32;relative to the overall revenues and profits of Santander. Santander has undertaken significant steps to withdraw from the Iranian market, such as closing its representative office in Iran and ceasing all banking activities therein, including correspondent relationships, deposit-taking from Iranian entities and issuing export letters of credit, except for the legacy transactions described above. Santander is not contractually permitted to cancel these arrangements without either (i) paying the guaranteed amount (in the case of the performance guarantees), or (ii) forfeiting the outstanding amounts due to it (in the case of the export credits). As such, Santander intends to continue to provide the guarantees and hold these assets in accordance with company policy and applicable laws. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This MD&#38;A is based on the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The significant accounting policies of the Company are described in Note 1 &#32;&#32;of the Company's Annual Form 10-K as of December 31, 2019, and have been updated as appropriate in Note 1 of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, accordingly, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Our estimates include consideration of the current uncertainty in the economy and the results may be materially different. Management identified accounting for ACL, estimates of expected residual values of leased vehicles subject to operating leases, accretion of discounts and subvention on RICs, goodwill, fair value measurements and income taxes as the Company's most critical accounting estimates, in that they are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results and require management&#8217;s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. 

There have been material changes in the Company&#8217;s critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in Item 7 of the Company's 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These changes are a result of the Company's adoption of the CECL Standard on January 1, 2020. Refer to Note 1, Note 4 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the section captioned "Credit Quality" of this MD&#38;A for detailed discussions around accounting policy, estimation process and assumptions used in determining the ACL.

Net interest income decreased $16.9 million &#32;for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 &#32;compared to 2019 . The most significant factors contributing to this decrease are as follows: 

Interest Income on Investment Securities and Interest-Earning Deposits 

Interest income on investment securities and interest-earning deposits decreased $9.5 million &#32;for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 &#32;compared to 2019 . The average balances of investment securities and interest-earning deposits for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 &#32;was $25.9 billion &#32;with an average yield of 2.04% , compared to an average balance of $20.6 billion &#32;with an average yield of 2.75% &#32;for the corresponding period in 2019 . The decrease in interest income on investment securities and interest-earning deposits for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 &#32;was primarily due to a decrease in the average yield on interest-earning deposits resulting from the Federal Reserve response to the outbreak of COVID-19. 

Interest Income on Loans 

Interest income on loans decreased $21.6 million &#32;for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 , compared to 2019 . The average balance of total loans increased $4.4 billion &#32;for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 &#32;compared to 2019 . This increase in average loans was primarily driven by the continued growth of auto loans and RICs; however, the average rate has decreased on the RIC portfolio due to more prime loan originations as a result of SC's origination program for SBNA. 

Interest Expense on Deposits and Related Customer Accounts 

Interest expense on deposits and related customer accounts was generally stable for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 &#32;compared to 2019 . 

Interest Expense on Borrowed Funds 

Interest expense on borrowed funds decreased $12.5 million &#32;for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 &#32;compared to 2019 . This decrease was due to lower interest rates being paid offset by increased balances during the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 . The average balance of total borrowings was $51.0 billion &#32;with an average cost of 3.10% &#32;for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 , compared to an average balance of $44.8 billion &#32;with an average cost of 3.64% &#32;for 2019 . The average balance of borrowed funds increased for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 &#32;compared to the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2019 , primarily due to increases in FHLB advances, credit facilities and secured structured financings. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

CREDIT LOSS EXPENSE 

Credit loss expense was comprised of credit loss expense on loans of $1.1 billion &#32;and credit loss expense on unfunded lending commitments of $67.7 million &#32;for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 , compared to credit loss expense on loans of $603.0 million &#32;and a recovery of credit losses on unfunded lending commitments of $2.8 million &#32;for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2019 . The increase in credit loss expense was primarily due to business drivers during the first quarter of 2020, including $0.7 billion &#32;of additional reserves specific to COVID-19 risk, partially offset by balance changes in the portfolio mix. 

Consumer charge-offs and recoveries were $1.2 billion &#32;and $611.3 million &#32;for the three-month periods ended &#32; March 31, 2020 &#32;compared to $1.4 billion &#32;and $782.9 million , respectively, for the same period in and March 31, 2019 . The decreases were due to due to less auction units and repossessions in the RIC portfolio primarily because of COVID-19. 

Commercial charge-offs and recoveries were $53.5 million &#32;and $10.7 million &#32;for the three-month periods ended &#32; March 31, 2020 &#32;compared to $23.6 million &#32;and $8.5 million , respectively, for the same period in and March 31, 2019 . There were no individually significant commercial customer charge-offs comprising the increase.

Total general, administrative and other expenses increased $41.4 million &#32;for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 &#32;compared to the first quarter of 2019 . The most significant factors contributing to these increases were as follows: 

&#8226; 

Lease expense increased $111.1 million &#32;for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 &#32;compared to 2019 . This increase was primarily due to the continued growth of the Company's leased vehicle portfolio. 

&#8226; 

Other expenses decreased $57.4 million &#32;for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 , compared to the corresponding period in 2019 . This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in legal and operational risk expenses. 

INCOME TAX PROVISION 

An income tax benefit of $33.4 million &#32;was recorded for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 , compared to an income tax provision of $116.2 million &#32;for 2019 . This resulted in an ETR of 21.3% &#32;for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 , compared to 32.7% &#32;for the first quarter of 2019 . 

The Company's ETR in future periods will be affected by the results of operations allocated to the various tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates, any change in income tax laws or regulations within those jurisdictions, and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the Company's interpretations by tax authorities that examine tax returns filed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 

Refer to Note 13 &#32;to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;for the year-to-year comparison of the ETR.

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Consumer Loans Secured By Real Estate 

Consumer loans secured by real estate decreased &#32; $310.7 million , or 2.3% , from December 31, 2019 &#32;to March 31, 2020 . This decrease was comprised of a decrease &#32;in the residential mortgage portfolio of $224.7 million &#32;and a decrease &#32;in the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio of $86.1 million . 

Consumer Loans Not Secured By Real Estate 

RICs and auto loans 

RICs and auto loans increased &#32; $235.6 million , or 0.6% , from December 31, 2019 &#32;to March 31, 2020 . The increase &#32;in the RIC and auto loan portfolio was primarily due to an increase &#32;of purchased financial receivables from third-party lenders and originations, net of securitizations. RICs are collateralized by vehicle titles, and the lender has the right to repossess the vehicle in the event the consumer defaults on the payment terms of the contract. Most of the Company's RICs held for investment are pledged against warehouse lines or securitization bonds. Refer to further discussion of these in Note 10 &#32;to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . 

As of March 31, 2020 , 66.2% &#32;of the Company's RIC and auto loan portfolio balance was comprised of nonprime loans (defined by the Company as customers with a FICO score of below 640) with customers who did not qualify for conventional consumer finance products as a result of, among other things, a lack of or adverse credit history, low income levels and/or the inability to provide adequate down payments. This also includes 8.7% &#32;of loans for which no FICO is available or legacy portfolios for which FICO is not considered in the ALLL model. While underwriting guidelines are designed to establish that the customer would be a reasonable credit risk, nonprime loans will nonetheless experience higher default rates than a portfolio of obligations of prime customers. Additionally, higher unemployment rates, higher gasoline prices, unstable real estate values, re-sets of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates, the general availability of consumer credit, and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could lead to an increase in delinquencies, defaults, and repossessions, as well as decreased consumer demand for used automobiles and other consumer products, weaken collateral values and increase losses in the event of default. Because SC's historical focus for such credit has been predominantly on nonprime consumers, the actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses on these loans could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn. 

The Company's automated originations process for these credits reflects a disciplined approach to credit risk management to mitigate the risks of nonprime customers. The Company's robust historical data on both organically originated and acquired loans provides it with the ability to perform advanced loss forecasting. Each applicant is automatically assigned a proprietary custom score using information such as FICO scores, DTI ratios, LTV ratios, and over 30 other predictive factors, placing the applicant in one of 100 pricing tiers. The pricing in each tier is continuously monitored and adjusted to reflect market and risk trends. In addition to the Company's automated process, it maintains a team of underwriters for manual review, consideration of exceptions, and review of deal structures with dealers. 

At March 31, 2020 , a typical RIC was originated with an average annual percentage rate of 15.3% &#32;and was purchased from the dealer at a premium of 0.8% . All of the Company's RICs and auto loans are fixed-rate loans. 

The Company records an ALLL to cover its estimate of inherent losses on its RICs incurred as of the balance sheet date. 

Personal unsecured and other consumer loans 

Personal unsecured and other consumer loans decreased &#32;from December 31, 2019 &#32;to March 31, 2020 &#32;by $95.1 million . 

As a result of the strategic evaluation of SC's personal lending portfolio, in the third quarter of 2015, SC began reviewing strategic alternatives for exiting its personal loan portfolios. SC's other significant personal lending relationship is with Bluestem. SC continues to perform in accordance with the terms and operative provisions of the agreements under which it is obligated to purchase personal revolving loans originated by Bluestem for a term ending in 2020, or 2022 if extended at Bluestem's option. The Bluestem loan portfolio is carried as held-for-sale in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . Accordingly, the Company has recorded lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments on this portfolio, and there may be further such adjustments required in future period financial statements. Management is currently evaluating alternatives for the Bluestem portfolio. As of March 31, 2020 , SC's personal unsecured portfolio was held-for-sale and thus does not have a related allowance.

The increase in the ALLL as a percentage of total NPLs is a result of the adoption of the CECL standard effective January 1, 2020. 

Potential problem loans are loans not currently classified as NPLs for which management has doubts about the borrowers&#8217; ability to comply with the present repayment terms. These assets are principally loans delinquent for more than 30 days but less than 90 days. Potential problem commercial loans totaled approximately $290.8 million &#32;and $179.9 million &#32;at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. This increase was due to loans to three large borrowers within the CRE, Multifamily, and other Commercial portfolios. 

Potential problem consumer loans amounted to $4.1 billion &#32;and $4.7 billion &#32;at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. Management has included these loans in its evaluation of the Company's ACL and reserved for them during the respective periods. 

Non-performing assets decreased to $2.3 billion , or 1.5% &#32;of total assets, at March 31, 2020 , compared to $2.5 billion , or 1.6% &#32;of total assets, at December 31, 2019 , primarily attributable to a decrease in in consumer RIC NPLs due to seasonality as consumers pay off outstanding balances. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Commercial 

Commercial NPLs decreased &#32; $37.6 million &#32;from December 31, 2019 &#32;to March 31, 2020 . Commercial NPLs accounted for 0.6% &#32;and 0.7% &#32;of commercial LHFI at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. The decrease in commercial NPLs was comprised of decreases of $47.1 million &#32;in C&#38;I offset by $12.8 million &#32;in the Multifamily portfolio. 

Consumer Loans Not Secured by Real Estate 

RICs and amortizing personal loans are classified as non-performing when they are more than 60 DPD (i.e., 61 or more DPD) with respect to principal or interest. Except for loans accounted for using the FVO, at the time a loan is placed on non-performing status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income. When an account is 60 days or less past due, it is returned to performing status and the Company returns to accruing interest on the loan. The accrual of interest on revolving personal loans continues until the loan is charged off. 

RIC TDRs are placed on non-accrual status when the account becomes past due more than 60 days. For loans in non-accrual status, interest income is recognized on a cash basis. For loans on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest is resumed if a delinquent account subsequently becomes 60 days or less past due. NPLs in the RIC and auto loan portfolio decreased &#32;by $145.3 million &#32;from December 31, 2019 &#32;to March 31, 2020 . Non-performing RICs and auto loans accounted for 4.1% &#32;and 4.5% &#32;of total RICs and auto loans at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively.

The NPL ratio is usually higher for the Company's residential mortgage loan portfolio compared to the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio due to a number of factors, including the prolonged workout and foreclosure resolution processes for residential mortgage loans, differences in risk profiles, and mortgage loans located outside the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States. As of March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019, the lower percentage of NPLs in the residential mortgage portfolio is due to the NPL loan sale in 2019.

Delinquencies 

The Company generally considers an account delinquent when an obligor fails to pay substantially all (defined as 90%) of the scheduled payment by the due date. 

Overall, total delinquencies decrease d by $418.8 million , or 7.3% , from December 31, 2019 &#32;to March 31, 2020 , primarily driven by RICs and auto loans, which decrease d $560.1 million , offset by other consumer and multifamily loans, which increase d by $8.7 million &#32;and $48.2 million , respectively. 

TDRs 

TDRs are loans that have been modified as the Company has agreed to make certain concessions to both meet the needs of customers and maximize its ultimate recovery on the loans. TDRs occur when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties and the loan is modified with terms that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower. The types of concessions granted are generally interest rate reductions, limitations on accrued interest charged, term extensions, and deferments of principal. 

TDRs are generally placed on nonaccrual status upon modification, unless the loan was performing immediately prior to modification. For most portfolios, TDRs may return to accrual status after a sustained period of repayment performance, as long as the Company believes the principal and interest of the restructured loan will be paid in full. RIC TDRs are placed on nonaccrual status when the Company believes repayment under the revised terms is not reasonably assured, and at the latest, when the account becomes more than 60 DPD. RIC TDRs are considered for return to accrual when the account becomes 60 days or less past due. To the extent the TDR is determined to be collateral-dependent and the source of repayment depends on the operation of the collateral, the loan may be returned to accrual status based on the foregoing parameters. To the extent the TDR is determined to be collateral-dependent and the source of repayment depends on disposal of the collateral, the loan may not be returned to accrual status. 

The following table summarizes TDRs at the dates indicated:

New TDRs includes drawdowns on lines of credit that have previously been classified as TDRs. 

The Company is actively working with its borrowers who have been impacted by the COVID-19 and have developed loan modification programs to mitigate the adverse effects of COVID-19 to our loan customers. The predominant program offering is a two to three month deferral of payments to the end of the loan term and waiver of late charges. We have experienced a sharp increase in requests for extensions and modifications related to COVID-19 nationwide and a significant number of such extensions and modifications have been granted. 

On March 22, 2020, the federal banking regulatory agencies issued an &#8220;Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus.&#8221; This guidance encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers that may be unable to meet their contractual obligations because of the effects of COVID-19. The guidance goes on to explain that, in consultation with the FASB staff, the federal banking regulatory agencies conclude that short-term modifications (e.g. six months) made on a good faith basis to borrowers who were impacted by COVID-19 and who were less than 30 days past due as of the implementation date of a relief program are not TDRs. The Company applied this guidance to modifications executed on loans following the COVID-19 outbreak. 

Historically, the majority of deferrals on retail installment contracts are approved for borrowers who are either 31-60 or 61-90 days delinquent, however a majority of these COVID-19 specific extensions have been granted to borrowers who were less than 30 days past due at the implementation date of the Company's COVID-19 modification program. 

The Company also revised its servicing practices related to extensions offered to customers on its RICs. In accordance with the Company&#8217;s policies and guidelines, the Company may offer extensions (deferrals) to consumers on its RICs, whereby the consumer is allowed to move a maximum of three payments per event to the end of the loan. The Company&#8217;s policies and guidelines limit the frequency of each new deferral that may be granted to one deferral every six months, regardless of the length of any prior deferral. The maximum number of lifetime months extended for all automobile RICs was eight, while some marine and recreational vehicle contracts had a maximum of twelve months extended to reflect their longer term. In March 2020, the Company revised its servicing practices related to the maximum number of extensions to increase the permitted number of monthly extensions from eight to twelve and to increase the maximum number of months per extension from two to three. Additionally, the Company generally limits the granting of deferrals on new accounts until a requisite number of payments has been received. During the deferral period, the Company continues to accrue and collect interest on the loan in accordance with the terms of the deferral agreement. 

The Company evaluates the results of its deferral strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred compared to the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time. Based on this evaluation, the Company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio. 

Changes in deferral levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of consumer finance receivables charged off. However, the timing of a charge-off may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge-off. To the extent deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged off, historical charge-off ratios, loss confirmation periods, and cash flow forecasts used in the determination of the adequacy of the ALLL for loans classified as TDRs are also impacted. Increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the ALLL and related credit loss expense. Changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of the ALLL and related credit loss expense. For loans that are classified as TDRs, the Company generally compares the present value of expected cash flows to the outstanding recorded investment of TDRs to determine the amount of allowance and related credit loss expense that should be recorded. For loans that are considered collateral-dependent, such as certain bankruptcy modifications, impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral, less its estimated costs to sell. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

CREDIT RISK 

The risk inherent in the Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolios is driven by credit and collateral quality, and is affected by borrower-specific and economy-wide facts such as changes in employment, GDP, HPI, CRE price index, used car prices, and other factors. In general, there is an inverse relationship between credit quality of transactions and projections of impairment losses so that transactions with better credit quality require a lower expected loss. The Company manages this risk through its underwriting, pricing and credit approval guidelines and servicing policies and practices, as well as geographic and other concentration limits. 

The Company's ACL is principally based on various models subject to the Company's Model Risk Management Framework. New models are approved by the Company's Model Risk Management Committee. Models, inputs and documentation are further reviewed and validated at least annually, and the Company completes a detailed variance analysis of historical model projections against actual observed results on a quarterly basis. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its ACL Committee. 

Management uses the qualitative framework to exercise judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and that are not considered by the quantitative framework. These adjustments are documented and reviewed through the Company&#8217;s risk management processes. Furthermore, management reviews, updates, and validates its process and loss assumptions on a periodic basis. This process involves an analysis of data integrity, review of loss and credit trends, a retrospective evaluation of actual loss information to loss forecasts, and other analyses. 

ACL levels are collectively reviewed for adequacy and approved quarterly. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its ACL Committee. The ACL levels are approved by the Board-level committees quarterly. 

ACL 

Changes to the ACL are discussed in Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments 

The reserve for unfunded lending commitments increased &#32;from $91.8 million &#32;at December 31, 2019 &#32;to $169.9 million &#32;at March 31, 2020 . The increase of the reserve for unfunded included an increase from the adoption of the CECL standard of $10.4 million while the remainder was primarily related to changes in the business environment resulting from COVID-19. The net impact of business as usual change in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments to the overall ACL was immaterial . 

INVESTMENT SECURITIES 

Investment securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasuries, MBS, ABS and FHLB and FRB stock. MBS consist of pass-through, CMOs and adjustable rate mortgages issued by federal agencies. The Company&#8217;s MBS are either guaranteed as to principal and interest by the issuer or have ratings of &#8220;AAA&#8221; by S&#38;P and Moody&#8217;s at the date of issuance. The Company&#8217;s AFS investment strategy is to purchase liquid fixed-rate and floating-rate investments to manage the Company's liquidity position and interest rate risk adequately. 

Total investment securities AFS decreased $2.0 billion to $12.3 billion &#32;at March 31, 2020 , compared to $14.3 billion &#32;at December 31, 2019 . During the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 , the composition of the Company's investment portfolio changed due to a decrease in U.S. Treasury securities and MBS. U.S. Treasuries decreased by $1.7 billion &#32; primarily due to investment sales and maturities. MBS decreased by $376.3 million &#32;primarily due to investment sales, maturities and principal paydowns, partially offset by investment purchases and an increase in unrealized gains. For additional information with respect to the Company&#8217;s investment securities, see Note 3 &#32;to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . 

Debt securities for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity are classified as HTM securities. HTM securities are reported at cost and adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount. Total investment securities HTM were $4.4 billion &#32;at March 31, 2020 . The Company had 107 &#32;investment securities classified as HTM as of March 31, 2020 . 

Total gross unrealized gain/(loss) position on investment securities AFS increased by $262.9 million &#32;during the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 . This increase was primarily related to an increase in unrealized gains of $244.0 million &#32;on MBS, primarily due to a decrease in interest rates. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The average life of the AFS investment portfolio (excluding certain ABS) at March 31, 2020 &#32;was approximately 3.42 years. The average effective duration of the investment portfolio (excluding certain ABS) at March 31, 2020 &#32;was approximately 2.16 &#32;years. The actual maturities of MBS AFS will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

GOODWILL 

The Company records the excess of the cost of acquired entities over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired less the fair value of liabilities assumed as goodwill. Consistent with ASC 350, the Company does not amortize goodwill, and reviews the goodwill recorded for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the potential for goodwill impairment. At March 31, 2020 , goodwill totaled $4.4 billion &#32;and represented 2.9% &#32;of total assets and 20.0% &#32;of total stockholder's equity.

The Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment tests as of October 1, 2019 &#32;using generally accepted valuation methods. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The Company completes a quarterly review for impairment indicators over each of its reporting units, which includes consideration of economic and organizational factors that could impact the fair value of the Company's reporting units. As disclosed in footnote 7 to these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company determined that a goodwill triggering event occurred in the CBB reporting unit during the first quarter of 2020. For the CBB reporting unit's first quarter fair valuation analysis, a weighting of 25% to the market approach and 75% to the income approach was applied. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate of 9.1%, which represents management's best estimate of the rate of return expected by market participants and aligns with the reporting units's cost of equity at the time of the analysis. The Company increased a component of the discount rate to reflect the risk and uncertainty related to the reporting unit&#8217;s projected cash flows, which were adjusted downward from the Company's year-end financial plan as a result of the estimated economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Long-term growth rates of 3.0-3.5% were applied in determining the terminal value. For the market approach, the Company selected a 35%- 40% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the market place that were determined to be comparable during periods of distressed market conditions. The equity value as a multiple of tangible book value of 1.1x was selected based on publicly traded peers of the reporting unit. The results of the fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the CBB reporting unit by less than 5.0% in the scenarios deemed by the Company to be most likely, indicating the reporting unit was not considered to be impaired at March 31, 2020. The Company will continue monitoring changes to all reporting units for potential impairment indicators in 2020. There is an increased risk that an impairment, up to the amount of remaining goodwill, could be recognized based on continued or additional declines in the market in future periods. 

DEFERRED TAXES AND OTHER TAX ACTIVITY 

The Company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $326.8 million &#32;at March 31, 2020 &#32;(consisting of a deferred tax asset balance of $617.0 million &#32;and a deferred tax liability balance of $943.8 million ), compared to a net deferred tax liability balance of $1.0 billion &#32;at December 31, 2019 &#32;(consisting of a deferred tax asset balance of $503.7 million &#32;and a deferred tax liability balance of $1.5 billion ). The $690.6 million &#160; decrease &#32;in net deferred liabilities for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 &#32;was primarily due to the adoption of the CECL Standard. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

BANK REGULATORY CAPITAL 

The Company's capital priorities are to support client growth and business investment while maintaining appropriate capital in light of economic uncertainty and the Basel III framework. 

The Company is subject to the regulations of certain federal, state, and foreign agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities. At March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , based on the Bank&#8217;s capital calculations, the Bank was considered well-capitalized under the applicable capital framework. In addition, the Company's capital levels as of March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , based on the Company&#8217;s capital calculations, exceeded the required capital ratios for BHCs. 

For a discussion of Basel III, which became effective for SHUSA and the Bank on January 1, 2015 , including the standardized approach and related future changes to the minimum U.S. regulatory capital ratios, see the section captioned "Regulatory Matters" in this MD&#38;A. 

Federal banking laws, regulations and policies also limit the Bank's ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to the Company. The Bank must obtain prior OCC approval to declare a dividend or make any other capital distribution if, after such dividend or distribution: (1) the Bank's total distributions to SHUSA within that calendar year would exceed 100% of its net income during the year plus retained net income for the prior two years, (2) the Bank would not meet capital levels imposed by the OCC in connection with any order, or (3) the Bank is not adequately capitalized at the time. The OCC's prior approval would also be required if the Bank were notified by the OCC that it is a problem institution or in troubled condition. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Any dividend declared and paid or return of capital has the effect of reducing capital ratios. During the three-month periods ended &#32; March 31, 2020 &#32;and 2019 , the Company paid cash dividends of $125.0 million , and $75.0 million , respectively, to its common stock shareholder.

I n February 2019, the Federal Reserve announced that the Company, as well as other less complex firms, would receive a one-year extension of the requirement to submit its results for the supervisory capital stress tests until April 5, 2020. The Federal Reserve also announced that, for the period beginning on July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, the Company would be allowed to make capital distributions up to an amount that would have allowed the Company to remain well-capitalized under the minimum capital requirements for CCAR 2018. 

In June 2019, the Company announced its planned capital actions for the period from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020. These planned capital actions are: (1) common stock dividends of $125 million per quarter from SHUSA to Santander, (2) common stock dividends paid by SC, and (3) an authorization to repurchase up to $1.1 billion of SC&#8217;s outstanding common stock. Refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section below for discussion of the capital actions taken, including SC&#8217;s share repurchase plans and activities. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Overall 

The Company continues to maintain strong liquidity. Liquidity represents the ability of the Company to obtain cost-effective funding to meet the needs of customers as well as the Company's financial obligations. Factors that impact the liquidity position of the Company include loan origination volumes, loan prepayment rates, the maturity structure of existing loans, core deposit growth levels, CD maturity structure and retention, the Company's credit ratings, investment portfolio cash flows, the maturity structure of the Company's wholesale funding, and other factors. These risks are monitored and managed centrally. The Company's Asset/Liability Committee reviews and approves the Company's liquidity policy and guidelines on a regular basis. This process includes reviewing all available wholesale liquidity sources. The Company also forecasts future liquidity needs and develops strategies to ensure adequate liquidity is available at all times. SHUSA conducts monthly liquidity stress test analyses to manage its liquidity under a variety of scenarios, all of which demonstrate that the Company has ample liquidity to meet its short-term and long-term cash requirements. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Further changes to the credit ratings of SHUSA, Santander and its affiliates or the Kingdom of Spain could have a material adverse effect on SHUSA's business, including its liquidity and capital resources. The credit ratings of SHUSA have changed in the past and may change in the future, which could impact its cost of and access to sources of financing and liquidity. Any reductions in the long-term or short-term credit ratings of SHUSA would increase its borrowing costs and require it to replace funding lost due to the downgrade, which may include the loss of customer deposits, limit its access to capital and money markets and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivatives contracts and other secured funding arrangements. See further discussion on the impacts of credit ratings actions in the "Economic and Business Environment" section of this MD&#38;A. 

Sources of Liquidity 

Company and Bank 

The Company and the Bank have several sources of funding to meet liquidity requirements, including the Bank's core deposit base, liquid investment securities portfolio, ability to acquire large deposits, FHLB borrowings, wholesale deposit purchases, and federal funds purchased, as well as through securitizations in the ABS market and committed credit lines from third-party banks and Santander. In addition, the Company has other sources of funding to meet its liquidity requirements such as dividends and returns of investments from its subsidiaries, short-term investments held by non-bank affiliates, and access to the capital markets. 

SC 

SC requires a significant amount of liquidity to originate and acquire loans and leases and to service debt. SC funds its operations through its lending relationships with 13 &#32;third-party banks, SHUSA, and through securitizations in the ABS market and flow agreements. SC seeks to issue debt that appropriately matches the cash flows of the assets that it originates. SC has more than $5.1 billion &#32;of stockholders&#8217; equity that supports its access to the securitization markets, credit facilities, and flow agreements. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , SC completed on-balance sheet funding transactions totaling approximately $4.0 billion , including: 

&#8226; 

securitizations on its DRIVE, deeper subprime platform, for approximately $1.1 billion ; 

&#8226; 

lease securitizations on its SRT platform for approximately $1.1 billion ; 

&#8226; 

private amortizing lease facilities for approximately $1.8 billion ; and 

&#8226; 

issuance of a retained bond on its SRT platform for approximately $52.6 million . 

For information regarding SC's debt, see Note 10 &#32;to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . 

IHC 

On June 6, 2017, SIS entered into a revolving subordinated loan agreement with SHUSA not to exceed $290.0 million &#32;for a two-year term to mature in 2019. On October 16, 2018, the revolving loan agreement was increased to $895.0 million . 

As needed, SIS will draw down from another subordinated loan with Santander in order to enable SIS to underwrite certain large transactions in excess of the subordinated loan described above. At March 31, 2020 , there was no outstanding balance on the subordinated loan. 

BSI's primary sources of liquidity are from customer deposits and deposits from affiliated banks. 

BSPR's primary sources of liquidity include core deposits, FHLB borrowings, wholesale and/or brokered deposits, and liquid investment securities. 

Institutional borrowings 

The Company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress scenarios, and maintains contingency plans consistent with the Company&#8217;s access to diversified sources of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources. These include cash, unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow at the FHLB and the FRB&#8217;s discount window. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Available Liquidity 

As of March 31, 2020 , the Bank had approximately $20.3 billion &#32;in committed liquidity from the FHLB and the FRB. Of this amount, $11.2 billion &#32;was unused and therefore provides additional borrowing capacity and liquidity for the Company. At March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents and LHFS) and securities AFS exclusive of securities pledged as collateral) totaled approximately $16.1 billion &#32;and $15.0 billion , respectively. These amounts represented 26.0% &#32;and 24.3% &#32;of total deposits at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , respectively. As of March 31, 2020 , the Bank, BSI and BSPR had $1.1 billion , $2.5 billion , and $916.1 million , respectively, in cash held at the FRB. Management believes that the Company has ample liquidity to fund its operations. 

BSPR has $614.9 million &#32;in committed liquidity from the FHLB, all of which was unused as of March 31, 2020 , as well as $2.0 billion &#32;in liquid assets aside from cash unused as of March 31, 2020 .

For the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2019 , net cash flow from investing activities was $(3.5) billion , primarily due to $2.7 billion &#32;in normal loan activity, $787.4 million &#32;of purchases of investment securities AFS, and $2.0 billion &#32;in operating lease purchases and originations, partially offset by $1.1 billion &#32;of AFS investment securities sales, maturities and prepayments and $875.0 million &#32;in proceeds from sales and terminations of operating leases. 

Cash flows from financing activities 

For the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 , net cash flow from financing activities was $3.1 billion , which was primarily due to an increase &#32;in net borrowing activity of $2.3 billion &#32;and a $1.3 billion &#32; increase &#32;in deposits, partially offset by $125.0 million &#32;in dividends paid on common stock and $468.5 million &#32;in stock repurchases attributable to NCI. 

Net cash flow from financing activities for the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2019 &#32;was $2.1 billion , which was primarily due to an increase &#32;in net borrowing activity of $683.0 million &#32;and a $1.4 billion &#32; increase &#32;in deposits, partially offset by $75.0 million &#32;in dividends paid on common stock. 

See the SCF for further details on the Company's sources and uses of cash. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Credit Facilities 

Third-Party Revolving Credit Facilities 

Warehouse Lines 

SC uses warehouse facilities to fund its originations. Each facility specifies the required collateral characteristics, collateral concentrations, credit enhancement, and advance rates. SC's warehouse facilities generally are backed by auto RICs or auto leases. These facilities generally have one- or two-year commitments, staggered maturities and floating interest rates. SC maintains daily and long-term funding forecasts for originations, acquisitions, and other large outflows such as tax payments to balance the desire to minimize funding costs with its liquidity needs. 

SC's warehouse facilities generally have net spread, delinquency, and net loss ratio limits. Generally, these limits are calculated based on the portfolio collateralizing the respective line; however, for certain of SC's warehouse facilities, delinquency and net loss ratios are calculated with respect to its serviced portfolio as a whole. Failure to meet any of these covenants could trigger increased overcollateralization requirements or, in the case of limits calculated with respect to the specific portfolio underlying certain credit lines, result in an event of default under these agreements. If an event of default occurred under one of these agreements, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the impacted agreement to be immediately due and payable, enforce their interests against collateral pledged under the agreement, restrict SC's ability to obtain additional borrowings under the agreement, and/or remove SC as servicer. SC has never had a warehouse facility terminated due to failure to comply with any ratio or a failure to meet any covenant. A default under one of these agreements can be enforced only with respect to the impacted warehouse facility. 

SC has one &#32;credit facility with eight &#32;banks providing an aggregate commitment of $4.0 billion &#32;for the exclusive use of providing short-term liquidity needs to support Chrysler Finance lease financing. As of March 31, 2020 , there was an outstanding balance of approximately $1.5 billion &#32;on this facility in the aggregate. The facility requires reduced advance rates in the event of delinquency, credit loss, or residual loss ratios, as well as other metrics exceeding specified thresholds. 

SC has eight &#32;credit facilities with ten &#32;banks providing an aggregate commitment of $7.5 billion &#32;for the exclusive use of providing short-term liquidity needs to support core and Chrysler Capital loan financing. As of March 31, 2020 , there was an outstanding balance of approximately $4.7 billion &#32;on these facilities in the aggregate. These facilities reduced advance rates in the event of delinquency, credit loss, as well as various other metrics exceeding specific thresholds. 

Repurchase Agreements 

SC also obtains financing through investment management or repurchase agreements under which it pledges retained subordinate bonds on its own securitizations as collateral for repurchase agreements with various borrowers and at renewable terms ranging up to 365 &#32;days. As of March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 , there were outstanding balances of $313.6 million &#32;and $422.3 million , respectively, under these repurchase agreements. 

SHUSA Lending to SC 

The Company provides SC with $3.0 billion &#32;of committed revolving credit that can be drawn on an unsecured basis. The Company also provides SC with $5.7 billion &#32;of term promissory notes with maturities ranging from May 2020 &#32;to July 2024 . These loans eliminate in the consolidation of SHUSA. 

Secured Structured Financings 

SC's secured structured financings primarily consist of both public, SEC-registered securitizations, as well as private securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, and privately issues amortizing notes. SC has on-balance sheet securitizations outstanding in the market with a cumulative ABS balance of approximately $28.0 billion . 

Flow Agreements 

In addition to SC's credit facilities and secured structured financings, SC has a flow agreement in place with a third party for charged-off assets. Loans and leases sold under these flow agreements are not on SC's balance sheet, but provide a stable stream of servicing fee income and may also provide a gain or loss on sale. SC continues to actively seek additional flow agreements. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing 

Beginning in 2017, SC had the option to sell a contractually determined amount of eligible prime loans to Santander through securitization platforms. As all of the notes and residual interests in the securitizations are acquired by Santander, SC recorded these transactions as true sales of the RICs securitized, and removed the sold assets from its consolidated balance sheets. Beginning in 2018, this program was replaced with a new program with SBNA, whereby SC has agreed to provide SBNA with origination support services in connection with the processing, underwriting, and purchasing of retail loans, primarily from FCA dealers, all of which are serviced by SC. 

Uses of Liquidity 

The Company uses liquidity for debt service and repayment of borrowings, as well as for funding loan commitments and satisfying deposit withdrawal requests. 

SIS uses liquidity primarily to support underwriting transactions. 

The primary use of liquidity for BSI is to meet customer liquidity requirements, such as maturing deposits, investment activities, funds transfers, and payment of operating expenses. 

BSPR uses liquidity for funding loan commitments and satisfying deposit withdrawal requests. 

At March 31, 2020 , the Company's liquidity to meet debt payments, debt service and debt maturities was in excess of 12 months. 

Dividends, Contributions and Stock Issuances 

As of March 31, 2020 , the Company had 530,391,043 &#32;shares of common stock outstanding. During the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 , the Company paid dividends of $125.0 million &#32;to its sole shareholder, Santander. 

SC paid a dividend of $0.22 &#32;per share in February 2020. Further, SC declared a cash dividend of $0.22 &#32;per share, to be paid on May 18, 2020 , to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 8, 2020 . SC has paid a total of $74.6 million &#32;in dividends through March 31, 2020 , of which $20.6 million &#32;has been paid to NCI and $54.0 million &#32;has been paid to the Company, which eliminates in the consolidated results of the Company. 

In June 2019, SC announced that the SC Board of Directors had authorized purchases by SC of up to $1.1 billion , excluding commissions, of outstanding SC Common Stock effective from the third quarter of 2019 through the end of the second quarter of 2020. 

During the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 , SC purchased a total of 18.4 million &#32;shares of SC Common Stock through a tender offer and other share repurchase program at a total cost of approximately $467 million , excluding commissions. Through a tender offer, SC purchased 17.5 million &#32;shares of SC Common Stock, $0.01 &#32;par value per share, at a price of $26 &#32;per share, for an aggregate cost of approximately $455 million , excluding fees and expenses related to the tender offer. Under its share repurchase program, SC purchased 846.5 thousand &#32;shares of SC Common Stock at a cost of approximately $12 million , excluding commissions. After the completion of the tender offer, SHUSA's ownership in SC had increased to approximately 76.3% . 

During the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2019 , SC purchased 965.4 thousand &#32;shares of SC Common Stock under its share repurchase program at a cost of approximately $18 million , excluding commissions. 

During the three-month period ended &#32; March 31, 2020 , SHUSA's subsidiaries had the following capital activity which eliminated in consolidation: 

&#8226; 

BSI declared and paid $7.5 million &#32;in dividends to SHUSA.

(1) 

Includes interest on both fixed and variable rate obligations. The interest associated with variable rate obligations is based on interest rates in effect at March 31, 2020 . The contractual amounts to be paid on variable rate obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates. Future changes in market interest rates could materially affect the contractual amounts to be paid. 

(2) 

Includes all carrying value adjustments, such as unamortized premiums and discounts and hedge basis adjustments. 

(3) 

Does not include future expected sublease income or interest of $79.1 million . 

Excluded from the above table are deposits of $61.2 billion &#32;that are due on demand by customers. 

The Company is a party to financial instruments and other arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. See further discussion on these risks in Note 12 &#32;and Note 16 &#32;to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . 

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT 

Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Company&#8217;s traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in market interest rates, and consumer preferences, affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Interest rate risk is managed by the Company's Treasury group and measured by its Market Risk Department, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Committee. In managing interest rate risk, the Company seeks to minimize the variability of net interest income across various likely scenarios, while at the same time maximizing 

net interest income and the net interest margin. To achieve these objectives, the Treasury group works closely with each business line in the Company. The Treasury group also uses various other tools to manage interest rate risk, including wholesale funding maturity targeting, investment portfolio purchase strategies, asset securitizations/sales, and financial derivatives. 

Interest rate risk focuses on managing four elements of risk associated with interest rates: basis risk, repricing risk, yield curve risk and option risk. Basis risk stems from rate index timing differences with rate changes, such as differences in the extent of changes in Federal funds rates compared with the three-month LIBOR. Repricing risk stems from the different timing of contractual repricing, such as one-month versus three-month reset dates, as well as the related maturities. Yield curve risk stems from the impact on earnings and market value resulting from different shapes and levels of yield curves. Option risk stems from prepayment or early withdrawal risk embedded in various products. These four elements of risk are analyzed through a combination of net interest income and balance sheet valuation simulations, shocks to those simulations, and scenario and market value analyses, and the subsequent results are reviewed by management. Numerous assumptions are made to produce these analyses, including assumptions about new business volumes, loan and investment prepayment rates, deposit flows, interest rate curves, economic conditions and competitor pricing.

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis 

The Company utilizes a variety of measurement techniques to evaluate the impact of interest rate risk, including simulating the impact of changing interest rates on expected future interest income and interest expense, to estimate the Company's net interest income sensitivity. This simulation is run monthly and includes various scenarios that help management understand the potential risks in the Company's net interest income sensitivity. These scenarios include both parallel and non-parallel rate shocks as well as other scenarios that are consistent with quantifying the four elements of risk described above. This information is used to develop proactive strategies to ensure that the Company&#8217;s risk position remains within SHUSA Board of Directors-approved limits so that future earnings are not significantly adversely affected by future interest rates. 

The table below reflects the estimated sensitivity to the Company&#8217;s net interest income based on interest rate changes at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 :

MVE Analysis 

The Company also evaluates the impact of interest rate risk by utilizing MVE modeling. This analysis measures the present value of all estimated future cash flows of the Company over the estimated remaining life of the balance sheet. MVE is calculated as the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities. The MVE calculation utilizes only the current balance sheet, and therefore does not factor in any future changes in balance sheet size, balance sheet mix, yield curve relationships or product spreads, which may mitigate the impact of any interest rate changes. 

Management examines the effect of interest rate changes on MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk, and highlights the potential capital at risk due to adverse changes in market interest rates. The following table discloses the estimated sensitivity to the Company&#8217;s MVE at March 31, 2020 &#32;and December 31, 2019 .

As of March 31, 2020 , the Company&#8217;s profile reflected a decrease of MVE of 3.70% &#32;for downward parallel interest rate shocks of 100 basis points and an increase of 0.10% &#32;for upward parallel interest rate shocks of 100 basis points. The asymmetrical sensitivity between up 100 and down 100 shock is due to the negative convexity as a result of the prepayment option embedded in mortgage-related products, the impact of which is not fully offset by the behavior of the funding base (largely NMDs). 

In downward parallel interest rate shocks, mortgage-related products&#8217; prepayments increase, their duration decreases and their market value appreciation is therefore limited. At the same time, with deposit rates remaining at comparatively low levels, the Company cannot effectively transfer interest rate declines to its NMD customers. For upward parallel interest rate shocks, extension risk weighs on a sizable portion of the Company&#8217;s mortgage-related products, which are predominantly long-term and fixed-rate; and for larger shocks, the loss in market value is not offset by the change in NMD. 

Limitations of Interest Rate Risk Analyses 

Since the assumptions used are inherently uncertain, the Company cannot predict precisely the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or MVE. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, the difference between actual experience and the assumed volume, characteristics of new business, behavior of existing positions, and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among other factors.

Uses of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks 

To mitigate interest rate risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange, equity and credit risks, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income, the fair value of assets and liabilities, and cash flows. 

Through the Company&#8217;s capital markets and mortgage banking activities, it is subject to price risk. The Company employs various tools to measure and manage price risk in its portfolios. In addition, SHUSA's Board of Directors has established certain limits relative to positions and activities. The level of price risk exposure at any point in time depends on the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements, and will vary from period to period. 

Management uses derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate movements on the fair value of certain liabilities, assets and highly probable forecasted cash flows. These instruments primarily include interest rate swaps that have underlying interest rates based on key benchmark indices and forward sale or purchase commitments. The nature and volume of the derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk depend on the level and type of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the risk management strategies for the current and anticipated interest rate environments. 

The Company's derivatives portfolio includes mortgage banking interest rate lock commitments, forward sale commitments and interest rate swaps. As part of its overall business strategy, the Bank originates residential mortgages. It sells a portion of this production to the FHLMC, the FNMA, and private investors. The Company uses forward sales as a means of hedging against the economic impact of changes in interest rates on the mortgages that are originated for sale and on interest rate lock commitments. 

The Company typically retains the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans that are sold. The majority of the Company's residential MSRs are accounted for at fair value. As deemed appropriate, the Company economically hedges MSRs, using interest rate swaps and forward contracts to purchase MBS. For additional information on MSRs, see Note 14 &#32;to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . 

The Company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Foreign exchange contracts, which include spot and forward contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. Exposure to gains and losses on these contracts increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate. 

The Company also utilizes forward contracts to manage market risk associated with certain expected investment securities sales and equity options, which manage its market risk associated with certain customer deposit products. 

For additional information on foreign exchange contracts, derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 12 &#32;to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements .
