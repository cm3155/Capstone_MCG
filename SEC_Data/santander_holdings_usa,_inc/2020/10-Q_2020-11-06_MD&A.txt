ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

SHUSA is the parent holding company of SBNA, a national banking association, and owns approximately 80.2% (as of September 30, 2020) of SC, a specialized consumer finance company. SHUSA is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and the Bank's main office is in Wilmington, D elaware. SC is headquartered in Dallas, Texas. SHUSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Santander. SHUSA is also the parent company of SSLLC, a registered broker-dealer headquartered in Boston; BSI, a financial services company headquartered in Miami that offers a full range of banking services to foreign individuals and corporations based primarily in Latin America; SIS, a registered broker-dealer headquartered in New York providing services in investment banking, institutional sales, trading and offering research reports of Latin American and European equity and fixed-income securities; and several other subsidiaries. SSLLC, SIS and another SHUSA subsidiary, SAM, are registered investment advisers with the SEC. 

The Bank's principal markets are in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States. The Bank uses its deposits, as well as other financing sources, to fund its loan and investment portfolios. The Bank earns interest income on its loan and investment portfolios. In addition, the Bank generates non-interest income from a number of sources, including deposit and loan services, sales of loans and investment securities, capital markets products and BOLI. The principal non-interest expenses include employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and facility-related costs, technology and other administrative expenses. The financial results of the Bank are affected by the economic environment, including interest rates and consumer and business confidence and spending, as well as the competitive conditions within the Bank's geographic footprint. 

SC is a specialized consumer finance company focused on vehicle finance and third-party servicing. SC's primary business is the indirect origination and securitization of RICs, principally through manufacturer-franchised dealers in connection with their sale of new and used vehicles to subprime retail consumers. Further information about SC&#8217;s business is provided below in the &#8220;Chrysler Capital&#8221; section. 

SC is managed through a single reporting segment which included vehicle financial products and services, including RICs, vehicle leases, and dealer loans, as well as financial products and services related to recreational and marine vehicles and other consumer finance products. 

SC also originates vehicle loans through a web-based direct lending program, purchases vehicle RICs from other lenders, and services automobile and recreational and marine vehicle portfolios for other lenders. Additionally, SC has other relationships through which it holds other consumer finance products. However, in 2015, SC announced its exit from personal lending and, accordingly, all of its personal lending assets are classified as LHFS at December 31, 2019. 

Since its IPO, SC has been consolidated with the Company and Santander for financial reporting and accounting purposes. Now that the Company directly owns more than 80% or more of SC Common Stock, SC is consolidated with the Company for tax filing and capital planning purposes. Among other things, tax consolidation (1) facilitates certain offsets of SC&#8217;s taxable income, (2) eliminates the double taxation of dividends from SC, and (3) triggered a release into SHUSA&#8217;s income of an approximately $306.6 million deferred tax liability recognized with respect to the GAAP basis vs. the income tax basis in the Company's ownership of SC. Tax consolidation also allows for SC's net deferred tax liability to offset the Company's net deferred tax asset, which provides a regulatory capital benefit. In addition, SHUSA and Santander recognizes a larger percentage of SC's net income. On August 10 2020, SC substantively exhausted the amount of shares the Company was permitted to repurchase under the exception SHUSA was granted to the Interim Policy, and as a result of these repurchases, SHUSA now owns approximately 80.2% of SC. SC Common Stock is listed for trading on the NYSE under the trading symbol "SC" 

Chrysler Capital 

Since May 2013, under the Chrysler Agreement, SC has operated as FCA&#8217;s preferred provider for consumer loans, leases and dealer loans and provides services to FCA customers and dealers under the Chrysler Capital brand. These products and services include consumer RICs and leases, as well as dealer loans for inventory, construction, real estate, working capital and revolving lines of credit. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Chrysler Capital continues to be a focal point of SC's strategy. On June 28, 2019, SC entered into an amendment to the Chrysler Agreement with FCA which modified the Chrysler Agreement to, among other things, adjust certain performance metrics, exclusivity commitments and payment provisions under the agreement. The amendment also established an operating framework that is mutually beneficial for both parties for the remainder of the contract. The Company's average penetration rate under the Chrysler Agreement for the third quarter of 2020 was 33%, a decrease from 36% for the same period in 2019. 

SC has dedicated financing facilities in place for its Chrysler Capital business and has worked strategically and collaboratively with FCA to continue to strengthen its relationship and create value within the Chrysler Capital program. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, SC originated $11.1 billion in Chrysler Capital loans, which represented 61% of the UPB of its total RIC originations, as well as $4.9 billion in Chrysler Capital leases. Additionally, substantially all of the leases originated by SC during nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 were under the Chrysler Agreement. 

ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 

Overview 

During the third quarter of 2020, unemployment decreased and year-to-date market results were mixed, reflecting the effects of COVID-19. 

The unemployment rate at September 30, 2020 was 7.9%, compared to 11.1% at June 30, 2020, and 3.5% one year ago. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment rose sharply in the leisure and hospitality sector. In addition, notable increases were seen in retail trade, social assistance and health services, and professional and business services. 

Market year-to-date returns for the following indices based on closing prices at September 30, 2020 were: 

September 30, 2020 Dow Jones Industrial Average (2.4)% S&#38;P 500 4.4% NASDAQ Composite 24.8% 

In light of the effects COVID-19 will have on economic activity, at its September 2020 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain the federal funds rate target range to 0.00% to 0.25%. The Committee expects to maintain this target rate until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability. This action will help support economic activity, strong labor market conditions and inflation to remain at the targeted rate of 2.0%. 

The ten-year Treasury bond rate at September 30, 2020 was 0.68%, down from 1.90% at December 31, 2019. Within the industry, changes in this metric are often considered to correspond to changes in 15-year and 30-year mortgage rates. 

Changing market conditions are considered a significant risk factor to the Company. The interest rate environment can present challenges in the growth of net interest income for the banking industry, which continues to rely on non-interest activities to support revenue growth. Changing market conditions and political uncertainty could have an overall impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Such conditions could also impact the Company's credit risk and the associated credit loss expense and legal expense .

Credit Rating Actions 

The following table presents Moody&#8217;s, S&#38;P and Fitch credit ratings for the Bank, SHUSA, and Santander senior debt / long-term issuer rating: 

SANTANDER (1) 

SHUSA SBNA Overall Outlook Fitch A BBB+ BBB+ Negative Moody's A2 Baa3 Baa1 Stable S&#38;P A BBB+ A- Negative 

(1) Senior preferred rating 

SHUSA funds its operations independently of the other entities owned by Santander, and believes its business is not necessarily closely related to the business or outlook of other entities owned by Santander. Future changes in the credit ratings of its parent, Santander, or the Kingdom of Spain, however, could impact SHUSA's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings, and any other change in the condition of Santander could affect SHUSA. 

At this time, SC is not rated by the major credit rating agencies. 

Impacts of COVID- 19 on our current and future financial and operating status and planning 

The current outbreak of COVID-19 has materially impacted our business, and the continuance of this pandemic or any future outbreak of any other highly contagious diseases or other public health emergency, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 

Due to the unpredictable and rapidly changing nature of this outbreak and the resulting economic distress, it is not possible to determine with certainty the ultimate impact on our results of operations or whether other currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of operations; however, certain adverse effects have already occurred or are probable. The following summarizes our current discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on the Company's current financial and operating status, as well as on its future operational and financial planning as of the date hereof: 

&#8226; Impact on workforce: The health and well-being of our colleagues and customers are a top priority for the Company. The Company has implemented business continuity plans and has followed guidelines issued by government authorities regarding social distancing and work-from-home arrangements. Currently, approximately 90-95% of the workforce continues to work from home. In addition, the Company has established a Temporary Emergency Paid Leave Program that provides employees with up to 120 hours of additional paid time off to use &#8211; either continuously or intermittently, and before exhausting other paid time off &#8211; to assist with dependent care needs related to COVID-19. Further, the Company provided $250 a week in pay premiums for frontline customer support workers to help defray additional costs incurred while working during the pandemic. 

While our business continuity plans are in place, if significant portions of our workforce, our subsidiaries' workforces, or our vendors' workforces are unable to work effectively as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, including because of illness, stay-at-home orders, facility closures, reductions in services or hours of operation, or ineffective remote work arrangements, there may be disruptions to our origination and servicing operations, which could result in reduced originations and/or collection effectiveness or impair our or our subsidiaries' ability to operate our businesses and satisfy obligations under third-party servicing agreements. Each of these scenarios could have materially adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

&#8226; Impact on services: The COVID-19 outbreak as well as state stay-at-home orders resulted in the closure of certain branches in highly affected areas within the Bank's footprint. To comply with social distancing guidelines and help minimize the spread of the coronavirus, the Bank instituted temporary changes to how it operates, including closure of certain branches and limitations on services provided to others. Certain limited service locations were only performing teller transactions- such as depositing and cashing checks and handling requests for cash withdrawals, money orders and cashier's checks - in the lobby or at the drive-through. In addition, some branches were only providing account opening and servicing with a banker by appointment only. Full and limited-service branches are limiting the number of people allowed in our locations at one time. Branch hours have been changed temporarily, with certain branches providing special hours for high-risk customers. As the quarter wore on and states changed their guidance, the Bank has resumed normal branch operations for over 90% of its current branches while maintaining applicable social distancing guidelines. Retail customers are encouraged to take advantage of mobile and online banking enabling customers to bank anytime, anywhere, for services including: checking account balances, remote check deposit, transfers, bill pay, and more. Retail customers can also utilize automated services via phone to make balance and transaction inquiries, payments on loans, transfers between accounts, stop payments, and more. Our call center remains staffed and open seven days a week to better serve our customers. Business customers can continue to utilize the business mobile banking application and business online banking to minimize the need to go to branches or exchange cash. We have developed the "Business First Coronavirus Resource Page" for our business customers during this time. 

&#8226; Impact on customers and loan and lease performance: The COVID-19 outbreak and associated economic crisis have led to negative effects on our customers. Unlike the regional impact of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, the COVID-19 outbreak is impacting customers nationwide and is expected to have a materially more significant impact on the performance of our loan and lease portfolios than even the most severe historical natural disaster. 

Closures and disruptions to businesses in the United States have led to negative effects on our customers. Similar to many other financial institutions, we have taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate our customers&#8217; COVID-19-related economic challenges. The Company is actively working with its borrowers who have been impacted by COVID-19. This unique and evolving situation has created temporary personal and financial challenges for our retail and commercial borrowers. The Company is working prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of COVID-19 and has developed loan modification and deferral programs to mitigate the adverse effects of COVID-19 to our loan customers. We have experienced a sharp increase in requests for extensions and modifications related to COVID-19 nationwide and a significant number of such extensions and modifications have been granted. The Bank also permitted fee reversals for those customers impacted by COVID-19, even if the amount exceed the allowable courtesy fee reversal. The Bank also joined other U.S. banks in providing overdrawn customers full access to their EIP by providing a temporary credit in the amount of their overdrawn balance as of the end of the day prior to receipt of the EIP, up to a limit of 5,000. To date, the Bank has provided over $3 million in temporary credits, helping nearly 10,000 customers. Beginning July 15, 2020, the Bank began removing these temporary credits from customers&#8217; accounts. 

These customer support programs, by their nature, are expected to negatively impact our financial performance and other results of operations in the near term. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected in the longer term if the COVID-19 outbreak leads us to continue to provide such programs for a significant period of time, if the number of customers experiencing hardship related directly or indirectly to the outbreak of COVID-19 increases, or if our customer support programs are not effective in mitigating the effects of COVID-19 on our customers' financial situations. Given the unpredictable nature of this situation, the nature and extent of such effects cannot be predicted at this time. 

In addition to the measures discussed above, the Bank is providing assistance for its retail customers, including helping those experiencing difficulties with loan payments, waiving fees for early CD withdrawals, refunding late payment and overdraft fees, offering credit card limit increases, and increasing cash availability limits at ATMs. The policy of a more relaxed approach to providing fee refunds in the wake of hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remains, but beginning in August the Bank began to see fewer refund requests. As a result, fee reversals are approaching pre-pandemic levels. For business banking customers, the Bank is working with customers in offering interest-only loan accommodations, and deferrals and extensions up to 90 days for customers (and deferrals up to 180 days for SBA loan customers) experiencing hardships. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The PPP, a key part of the CARES Act, authorizes loans to small businesses to help meet payroll costs and pay other eligible expenses during the COVID-19 outbreak. The program is administered by the SBA, and the loans and accrued interest are forgivable as long as the borrower uses at least 60% of the proceeds of the loan for eligible purposes, such as payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains employee and payroll levels. The original funding for the PPP was fully allocated by mid-April 2020, with additional funding made available on April 24, 2020. Original loans were originated with a two-year maturity, unless extended by mutual agreement between the lender and borrower. Loans made on or after June 5, 2020 have a five-year maturity. In July 2020, the PPP was extended through August 8, 2020. The Bank originated loans in the first and second rounds of PPP. To date, SBNA has assisted more than 12,070 business customers in receiving PPP loans for more than $1.2 billion in funding. SBNA launched a pilot of the PPP loan forgiveness application on August 14, 2020. The PPP loan forgiveness application, process, and platform are in pilot, and are currently being enhanced to account for guidance released by the U.S. Treasury and the SBA on October 8, 2020 related to PPP loans under $50,000. 

&#8226; Impact on originations, including the relationship with FCA: Since the COVID-19 outbreak, SC has partnered with FCA to la unch new incentive programs including implementing 90 day first payment deferrals and a 0% annual percentage rate for 84 months on select 2019/2020 FCA models. Today, all dealers are open and operating at full capacity; however, many are operating with a different business model (e.g. appointments only, home delivery, etc.). Third party sources are reporting a new car seasonally adjusted annual rate that is approximately 95% of pre-COVID expectations. While an economic downturn associated with the pandemic will impact sales, most dealers have developed business models that will allow them to continue operation in some capacity. 

While banking is considered an essential business in all of the Bank&#8217;s footprint states, executive orders have limited the scope of work of vendors supporting mortgage and home equity lines of credit such as appraisers, notaries, law firms, title companies and settlement agents or stopped these vendors from working altogether. As a result of these restrictions, the number of mortgages, home equity lines of credit and refinancings dec lined, for a period in certain states. While many of these restrictions have been lifted, it remains difficult to estimate the overall negative impact these limitations will have on mortgages, home equity lines of credits and refinancing as restrictions may be reinstated with rising COVID-19 numbers in the upcoming months. 

&#8226; Impact on operations: Government and regulatory authorities could also implement laws, regulations, executive orders and other guidance that allow customers to forgo making scheduled payments for some period of time, require modifications to receivables (e.g., waiving accrued interest), preclude creditors from exercising certain rights or taking certain actions with respect to collateral, including repossession or liquidation of collateral, or mandate limited operations or temporary closures of the Company or our vendors as &#8220;non-essential businesses&#8221; or otherwise. While we have business continuity plans in place, if significant portions of our or our vendors&#8217; workforces are unable to work effectively as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including because of illness, stay-at-home orders, facility closures reductions in services or hours of operation, or ineffective remote work arrangements, there may be servicing disruptions, which could result in reduced collection effectiveness or our ability to operate our business and satisfy our obligations under our third-party servicing agreements. Each of these scenarios could have negative effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

&#8226; Impact on debt and liquidity: As international trade and business activity has slowed and supply chains have been disrupted, global credit and financial markets have recently experienced, and may continue to experience significant disruption and volatility. During the first and second quarters of 2020 particularly, financial markets experienced significant declines and volatility, and such market conditions may continue and/or precede recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy. Under these circumstances, we may experience some or all of the risks related to market volatility and recessionary conditions described under the caption "We are vulnerable to disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets" in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K. 

Governmental and regulatory authorities have recently implemented fiscal and monetary policies and initiatives to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on the economy and individual businesses and households, such as the reduction of the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate to near zero in March 2020. Further, the Federal Reserve's TALF is available, if necessary, to support investment in SC's eligible ABS bonds. However, the Company does not expect to need to utilize TALF, given recent tightening in ABS credit spreads. These governmental and regulatory actions may not be successful in mitigating the adverse economic effects of COVID-19 and could affect our net interest income and reduce our profitability. Sustained adverse economic effects from the outbreak may also result in downgrades in our credit ratings or adversely affect the interest rate environment. If our access to funding is reduced or if our costs to obtain such funding significantly increases, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

The Company's liquidity comes from several primary sources outlined in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this MD&#38;A, including deposits, as well as public and financing a ctivities. During the quarter, there were no unsecured debt issuances executed by SHUSA. During the third quarter, SBNA maintained ample liquidity driven by stable deposits whereby maturing FHLB advances and Brokered CDs were not renewed, resulting in lower outstanding balances for both products. As a result, there was minimal new wholesale funding activity at SBNA over the quarter, limited to a $56.5 million brokered CD issuance in August and $700 million of additional FHLB advances in September. In addition to significant amounts of liquidity from warehouse lines and affiliate lines of credit, SC successfully continued to access the ABS market in the quarter. During the quarter SC completed on-balance sheet funding transactions totaling approximately $6.5 billion, including: private amortizing lease facilities for approximately $1.2 billion; two securitizations on its SDART platform for approximately $3.3 billion; and a $2 billion unsecured debt issuance with Santander. However, due to the evolving nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is not possible to predict whether unanticipated consequences of the pandemic will materially affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. 

&#8226; Impact on dividends: Historically the Company made dividend payments to Santander, and received dividends from the Bank and other IHC entities. The amount and size of any future dividends, however, will be subject to various factors, including the Company's capital and liquidity positions, regulatory considerations, impacts related to the COVID-19 outbreak, any accounting standards that affect capital or liquidity (including CECL), financial and operational performance, alternative uses of capital, and general market conditions, and may be changed or suspended at any time. 

&#8226; Impact on impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived and long-lived assets: The Company has analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on its financial statements, including the potential for impairment. As a result of this analysis, the Company has recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1.8 billion during the second quarter of 2020. The analysis did not indicate any impairment for the Company's loan and lease portfolios, leased vehicles, ROU assets, or other non-financial assets such as upfront fees or other intangibles. 

&#8226; Impact on communities: The Company is committed to supporting our communities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Company's non-profit foundation has begun responding to the COVID-19 crisis with $200 thousand in donations to a select group of organizations addressing community issues. 

In addition, SHUSA's ongoing support for non-profit partners providing essential services in our communities includes $15.0 million in charitable giving this year. Further SHUSA will provide $25.0 million in financing to community development financial institutions to fund small business loans and will expedite grant funding and payments where possible to help sustain nonprofit operations during this time. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

REGULATORY MATTERS 

The activities of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Bank and SC, are subject to regulation under various U.S. federal laws and regulatory agencies which impose regulations, supervise and conduct examinations, and may affect the operations and management of the Company and its ability to take certain actions, including making distributions to our parent, Santander. The Company is regulated on a consolidated basis by the Federal Reserve, including the FRB of Boston, and the CFPB. The Company's subsidiaries are further supervised by the OCC, the FRB of Atlanta, and NYDFS. As a subsidiary of the Company, SC is also subject to regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve as well as the CFPB. 

Payment of Dividends 

SHUSA is the parent holding company of SBNA and other consolidated subsidiaries, and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. SHUSA and SBNA are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including regulatory capital minimums and the requirement to remain "well-capitalized" under prompt corrective action regulations. A s a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, SC is included in various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends as described under the caption &#8220;Stress Tests and Capital Planning&#8221; in this section. Refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this MD&#38;A for detail of the capital actions of the Company and its subsidiaries during the period. 

In June 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that, due to the economic uncertainty resulting from COVID-19, it will require all large banks, including SHUSA, to update and resubmit their capital plans under new scenarios by November 2, 2020. In addition, the Federal Reserve issued the Interim Policy which includes: 

&#8226; A cap on common stock dividends that cannot exceed the average of the trailing four quarters&#8217; net income; and 

&#8226; A prohibition on share repurchases. 

The Interim Policy applied to the third quarter of 2020, and was extended into the fourth quarter by the Federal Reserve. Based on the Interim Policy and the Company&#8217;s expected average trailing four quarters of net income, the Company and SC are prohibited from paying dividends in the third quarter of 2020. SC is consolidated into SHUSA&#8217;s capital plan and therefore is subject to the Interim Policy that utilizes SHUSA&#8217;s average trailing income to determine the cap on common stock dividends. SHUSA requested an exception to the Interim Policy for SC to be able to pay dividends of up to $0.22 per share in the third quarter of 2020. The Federal Reserve granted this request, and on July 31, 2020 SC&#8217;s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share of SC Common Stock payable to shareholders of record as of August 13, 2020. This dividend was paid on August 24, 2020. SC does not currently expect to declare or pay a dividend in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

FBOs 

In February 2014, the Federal Reserve issued the Final Rule implementing certain EPS mandated by the DFA. Under the Final Rule, FBOs with over $50 billion of U.S. non-branch assets, including Santander, were required to consolidate U.S. subsidiary activities under an IHC. In addition, the Final Rule required U.S. BHCs and FBOs with at least $50 billion in total U.S. consolidated non-branch assets to be subject to EPS and heightened capital, liquidity, risk management, and stress testing requirements. Due to both its global and U.S. non-branch total consolidated asset size, Santander was subject to both of the above provisions of the Final Rule. As a result of this rule, Santander has transferred substantially all of its U.S. bank and non-bank subsidiaries previously outside the Company to the Company, which became an IHC effective July 1, 2016. 

Economic Growth Act 

In May 2018, the Economic Growth Act was signed into law. The Economic Growth Act scales back certain requirements of the DFA. In October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized a rulemaking implementing the changes required by the Economic Growth Act. The rulemaking provides a tailored approach to the EPS mandated by Section 165 of the DFA. Under the new tailored approach, banks are placed into different categories based on asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. The tailoring rule applies to both Santander and the Company. Both Santander and the Company were placed into category four of the tailoring rule. The new tailored standards are discussed further below. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules are applicable to both SHUSA and the Bank and establish a comprehensive capital framework that includes both the advanced approaches for the largest internationally active U.S. banks, formerly known as Basel II, and a standardized approach that applies to all banking organizations with over $500 million in assets. 

These rules narrow the definition of regulatory capital and establish higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and prompt corrective action thresholds that require banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank, to maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total capital ratio of 8.0% and a minimum leverage ratio, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets for the quarter, of 4.0%. A further capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above these minimum ratios was phased in effective January 1, 2019. This buffer is required for banking institutions and BHCs to avoid restrictions on their ability to make capital distributions, including paying dividends. 

These U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules include deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that MSRs and deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income are deducted from CET1 to the extent any one such category exceeds 25% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 for the Company and the Bank began on January 1, 2015 and was initially planned over three years, with a fully phased-in requirement of January 1, 2018. However, during 2017, the regulatory agencies finalized changes to the capital rules that became effective on January 1, 2018. These changes extended the current treatment and deferred the final transition provision phase-in at non-advanced approach institutions for certain capital elements, and suspended the risk weight to 100 percent for certain deferred taxes and mortgage servicing assets not disallowed from capital, in lieu of advancing to 250 percent. During 2019, the regulatory agencies approved a final rule which includes simplifications for non-advanced approaches to the generally applicable capital rules, specifically with regard to the treatment of minority interest, as well as modifying the risk-weight to 250 percent for certain deferred taxes and mortgage servicing assets not disallowed from capital. This final rule became effective on April 1, 2020. 

As described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2019, on January 1, 2020, we adopted the CECL standard, which upon adoption resulted in a reduction to our opening retained earnings balance, net of income tax, and an increase to the allowance for loan losses of approximately $2.5 billion. As also described in our Form 10-K, the U.S. banking agencies in December 2018 approved a final rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing banking organizations, including the Company, the option to phase in the day-one impact of CECL until the first quarter of 2023. In March 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The Company has elected this alternative option instead of the one described in the December 2018 rule. 

See the "Bank Regulatory Capital" section of this MD&#38;A for the Company's capital ratios under Basel III standards. The implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the Company's regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors, including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the Company. 

If capital has reached the significantly or critically undercapitalized levels, further material restrictions can be imposed, including restrictions on interest payable on accounts, dismissal of management and, in critically undercapitalized situations, appointment of a receiver or conservator. Critically undercapitalized institutions generally may not, beginning 60 days after becoming critically undercapitalized, make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt. All but well-capitalized institutions are prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvements Act and OCC regulations, institutions which are not categorized as well-capitalized or adequately-capitalized are restricted from making capital distributions, which include cash dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash- out mergers, interest payments on certain convertible debt and other transactions charged to the capital account of the institution. At September 30, 2020, the Bank met the criteria to be classified as &#8220;well-capitalized.&#8221; 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule to simplify capital rules for large banks. Under the final rule, firms' supervisory stress test results are now used to establish the size of the SCB requirement, replacing the 2.5% of risk-weighted assets component under the prior capital conservation buffer requirement. The SCB is calculated as the maximum decline in CET1 in the severely adverse scenario (subject to a 2.5% floor) plus four quarters of dividends. The rule results in new regulatory capital minimums which are equal to 4.5% of CET1 plus the SCB, any GSIB surcharge, and any countercyclical capital buffer. The GSIB buffer is applicable only to the largest and most complex firms and does not apply to SHUSA. In the event a firm falls below its new minimums, the rule imposes restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. Firms continue to submit a capital plan annually. Supervisory expectations for capital planning processes do not change under the proposal. The Company does not expect this rule to have a material impact on its current or future planned capital actions. 

Stress Testing and Capital Planning 

In October 2019, the Federal Reserve issued rules that tailor the stress testing a company is required to perform based on the company&#8217;s asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet ex posure. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve amended and simplified its capital planning rules and introduced the SCB to more closely align individual firm capital requirements to the firm&#8217;s risk profile. The SCB uses the results from the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress tests, which are one component of the CCAR, to help determine each firm's capital requirements for the coming year. On August 10, 2020 the Federal Reserve announced the individual large bank capital requirements. SHUSA&#8217;s CET1 SCB is 2.5% resulting in a 7% CET1 capital requirement under the revised rules. The simplified SCB rule was effective on October 1, 2020 but has been superseded, temporarily in the third and fourth quarter of 2020, by the Interim Policy which limits distributions as described above under &#8220;Payment of Dividends&#8221;. 

On October 7, 2020 the Federal Reserve proposed amendments to capital planning and stress testing requirements for large BHCs. Under the proposal, as a Category IV firm under the supervisory tailoring rule, SHUSA would be required to submit a capital plan on an annual basis but would generally no longer be required to utilize the scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve. The Company continues to evaluate planned capital actions in its annual capital plan and on an ongoing basis. 

Liquidity Rules 

The Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC have established a rule to implement the Basel III LCR for certain internationally active banks and nonbank financial companies, and a modified version of the LCR for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active. The LCR is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to its expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon. Smaller covered companies (more than $50 billion in assets) such as the Company were required to calculate the LCR monthly beginning January 2016. 

In October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized rules that tailor the liquidity requirements based on a company&#8217;s asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. In light of the fact that the Company is under $250 billion in assets and has less than $50 billion in short-term wholesale funding, the Company is no longer required to disclose the US LCR. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

In October 2020, the joint agencies published the final rule for the NSFR. The NSFR is designed to encourage more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. The metric requires large banking organizations to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to their on- and off-balance sheet activities, thereby reducing the likelihood that disruptions to a bank's regular sources of funding will erode its liquidity in a way that could increase the risk of its failure and potentially lead to broader systemic stress. Similar to the aforementioned criteria used to determine US LCR reporting requirements, the final NSFR rule would not be applicable to the Company based upon its size and risk profile. 

Resolution Planning 

The DFA requires the Company to prepare and regularly update resolution plans. The 165(d) resolution plan must assume that the covered company is resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and that no &#8220;extraordinary support&#8221; is received from the U.S. or any other government. The most recent 165(d) resolution plan was submitted to the Federal Reserve and FDIC in December 2018. In addition, under amended Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvements Act rules, the IDI resolution plan rule requires that a bank with assets of $50 billion or more develop a plan for its resolution that supports depositors&#8217; rapid access to their insured deposits, maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets, and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by creditors in resolution. The most recent IDI resolution plan was submitted to the FDIC in June 2018. 

TLAC 

The TLAC Rule requires certain U.S. organizations to maintain a minimum amount of loss-absorbing instruments, including a minimum amount of unsecured LTD. The TLAC Rule applies to U.S. GSIBs and to IHCs with $50 billion or more in U.S. non-branch assets that are controlled by a global systemically important FBO. The Company is such an IHC. 

Under the TLAC Rule, companies are required to maintain a minimum amount of TLAC, which consists of a minimum amount of LTD and Tier 1 capital. As a result, SHUSA must hold the higher of 18% of its RWAs or 9% of its total consolidated assets in the form of TLAC, of which 6% of its RWAs or 3.5% of total consolidated assets must consist of LTD. In addition, SHUSA must maintain a TLAC buffer composed solely of CET1 capital and will be subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments based on the size of the TLAC buffer it maintains. The TLAC Rule became effective on January 1, 2019. 

Volcker Rule 

The DFA added new Section 13 to the BHCA, which is commonly referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule.&#8221; The Volcker Rule prohibits a &#8220;banking entity&#8221; from engaging in &#8220;proprietary trading&#8221; or engaging in any of the following activities with respect to a Covered Fund: (i) acquiring or retaining any equity, partnership or other ownership interest in the Covered Fund; (ii) controlling the Covered Fund; or (iii) engaging in certain transactions with the fund if the banking entity or any affiliate is an investment adviser or sponsor to the Covered Fund. These prohibitions are subject to certain exemptions for permitted activities. 

Because the term &#8220;banking entity&#8221; includes an IDI, a depository institution holding company and any of their affiliates, the Volcker Rule has sweeping worldwide application and covers entities such as Santander, the Company, and certain of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries (including the Bank and SC), as well as other Santander subsidiaries in the United States and abroad. 

The Company implemented certain policies and procedures, training programs, recordkeeping, internal controls and other compliance requirements that were necessary to comply with the Volcker Rule. As required by the Volcker Rule, the compliance infrastructure has been tailored to each banking entity based on its size and its level of trading and Covered Fund activities. SHUSA's compliance program includes, among other things, processes for prior approval of new activities and investments permitted under the Volcker Rule, testing and auditing for compliance and a process for attesting annually that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule. 

In October 2019, the joint agencies responsible for administering the Volcker Rule finalized revisions to Volcker Rule. The final rule tailors the Volcker Rule&#8217;s compliance requirements to the amount of a firm&#8217;s trading activity, revise the definition of a trading account, clarify certain key provisions in the Volcker Rule, and simplify the information companies are required to provide the banking agencies. The Company is in the process of transitioning to the requirements of this revised rule. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

In July 2020, the joint agencies finalized a rule that revised the Volcker Rule further. The 2020 revisions provide an exemption for activities of qualifying foreign excluded funds, revise the exclusions from the definition of a &#8220;covered fund&#8221;, create new exclusions from the definition of a covered fund, and modify the definition of an ownership interest. The new rule became effective on October 1, 2020, and the Company is in the process of transitioning to the requirements of this revised rule. 

Risk Retention Rule 

In December 2014, the Federal Reserve issued its final credit risk retention rule, which generally requires sponsors of ABS to retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing ABS. SHUSA, primarily through SC, is an active participant in the structured finance markets and began to comply with the retention requirements effective in December 2016. 

Market Risk Rule 

The market risk rule requires certain national banks to measure and hold risk-based regulatory capital for the market risk of their covered positions. The bank must measure and hold capital for its market risk using its internal-risk based models. The market risk rule outlines quantitative requirements for the bank's internal risk based models, as well as qualitative requirements for the bank's management of market risk. Banks subject to the market risk rule must also measure and hold market risk regulatory capital for the specific risk associated with certain debt and equity positions. 

A bank is subject to the market risk capital rules if its consolidated trading activity, defined as the sum of trading assets and liabilities as reported in its FFIEC 031 and FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, equals the lesser of: (1) 10 percent or more of the bank's total assets as reported in its Call Report and FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, or (2) $1 billion or more. At September 30, 2019, SBNA reported aggregate trading exposure in excess of the market risk threshold and, as a result, both the Company and SBNA began holding the market risk component within RWAs of the risk-based capital ratios, and submitted the FFIEC 102 - Market Risk Regulatory Report beginning for the period ended December 31, 2019. The incorporation of market risk within regulatory capital has resulted in a decrease in the risk-based capital ratios. 

Capital Simplification Rule 

The federal banking agencies adopted a final rule that simplifies for non-advanced approaches banking organizations the generally applicable capital rules and makes a number of technical corrections. Specifically, it reverses the previous transition provision freeze on MSRs and deferred tax assets by modifying the risk-weight from 100% to 250%. The rule will also replace the existing methodology for calculating includible minority interest with a flat 10% limit at each capital level. The increased risk weighting presents an unfavorable decline to the Company's risk-based ratios, but Tier 1 and total capital ratios has improve overall due to the additional minority interest includible under the simplified rule. Adoption of the capital simplification rule was required by the regulatory agencies on April 1, 2020. 

Heightened Standards 

OCC guidelines to strengthen the governance and risk management practices of large financial institutions are commonly referred to as &#8220;heightened standards.&#8221; The heightened standards apply to insured national banks with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets. The heightened standards require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activities. The heightened standards also provide minimum standards for the institutions&#8217; boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

Depository institutions must remain in compliance with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve's Regulation W, which governs transactions of the Company's banking subsidiaries with affiliated companies and individuals. Section 23A imposes limits on certain specified &#8220;covered transactions,&#8221; which include loans, lines, and letters of credit to affiliated companies or individuals, and investments in affiliated companies, as well as certain other transactions with affiliated companies and individuals. . 

Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act prohibits a depository institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are considered arms'-length. As a U.S. domiciled subsidiary of a global parent with significant non-bank affiliates, the Company faces elevated compliance risk in this area. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Regulation AB II 

Regulation AB II, among other things, expanded disclosure requirements and modified the offering and shelf registration process for ABS. SC must comply with these rules, which impact all offerings of publicly registered ABS and all reports under the Exchange Act, for outstanding publicly-registered ABS, and affect SC's public securitization platform. 

CRA 

SBNA and BSPR are subject to the requirements of the CRA, which requires the appropriate federal financial supervisory agency to assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which it is located. BSPR&#8217;s current CRA rating is &#8220;Outstanding&#8221; and SBNA&#8217;s current CRA rating is "Satisfactory." The OCC takes into account the Bank&#8217;s CRA rating in considering certain regulatory applications the Bank makes, including applications related to establishing and relocating branches, and the Federal Reserve does the same with respect to certain regulatory applications the Company makes. 

On December 12, 2019, the OCC and the FDIC jointly issued the CRA NPR to modernize the regulatory framework implementing the CRA. On May 20, 2020, the OCC issued the CRA Final Rule implementing many of the provisions of the CRA NPR. The CRA NPR generally focuses on clarifying and expanding the activities that qualify for CRA consideration, allowing the OCC to evaluate a bank&#8217;s CRA performance through quantitative measures intended to assess the volume and value of activity, updating how assessment areas are determined to account for institutions such as internet-based banks that receive a substantial portion of their deposits outside physical branch locations, and increasing transparency and timeliness in reporting. In connection with promulgating the CRA Final Rule, the OCC issued a publicly available, non-exhaustive list of activities that would automatically receive CRA consideration. and a process for confirming that particular activities meet the qualifying activities criteria. In addition, the CRA Final Rule allows banks to receive consideration for certain qualifying activities conducted outside their assessment areas. While the CRA Final Rule took effect on October 1, 2020, SBNA will have until January 1, 2023 to bring its operations into compliance with the rule. Although SBNA will be required to comply with the CRA Final Rule in 2023, the OCC has deferred to a future rulemaking process how to calibrate the key thresholds and benchmarks used in the rule to determine the level of performance necessary to achieve a performance rating. 

Other Regulatory Matters 

On March 21, 2017, SC and the Company entered into a written agreement with the FRB of Boston. Under the terms of that agreement, SC is required to enhance its compliance risk management program, board oversight of risk management and senior management oversight of risk management, and the Company is required to enhance its oversight of SC's management and operations. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Disclosure Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act 

Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act of 1934, an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. 

The following activities are disclosed in response to Section 13(r) with respect to affiliates of SHUSA within Santander. During the period covered by this annual report: 

&#8226; Santander UK holds three blocked accounts for two customers, with the first customer holding one GBP savings account and one GBP current account, and the second customer holding one GBP savings account. Both of the customers, who are resident in the UK, are currently designated by the U.S. under the SDGT sanctions program with accounts blocked since designation. The accounts are dormant. Revenues and profits generated by Santander UK on these accounts in the first three quarters of 2020 were negligible relative to the overall profits of Santander. 

&#8226; Santander UK holds two frozen current accounts for two UK nationals who are designated by the U.S. under the SDGT sanctions program. The accounts held by one customer were fully inaccessible at the time of the US designation and were blocked at the time of the account going into a debit balance. The accounts held by the second customer were blocked immediately following the US designation and have been frozen throughout the first three quarters of 2020. These accounts are frozen in order to comply with Articles 2, 3 and 7 of Council Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 imposing certain specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities associated with the Al-Qaeda network, by virtue of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1815. The accounts are in arrears (&#163;1,844.73 in debit combined) and are currently being managed by Santander UK's Collections and Recoveries Department. No revenues or profits were generated by Santander UK on these accounts in the first three quarters of 2020. 

&#8226; Santander, also has certain legacy performance guarantees for the benefit of Bank Sepah and Bank Mellat (stand-by letters of credit to guarantee the obligations - either under tender documents or under contracting agreements - of contractors who participated in public bids in Iran) that were in place prior to April 27, 2007. 

In the aggregate, all of the transactions described above resulted in gross revenues and net profits in the first three quarters of 2020 which were negligible relative to the overall revenues and profits of Santander. S antander has undertaken significant steps to withdraw from the Iranian market, such as closing its representative office in Iran and ceasing all banking activities therein, including correspondent relationships, deposit-taking from Iranian entities and issuing export letters of credit, except for the legacy transactions described above. Santander is not contractually permitted to cancel these arrangements without either (i) paying the guaranteed amount (in the case of the performance guarantees), or (ii) forfeiting the outstanding amounts due to it (in the case of the export credits). As such, Santander intends to continue to provide the guarantees and hold these assets in accordance with company policy and applicable laws. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This MD&#38;A is based on the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The significant accounting policies of the Company are described in Note 1 of the Company's Annual Form 10-K as of December 31, 2019, and have been updated as appropriate in Note 1 of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, accordingly, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Our estimates include consideration of the current uncertainty in the economy and the results may be materially different. Management identified accounting for ACL, estimates of expected residual values of leased vehicles subject to operating leases, accretion of discounts and subvention on RICs, goodwill, fair value measurements and income taxes as the Company's most critical accounting estimates, in that they are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results and require management&#8217;s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. 

There have been material changes in the Company&#8217;s critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in Item 7 of the Company's 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These changes are a result of the Company's adoption of the CECL standard on January 1, 2020. Refer to Note 1, Note 4 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the section captioned "Credit Quality" of this MD&#38;A for detailed discussions around accounting policy, estimation process and assumptions used in determining the ACL.

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Net interest income increased $2.3 million and decreased $97.6 million for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the comparative periods in 2019. The most significant factors contributing to these changes are as follows: 

Interest Income on Investment Securities and Interest-Earning Deposits 

Interest income on investment securities and interest-earning deposits decreased $59.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019. The average balances of investment securities and interest-earning deposits for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 was $26.8 billion with an average yield of 1.12%, compared to an average balance of $22.2 billion with an average yield of 2.42% for the corresponding period in 2019. The decrease in interest income on investment securities and interest-earning deposits for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the average yield on interest-earning deposits resulting from the Federal Reserve response to the outbreak of COVID-19. 

Interest income on investment securities and interest-earning deposits decreased $121.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019. The average balances of investment securities and interest-earning deposits for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 was $26.9 billion with an average yield of 1.46%, compared to an average balance of $21.5 billion with an average yield of 2.59% for the corresponding period in 2019. The decrease in interest income on investment securities and interest-earning deposits for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the average yield on interest-earning deposits resulting from the Federal Reserve response to the outbreak of COVID-19. 

Interest Income on Loans 

Interest income on loans for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020, compared to 2019 reflected increases in the average balance for both periods, offset by decreasing rates, particularly during the first half of 2020. 

Interest Expense on Deposits and Related Customer Accounts 

Interest expense on deposits and related customer accounts decreased for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019. These decreases were a result of the near zero interest rate environment offset by builds in overall deposits. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Interest Expense on Borrowed Funds 

Interest expense on borrowed funds decreased $95.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was due to lower interest rates being paid, offset by increased balances during the quarter ended September 30, 2020. The average balance of total borrowings was $49.1 billion with an average cost of 2.59% for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, compared to an average balance of $48.4 billion with an average cost of 3.41% for 2019. The average balance of borrowed funds increased for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2019, primarily due to increases in FHLB advances, credit facilities and secured structured financings. 

Interest expense on borrowed funds decreased $157.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was due to lower interest rates being paid offset by increased balances during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020. The average balance of total borrowings was $50.7 billion with an average cost of 2.82% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, compared to an average balance of $46.5 billion with an average cost of 3.52% for 2019. The average balance of borrowed funds increased for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019, primarily due to increases in FHLB advances, credit facilities and secured structured financings. 

CREDIT LOSS EXPENSE 

Credit loss expense was $405.8 million and $2.6 billion for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $603.6 million and $1.7 billion, respectively, for the comparative periods in 2019. The increase year over year was primarily due to reserve build during the first and second quarters of 2020 associated with a weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. The decrease quarter over quarter was due to a decrease in net charge offs. 

Total charge-offs of $606.1 million and $2.8 billion for three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020, respectively, were lower by $818.5 million and $1.3 billion from the comparative periods in 2019 as a result of the Company's programs in response to COVID-19. Total recoveries during these periods also decreased.

Total non-interest income increased $173.7 million and $128.8 million for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020 compared to the corresponding periods in 2019. The increase for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020 was primarily related to an increase in miscellaneous income. The increase for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 was primarily due to an increase in lease income, partially offset by a decrease in consumer fees. 

Consumer fees 

Consumer fees decreased $40.9 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily related to a decrease in consumer deposit fees, related to more few waivers given in 2020 compared to 2019. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Commercial fees 

Commercial fees consists of deposit overdraft fees, deposit automated teller machine fees, cash management fees, letter of credit fees, and loan syndication fees for commercial accounts. Commercial fees remained relatively stable for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019. 

Lease income 

Lease income increased $153.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019. This increase was the result of the growth in the Company's lease portfolio, with an average balance of $16.4 billion for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, compared to $15.1 billion at September 30, 2019.

Miscellaneous income increased $178.2 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019. The increase is primarily related to an increase in gain on sale of operating leases, a decrease in loss on sale of non-mortgage loans, and a gain recognized on the sale of SBC. 

Miscellaneous income increased $2.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019. The increase is primarily related to the three-month period ended September 30, 2020 activity above, partially offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous income due to fair value adjustments related to the transfer of loan to HFS in the second quarter of 2020.

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Total general, administrative and other expenses decreased $64.0 million and increased $1.9 billion for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020, compared to the corresponding periods of 2019. The most significant factors contributing to the quarter-to-date changes were as follows: 

&#8226; Technology, outside services, and marketing expense decreased $53.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, compared to the corresponding period in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to reduced marketing and technology spending in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8226; Loan expense decreased $31.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, compared to the corresponding period in 2019. This decrease was primarily the result of lower repossession volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8226; Lease expense increased $88.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, compared to the corresponding period in 2019. This increase was primarily due to more depreciation on a larger lease portfolio and fewer liquidations. 

&#8226; Other expenses decreased $39.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, compared to the corresponding period in 2019. This decrease was the result of lower legal and operational risk expenses. 

In addition to the goodwill impairment charge discussed above, other significant factors for the year-to-date included: 

&#8226; Technology, outside services, and marketing expense decreased $96.0 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was driven by reductions in marketing and technology spending that have resulted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8226; Loan expense decreased $88.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019. This is primarily due to the lower repossession volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8226; Lease expense increased $327.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019. This increase was primarily due to more depreciation on a larger lease portfolio and less liquidations. 

&#8226; Other expenses decreased $108.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, compared to the corresponding period in 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in legal and operational risk expenses. Travel and entertainment expenses also saw a significant decrease as COVID-19 has limited corporate travel. 

INCOME TAX PROVISION 

An income tax benefit of $53.3 million and a provision of $112.9 million were recorded for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. An income tax benefit of $272.9 million and a provision of $384.5 million were recorded for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This resulted in an ETR of (6.5)% and 29.5% for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 19.3% and 29.6% for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

The Company's ETR in future periods will be affected by the results of operations allocated to the various tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates, any change in income tax laws or regulations within those jurisdictions, and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the Company's interpretations by tax authorities that examine tax returns filed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 

Refer to Note 14 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the year-to-year comparison of the ETR.

CBB reported a loss before income taxes of $5.3 million and $1.8 billion for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020, compared to income before income taxes of $49.3 million and $78.3 million for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019. Factors contributing to this change were: 

&#8226; Non-interest income decreased $46.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2019. This decrease was due to a one-time gain recorded on the sale of branches in 2019, and decreased fee income in 2020 resulting from lower transaction volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8226; Credit loss expense increased $287.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 compared to the corresponding period of 2019. This increase was due to large reserve builds in response to the economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 outbreak and the growing auto loan portfolio. 

&#8226; Total expenses increased $1.5 billion for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 compared to the corresponding period of 2019. This increase was due to the goodwill impairment that was recorded in the second quarter of 2020.

Factors contributing to these changes were: 

&#8226; Credit loss expense increased $73.0 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 compared to the corresponding period of 2019. This increase was due to large reserve builds in response to the economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 outbreak. 

&#8226; Total expenses increased $261.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 compared to the corresponding period of 2019. This increase was the result of the goodwill impairment recorded during the second quarter of 2020, offset by small reductions in travel and entertainment expenses, and marketing expenses related to the COVID-19 outbreak.

&#8226; Total non-interest income increased $52.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 compared to the corresponding period of 2019. This increase was due to the increase in fee income resulting from the large amounts of debt underwritten during the second quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 related economic uncertainty, and higher fixed income revenues. 

&#8226; Credit loss expense increased $24.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 compared to the corresponding period of 2019. This increase was due to large reserve builds in response to the economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 outbreak. 

&#8226; Total assets increased $1.9 billion, as a result of growth in the business and client growth at September 30, 2020 compared to 2019.

Commercial 

Commercial loans decreased approximately $1.4 billion, or 3.4%, from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020. This decrease was comprised of decreases in CRE loans of $1.0 billion C&#38;I loans of $245.0 million. This decrease is reflective of the sale of SBC, largely in the CRE and C&#38;I portfolios, offset by originations of C&#38;I loans, including PPP loans.

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Consumer Loans Secured By Real Estate 

Consumer loans secured by real estate decreased $2.2 billion, or 16.1%, from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020. This decrease was comprised of decreases in the residential mortgage portfolio of $1.7 billion, which is partially attributable to the sale of SBC, and decreases in the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio of $481.8 million. 

Consumer Loans Not Secured By Real Estate 

RICs and auto loans 

RICs and auto loans increased $4.2 billion, or 11.4%, from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020. The increase in the RIC and auto loan portfolio was primarily due to an increase in originations, net of securitizations. RICs are collateralized by vehicle titles, and the lender has the right to repossess the vehicle in the event the consumer defaults on the payment terms of the contract. Most of the Company's RICs HFI are pledged against warehouse lines or securitization bonds. Refer to further discussion of these in Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

As of September 30, 2020, 62.9% of the Company's RIC and auto loan portfolio balance was comprised of nonprime loans (defined by the Company as customers with a FICO score of below 640) with customers who did not qualify for conventional consumer finance products as a result of, among other things, a lack of or adverse credit history, low income levels and/or the inability to provide adequate down paym ents. This also includes 10.7% of loans for which no FICO score is available or legacy portfolios for which FICO is not considered in the ALLL model. While underwriting guidelines are designed to establish that the customer would be a reasonable credit risk, nonprime loans will nonetheless experience higher default rates than a portfolio of obligations of prime customers. Additionally, higher unemployment rates, higher gasoline prices, unstable real estate values, re-sets of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates, the general availability of consumer credit, and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could lead to an increase in delinquencies, defaults, and repossessions, as well as decreased consumer demand for used automobiles and other consumer products, weaken collateral values and increase losses in the event of default. Because SC's historical focus for such credit has been predominantly on nonprime consumers, the actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses on these loans could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn. 

The Company's automated originations process for these credits reflects a disciplined approach to credit risk management to mitigate the risks of nonprime customers. The Company's robust historical data on both organically originated and acquired loans provides it with the ability to perform advanced loss forecasting. Each applicant is automatically assigned a proprietary custom score using information such as FICO scores, DTI ratios, LTV ratios, and over 30 other predictive factors, placing the applicant in one of 100 pricing tiers. The pricing in each tier is continuously monitored and adjusted to reflect market and risk trends. In addition to the Company's automated process, it maintains a team of underwriters for manual review, consideration of exceptions, and review of deal structures with dealers. 

At September 30, 2020, a typical RIC was originated with an average annual percentage rate of 13.8% and was purchased from the dealer at a premium of 1.0%. All of the Company's RICs and auto loans are fixed-rate loans. 

The Company records an ALLL to cover its estimate of inherent losses on its RICs incurred as of the balance sheet date. 

Personal unsecured and other consumer loans 

Personal unsecured and other consumer loans decreased from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020 by $518.8 million. 

As a result of the strategic evaluation of SC's personal lending portfolio, in the third quarter of 2015, SC began reviewing strategic alternatives for exiting its personal loan portfolios. SC's other significant personal lending relationship is with Bluestem. SC continues to perform in accordance with the terms and operative provisions of the agreements under which it is obligated to purchase personal revolving loans originated by Bluestem for a term ending in 2020, or 2022 if extended at Bluestem's option. The Bluestem loan portfolio is carried as held-for-sale in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, the Company has recorded lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments on this portfolio, and there may be further such adju stments required in future period financial statements. Management is currently evaluating alternatives for the Bluestem portfolio. As of September 30, 2020, SC's personal unsecured portfolio was held-for-sale and thus does not have a related allowance.

(1) Annualized net loan charge-offs are based on year-to-date charge-offs. 

The increase in the ALLL as a percentage of total NPLs is a result of the adoption of the CECL standard effective January 1, 2020. 

Potential problem loans are loans not currently classified as NPLs for which management has doubts about the borrowers&#8217; ability to comply with the present repayment terms. These assets are principally loans delinquent for more than 30 days but less than 90 days. Potential problem commercial loans totaled approximately $262.7 million and $179.9 million at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. This increase was primarily due to one large borrower within the Other Commercial portfolio. 

Potential problem consumer loans amounted to $2.7 billion and $4.7 billion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Management has included these loans in its evaluation of the Company's ACL and reserved for them during the respective periods. 

Non-performing assets decreased to $1.8 billion, or 1.2% of total assets, at September 30, 2020, compared to $2.5 billion, or 1.6% of total assets, at December 31, 2019, due to lower NPLs resulting from COVID-19 deferral program. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Commercial 

Commercial NPLs decreased $7.4 million from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020. Commercial NPLs accounted for 0.7% of commercial LHFI at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The decrease in commercial NPLs was primarily comprised of decreases of $51.2 million in C&#38;I offset by increases of $46.2 million in the Multifamily portfolio. 

Consumer Loans Not Secured by Real Estate 

RICs and amortizing personal loans are classified as non-performing when they are more than 60 DPD (i.e., 61 or more DPD) with respect to principal or interest. Except for loans accounted for using the FVO, at the time a loan is placed on non-performing status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income. When an account is 60 days or less past due, it is returned to performing status and the Company returns to accruing interest on the loan. The accrual of interest on revolving personal loans continues until the loan is charged off. 

RIC TDRs are placed on non-accrual status when the account becomes past due more than 60 days. For loans in non-accrual status, interest income is recognized on a cash basis. For loans on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest is resumed if a delinquent account subsequently becomes 60 days or less past due. NPLs in the RIC and auto loan portfolio decreased by $676.4 million from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020. Non-performing RICs and auto loans accounted for 2.4% and 4.5% of total RICs and auto loans at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

Consumer Loans Secured by Real Estate 

The following table shows NPLs compared to total loans outstanding for the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively: 

September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands) Residential mortgages Home equity loans and lines of credit Residential mortgages Home equity loans and lines of credit NPLs - HFI $ 164,001 &#160; $ 94,872 &#160; $ 134,957 $ 107,289 Total LHFI 7,132,279 &#160; 4,288,526 &#160; 8,835,702 4,770,344 NPLs as a percentage of total LHFI 2.3 &#160; % 2.2 &#160; % 1.5 % 2.2 % 

The NPL ratio is usually higher for the Company's residential mortgage loan portfolio compared to the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio due to a number of factors, including the prolonged workout and foreclosure resolution processes for residential mortgage loans, differences in risk profiles, and mortgage loans located outside the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States. Foreclosures on consumer loans secured by real estate were $258.9 million or 32.0% of non-performing consumer loans secured by real estate at September 30, 2020, compared to $242.2 million and 45.9% of consumer loans secured by real estate at December 31, 2019. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Delinquencies 

The Company generally considers an account delinquent when an obligor fails to pay substantially all (defined as 90%) of the scheduled payment by the due date. 

Overall, total delinquencies decreased by $2.2 billion, or 38.5%, from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020, most significantly within the RICs and auto loan portfolio, which decreased $2.1 billion. Delinquent balances and nonaccrual balances overall were lower as of September 30, 2020 primarily due to the large number of deferrals granted to borrowers impacted by COVID-19. 

TDRs 

TDRs are loans that have been modified as the Company has agreed to make certain concessions to both meet the needs of customers and maximize its ultimate recovery on the loans. TDRs occur when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the loan is modified with terms that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower. The types of concessions granted are generally interest rate reductions, limitations on accrued interest charged, term extensions, and deferments of principal. 

TDRs are generally placed on nonaccrual status upon modification, unless the loan was performing immediately prior to modification. For most portfolios, TDRs may return to accrual status after a sustained period of repayment performance, as long as the Company believes the principal and interest of the restructured loan will be paid in full. RIC TDRs are placed on nonaccrual status when the Company believes repayment under the revised terms is not reasonably assured and, at the latest, when the account becomes more than 60 DPD. RIC TDRs are considered for return to accrual when the account becomes 60 days or less past due. To the extent the TDR is determined to be collateral-dependent and the source of repayment depends on the operation of the collateral, the loan may be returned to accrual status based on the foregoing parameters. To the extent the TDR is determined to be collateral-dependent and the source of repayment depends on disposal of the collateral, the loan may not be returned to accrual status. 

The following table summarizes TDRs at the dates indicated:

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following table provides a summary of TDR activity:

(1) New TDRs includes drawdowns on lines of credit that have previously been classified as TDRs. 

The decrease in total delinquent TDRs is primarily due to the significant increase in deferrals provided to borrowers in response to COVID-19 impacts. 

In accordance with the Company&#8217;s policies and guidelines, the Company may offer extensions (deferrals) to consumers on its RICs, whereby the consumer is allowed to move a maximum of three payments per event to the end of the loan. The Company&#8217;s policies and guidelines limit the frequency of each new deferral that may be granted to one deferral every six months, regardless of the length of any prior deferral. The maximum number of lifetime months extended for all automobile RICs was eight, while some marine and RV contracts had a maximum of twelve months extended to reflect their longer term. Additionally, the Company generally limits the granting of deferrals on new accounts until a requisite number of payments has been received. However, many of these practices have been temporarily revised to accommodate borrowers impacted by COVID-19, including increasing the maximum number of extensions, allowing more than one deferral every six months and removing the requirement that a requisite number of months have passed since origination. During the deferral period, the Company continues to accrue and collect interest on the loan in accordance with the terms of the deferral agreement. 

At the time a deferral is granted, all delinquent amounts may be deferred or paid. This may result in the classification of the loan as current and therefore not considered a delinquent account. However, there are other instances when a deferral is granted but the loan is not brought completely current, such as when the account days past due is greater than the deferment period granted. Such accounts are aged based on the timely payment of future installments in the same manner as any other account. Historically, the majority of deferrals on RICs are approved for borrowers who are either 31-60 or 61-90 DPD and these borrowers are typically reported as current after deferral. For the RIC portfolio, if a customer receives two or more deferrals over the life of the loan, the loan would generally advance to a TDR designation. 

However in March 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an &#8220;Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus.&#8221; This guidance encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers that may be unable to meet their contractual obligations because of the effects of COVID-19 and concludes that short-term modifications (e.g., six months) made on a good faith basis to borrowers who were impacted by COVID-19 and who were less than 30 days past due as of the implementation date of a relief program are not TDRs. Additionally, Section 4013 of the CARES Act grants companies the option of not applying the GAAP TDR guidance to certain loans with COVID-19 modifications. 

In March 2020, the Company began actively working with its borrowers impacted by COVID-19 and provided loan modification programs to mitigate the adverse effects of COVID-19. In both its consumer and commercial portfolios, the programs generally include payment deferrals for a period of one to six months. In the Company's RIC and auto loan portfolio, the predominant program offering is a deferral of payments to the end of the loan term and waiver of late charges of up to three months. For credit cards, we offer a temporary payment reduction program for a period of up to three months. Payment deferrals on mortgages can be for up to one year. The Company does not consider payment deferrals of up to six months to customers who were current prior to implementation of the Company's relief programs to be TDRs, in accordance with its accounting policy and interagency regulatory guidelin es. Additionally, the Company applies the TDR provisions of the CARES Act to certain consumer loans that received COVID19 modifications, if they were current as of December 31, 2019. Consumer loans that are granted deferrals beyond 180 days are not classified as TDRs if they comply with the requirements of the CARES Act. 

Since the implementation of the programs in March 2020, we experienced a sharp increase in requests for relief related to COVID-19 nationwide and a significant number of such extensions have been granted. Through September 30, 2020 the Bank had granted extensions to approximately 43,000 unique customer accounts totaling approximately $7.0 billion in connection with COVID-19. Additionally, SC has granted over 911,000 loan extensions to 645,000 unique customer accounts totaling approximately $11 billion of loans that have been granted a COVID-19 deferral. 

The following table provides a summary of SBNA and SC loan balances with active payment deferrals due to COVID-19 as of the end of each reporting period: 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

September 30, 2020 June 30, 2020 Loan balance of active extensions (1) 

% of Portfolio Loan balance of active extensions (1) 

% of Portfolio Santander Bank Commercial $949,619 2.7% $4,274,150 12.0% Consumer (including SBNA RICs) 441,266 2.2% 1,367,414 6.6% Total SBNA $1,390,885 2.5% $5,641,564 11.2% Santander Consumer RICs $959,236 2.9% $3,753,717 12.3% 

(1) Santander Consumer balances exclude deferrals with payments due in the current month. 

As of September 30, 2020, approximately 11% of SBNA customer accounts that received extensions were active, 82% had exited deferral, and 7% had paid down or charged off. Of the loans that have exited deferral status, 98% of the loan balances are less than 30 days past due. 

As of September 30, 2020, approximately 33% of SC's unique customer accounts have required COVID-19 assistance. Of these accounts, 86% have exited deferral status, 7% remain in active deferral, 5% have paid-off, and 2% have charged off. Of the loans that have exited deferral status, 85% are less than 30 days past due and 96% of these accounts have made at least one payment since their first COVID-19 extension. 

The Company evaluates the results of its deferral strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred compared to the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time. Based on this evaluation, the Company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio. 

Changes in deferral levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of consumer finance receivables charged-off. However, the timing of a charge-off may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge-off. To the extent deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged-off, historical charge-off ratios, loss confirmation periods, and cash flow forecasts used in the determination of the adequacy of the ALLL for loans classified as TDRs are also impacted. Increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the ALLL and related credit loss expense. Changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of the ALLL and related credit loss expense. For loans that are classified as TDRs, the Company generally compares the present value of expected cash flows to the outstanding recorded investment of TDRs to determine the amount of allowance and related credit loss expense that should be recorded. For loans that are considered collateral-dependent, such as certain bankruptcy modifications, impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral, less its estimated costs to sell. 

CREDIT RISK 

The risk inherent in the Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolios is driven by credit and collateral quality, and is affected by borrower-specific and economy-wide facts such as changes in employment, GDP, HPI, CRE price index, used car prices, and other factors. In general, there is an inverse relationship between credit quality of transactions and projections of impairment losses so that transactions with better credit quality require a lower expected loss. The Company manages this risk through its underwriting, pricing and credit approval guidelines and servicing policies and practices, as well as geographic and other concentration limits. 

The Company's ACL is principally based on various models subject to the Company's Model Risk Management Framework. New models are approved by the Company's Model Risk Management Committee. Models, inputs and documentation are further reviewed and validated at least annually, and the Company completes a detailed variance analysis of historical model projections against actual observed results on a quarterly basis. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its ACL Committee. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Management uses the qualitative framework to exercise judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and that are not considered by the quantitative framework. These adjustments are documented and reviewed through the Company&#8217;s risk management processes. Furthermore, management reviews, updates, and validates its process and loss assumptions on a periodic basis. This process involves an analysis of data integrity, review of loss and credit trends, a retrospective evaluation of actual loss information to loss forecasts, and other analyses. 

ACL levels are collectively reviewed for adequacy and approved quarterly. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its ACL Committee. The ACL levels are approved by the Board-level committees quarterly. 

ACL 

Changes to the ACL are discussed in Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments 

The reserve for unfunded lending commitments increased from $91.8 million at December 31, 2019 to $148.0 million at September 30, 2020. The increase of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments included an increase from the adoption of the CECL standard of $10.4 million while the remainder was primarily related to changes in the business environment resulting from COVID-19. The net impact of business as usual change in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments to the overall ACL was immaterial. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

INVESTMENT SECURITIES 

Investment securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasuries, MBS, ABS and FHLB and FRB stock. MBS consist of pass-through, CMOs and adjustable rate mortgages issued by federal agencies. The Company&#8217;s MBS are either guaranteed as to principal and interest by the issuer or have ratings of &#8220;AAA&#8221; by S&#38;P and Moody&#8217;s at the date of issuance. The Company&#8217;s AFS investment strategy is to purchase liquid fixed-rate and floating-rate investments to manage the Company's liquidity position and interest rate risk adequately. 

Total investment securities AFS decreased $3.3 billion to $11.1 billion at September 30, 2020, compared to $14.3 billion at December 31, 2019. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, the composition of the Company's investment portfolio changed due to a decrease in U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset with an increase in MBS. U.S. Treasuries decreased by $3.9 billion primarily due to investment sales and maturities. MBS increased by $608.6 million primarily due to investment purchases and an increase in unrealized gains, partially offset by investment sales, maturities and principal paydowns. For additional information with respect to the Company&#8217;s investment securities, see Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Debt securities for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity are classified as HTM securities. HTM securities are reported at cost and adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount. Total investment securities HTM were $5.5 billion at September 30, 2020. The Company had 125 investment securities classified as HTM as of September 30, 2020. 

Total gross unrealized gain/(loss) position on investment securities AFS increased by $199.3 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily related to an increase in unrealized gains of $200.4 million on MBS, primarily due to a decrease in interest rates. 

The average life of the AFS investment portfolio (excluding certain ABS) at September 30, 2020 was approximately 4.14 years. The average effective duration of the investment portfolio (excluding certain ABS) at September 30, 2020 was approximately 2.60 years. The actual maturities of MBS AFS will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

GOODWILL 

The Company records the excess of the cost of acquired entities over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired less the fair value of liabilities assumed as goodwill. Consistent with ASC 350, the Company does not amortize goodwill, and reviews the goodwill recorded for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the potential for goodwill impairment. At September 30, 2020, goodwill totaled $2.6 billion and represented 1.8% of total assets and 12.5% of total stockholder's equity. The following table shows goodwill by reporting units at September 30, 2020:

The Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment tests as of October 1, 2019 using generally accepted valuation methods. 

The Company completes a quarterly review for impairment indicators over each of its reporting units, which includes consideration of economic and organizational factors that could impact the fair value of the Company&#8217;s reporting units. As disclosed in footnote 5 to these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company determined that goodwill triggering events occurred in the CBB, C&#38;I and CRE &#38; VF reporting units during the second quarter of 2020. 

For the CBB reporting unit&#8217;s second quarter valuation analysis, a weighting of 25% to the market approach and 75% to the income approach was applied. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate of 10.0%, which represents management&#8217;s best estimate of the rate of return expected by market participants and aligns with the reporting unit's cost of equity at the time of the analysis. The Company increased a component of the discount rate to reflect the risk and uncertainty related to the reporting unit&#8217;s projected cash flows, which were adjusted downward from the Company&#8217;s year-end financial plan as a result of the estimated economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A long-term growth rate of 2.50 %, down from 3.0% at March 31, 2020, was applied in determining the terminal value. For the market approach, the Company selected a 30% control premium based on the Company&#8217;s review of transactions observable in the marketplace that were determined to be comparable. The equity value as a multiple of tangible book value of 0.9x was selected based on publicly traded peers of the reporting unit. The results of the fair value analysis did not exceed the carrying value for the CBB reporting unit, indicating that the reporting unit was considered to be impaired at June 30, 2020. As a result, the Company recorded a $1.6 billion impairment charge relate to the CBB reporting unit. 

For the C&#38;I reporting unit&#8217;s second quarter valuation analysis, a weighting of 25% to the market approach and 75% to the income approach was applied. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate of 11.4%, which represents management&#8217;s best estimate of the rate of return expected by market participants and aligns with the reporting unit's cost of equity at the time of the analysis. The Company increased a component of the discount rate to reflect the risk and uncertainty related to the reporting unit&#8217;s projected cash flows, which were adjusted downward from the Company&#8217;s year-end financial plan as a result of the estimated economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A long-term growth rate of 2.50%, down from 4.0% at October 1, 2019, was applied in determining the terminal value. For the market approach, the Company selected a 30% control premium based on the Company&#8217;s review of transactions observable in the marketplace that were determined to be comparable. The equity value as a multiple of tangible book value of 0.8x was selected based on publicly traded peers of the reporting unit. The results of the fair value analysis did not exceed the carrying value for the C&#38;I reporting unit indicating that the reporting unit was considered to be impaired at June 30, 2020. As a result, the Company recorded a $0.3 billion impairment charge relate to the C&#38;I reporting unit. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

For the CRE &#38; VF reporting unit&#8217;s second quarter valuation analysis, a weighting of 25% to the market approach and 75% to the income approach was applied. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate of 11.6%, which represents management&#8217;s best estimate of the rate of return expected by market participants and aligns with the reporting unit's cost of equity at the time of the analysis. The Company increased a component of the discount rate to reflect the risk and uncertainty related to the reporting unit&#8217;s projected cash flows, which were adjusted downward from the Company&#8217;s year-end financial plan as a result of the estimated economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A long-term growth rate of 2.50%, down from 3.0% at October 1, 2019, was applied in determining the terminal value. For the market approach, the Company selected a 30% control premium based on the Company&#8217;s review of transactions observable in the marketplace that were determined to be comparable. The equity value as a multiple of tangible book value of 1.2x was selected based on publicly traded peers of the reporting unit. The results of the fair value analysis exceeded the carrying value for the CRE &#38; VF reporting unit by less than 5%, indicating that the reporting unit was not considered to be impaired at June 30, 2020. 

The Company is in the process of completing its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2020. In addition to completing this analysis in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company will continue monitoring changes to all reporting units for potential indicators. There is an increased risk that further impairment or impairment within additional reporting units, up to the amount of remaining goodwill, could be recognized based on continued or additional declines in the market in future periods. 

DEFERRED TAXES AND OTHER TAX ACTIVITY 

The Company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $69.2 million at September 30, 2020, compared to a net deferred tax liability balance of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2019 (consisting of a deferred tax asset balance of $503.7 million and a deferred tax liability balance of $1.5 billion). During the quarter, the Company&#8217;s ownership of SC reached the 80% threshold which requires SC to file a consolidated federal tax return with the Company. As a result, SHUSA reversed its deferred tax liability of $306.6 million for the book over tax basis difference in its investment in SC. The $948.2 million decrease in net deferred liability for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 was primarily due to the adoption of the CECL standard during the first quarter of 2020 and the reversal of the deferred tax liability for the book over tax basis difference associated with the Company&#8217;s investment in SC during the third quarter of 2020. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

See further discussion of the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements in Note 7 and Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this MD&#38;A. 

For a discussion of the status of litigation with which the Company is involved with the IRS, please refer to Note 14 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

BANK REGULATORY CAPITAL 

The Company's capital priorities are to support client growth and business investment while maintaining appropriate capital in light of economic uncertainty and the Basel III framework. 

The Company is subject to the regulations of certain federal, state, and foreign agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, based on the Bank&#8217;s capital calculations, the Bank was considered well-capitalized under the applicable capital framework. In addition, the Company's capital levels as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, based on the Company&#8217;s capita l calculations, exceeded the required capital ratios for BHCs. 

For a discussion of Basel III, which became effective for SHUSA and the Bank on January 1, 2015, including the standardized approach and related future changes to the minimum U.S. regulatory capital ratios, see the section captioned "Regulatory Matters" in this MD&#38;A. 

Federal banking laws, regulations and policies also limit the Bank's ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to the Company. The Bank must obtain prior OCC approval to declare a dividend or make any other capital distribution if, after such dividend or distribution: (1) the Bank's total distributions to SHUSA within that calendar year would exceed 100% of its net income during the year plus retained net income for the prior two years, (2) the Bank would not meet capital levels imposed by the OCC in connection with any order, or (3) the Bank is not adequately capitalized at the time. The OCC's prior approval would also be required if the Bank were notified by the OCC that it is a problem institution or in troubled condition. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Any dividend declared and paid or return of capital has the effect of reducing capital ratios. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company paid cash dividends of $125.0 million, and $150.0 million, respectively, to its common stock shareholder. 

The following schedule summarizes the actual capital balances of SHUSA and the Bank at September 30, 2020: 

SHUSA September 30, 2020 Well-capitalized Requirement (1)

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Overall 

The Company continues to maintain strong liquidity. Liquidity represents the ability of the Company to obtain cost-effective funding to meet the needs of customers as well as the Company's financial obligations. Factors that impact the liquidity position of the Company include loan origination volumes, loan prepayment rates, the maturity structure of existing loans, core deposit growth levels, CD maturity structure and retention, the Company's credit ratings, investment portfolio cash flows, the maturity structure of the Company's wholesale funding, and other factors. These risks are monitored and managed centrally. The Company's Asset/Liability Committee reviews and approves the Company's liquidity policy and guidelines on a regular basis. This process includes reviewing all available wholesale liquidity sources. The Company also forecasts future liquidity needs and develops strategies to ensure adequate liquidity is available at all times. SHUSA conducts monthly liquidity stress test analyses to manage its liquidity under a variety of scenarios, all of which demonstrate that the Company has ample liquidity to meet its short-term and long-term cash requirements. 

Further changes to the credit ratings of SHUSA, Santander and its affiliates or the Kingdom of Spain could have a material adverse effect on SHUSA's business, including its liquidity and capital resources. The credit ratings of SHUSA have changed in the past and may change in the future, which could impact its cost of and access to sources of financing and liquidity. Any reductions in the long-term or short-term credit ratings of SHUSA would increase its borrowing costs and require it to replace funding lost due to the downgrade, which may include the loss of customer deposits, limit its access to capital and money markets and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivatives contracts and other secured funding arrangements. See further discussion on the impacts of credit ratings actions in the "Economic and Business Environment" section of this MD&#38;A. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Sources of Liquidity 

Company and Bank 

The Company and the Bank have several sources of funding to meet liquidity requirements, including the Bank's core deposit base, liquid investment securities portfolio, ability to acquire large deposits, FHLB borrowings, wholesale deposit purchases, and federal funds purchased, as well as through securitizations in the ABS market and committed credit lines from third-party banks and Santander. In addition, the Company has other sources of funding to meet its liquidity requirements such as dividends and returns of investments from its subsidiaries, short-term investments held by non-bank affiliates, and access to the capital markets. 

SC 

SC requires a significant amount of liquidity to originate and acquire loans and leases and to service debt. SC funds its operations through its lending relationships with 13 third-party banks, Santander and SHUSA, and through securitizations in the ABS market and flow agreements. SC seeks to issue debt that appropriately matches the cash flows of the assets that it originates. SC has more than $5.0 billion of stockholders&#8217; equity that supports its access to the securitization markets, credit facilities, and flow agreements. 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2020, SC completed on-balance sheet funding transactions totaling approximately $4.4 billion, including: 

&#8226; private amortizing lease facilities for approximately $1.2 billion; and 

&#8226; securitizations on its SDART platform for approximately $3.3 billion. 

SC also completed approximately $0.6 billion in asset sales to third parties during the quarter. 

For information regarding SC's debt, see Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

IHC 

On June 6, 2017, SIS entered into a revolving subordinated loan agreement with SHUSA not to exceed $290.0 million for a two-year term to mature in 2019. On October 16, 2018, the revolving loan agreement was increased to $895.0 million. 

As needed, SIS will draw down from another subordinated loan with Santander in order to enable SIS to underwrite certain large transactions in excess of the subordinated loan described above. At September 30, 2020, there was no outstanding balance on the subordinated loan. 

BSI's primary sources of liquidity are from customer deposits and deposits from affiliated banks. 

Institutional borrowings 

The Company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress scenarios, and maintains contingency plans consistent with the Company&#8217;s access to diversified sources of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources. These include cash, unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow at the FHLB and the FRB&#8217;s discount window. 

Available Liquidity 

As of September 30, 2020, the Bank had approximately $19.3 billion in committed liquidity from the FHLB and the FRB. Of this amount, $16.0 billion was unused and therefore provides additional borrowing capacity and liquidity for the Company. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents and LHFS) and securities AFS exclusive of securities pledged as collateral) totaled approximately $19.4 billion and $15.0 billion, respectively. These amounts represented 28.6% and 24.3% of total deposits at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of September 30, 2020, the Bank and BSI had $1.1 billion and $980.3 million, respectively, in cash held at the FRB. Management believes that the Company has ample liquidity to fund its operations.

Cash flows from financing activities 

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, net cash flow from financing activities was $(1.6) billion, which was primarily due to a decrease in net borrowing activity of $2.5 billion, $125.0 million in dividends paid on common stock, and $770.5 million in stock repurchases attributable to NCI, partially offset by a $1.9 billion increase in deposits. 

Net cash flow from financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019 was $9.0 billion, which was primarily due to an increase in net borrowing activity of $4.2 billion and a $5.2 billion increase in deposits, partially offset by $150.0 million in dividends paid on common stock and $245.7 million in stock repurchases attributable to NCI. 

See the SCF for further details on the Company's sources and uses of cash. 

Credit Facilities 

Third-Party Revolving Credit Facilities 

Warehouse Lines 

SC has one credit facility with eight banks providing an aggregate commitment of $3.5 billion for the exclusive use of providing short-term liquidity needs to support Chrysler Capital lease financing. As of September 30, 2020, there was an outstanding balance of approximately $1.2 billion on this facility in the aggregate. The facility requires reduced advance rates in the event of delinquency, credit loss, or residual loss ratios, as well as other metrics exceeding specified thresholds. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

SC has eight credit facilities with eleven banks providing an aggregate commitment of $8.3 billion for the exclusive use of providing short-term liquidity needs to support core and Chrysler Capital loan financing. As of September 30, 2020, there was an outstanding balance of approximately $1.3 billion on these facilities in the aggregate. These facilities reduced advance rates in the event of delinquency, credit loss, as well as various other metrics exceeding specific thresholds. 

Repurchase Agreements 

SC also obtains financing through investment management or repurchase agreements under which it pledges retained subordinate bonds on its own securitizations as collateral for repurchase agreements with various borrowers and at renewable terms ranging up to 365 days. As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were outstanding balances of $311.9 million and $422.3 million, respectively, under these repurchase agreements. 

SHUSA and Santander Lending to SC 

The Company provides SC with $3.0 billion of committed revolving credit that can be drawn on an unsecured basis. The Company also provides SC with $7.2 billion of term financing with maturities ranging from October 2020 to June 2025. These loans eliminate in the consolidation of SHUSA. Santander provides SC with $4.0 billion of unsecured financing with maturities ranging from June 2022 and September 2022. 

Secured Structured Financings 

SC's secured structured financings primarily consist of both public, SEC-registered securitizations, as well as private securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, and privately issues amortizing notes. SC has on-balance sheet securitizations outstanding in the market with a cumulative ABS balance of approximately $27.0 billion. 

Flow Agreements 

In addition to SC's credit facilities and secured structured financings, SC has a flow agreement in place with a third party for charged-off assets. Loans and leases sold under these flow agreements are not on SC's balance sheet, but provide a stable stream of servicing fee income and may also provide a gain or loss on sale. SC continues to actively seek additional flow agreements. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing 

Beginning in 2017, SC had the option to sell a contractually determined amount of eligible prime loans to Santander through securitization platforms. As all of the notes and residual interests in the securitizations are acquired by Santander, SC recorded these transactions as true sales of the RICs securitized, and removed the sold assets from its consolidated balance sheets. Beginning in 2018, this program was replaced with a new program with SBNA, whereby SC has agreed to provide SBNA with origination support services in connection with the processing, underwriting, and purchasing of retail loans, primarily from FCA dealers, all of which are serviced by SC. 

SC also continues to periodically execute securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. After retaining the required credit risk retention via a 5% vertical interest, SC transfers all remaining notes and residual interests in these securitizations to third parties. SC subsequently records these transactions as true sales of the RICs securitized, and removes the sold assets from its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Uses of Liquidity 

The Company uses liquidity for debt service and repayment of borrowings, as well as for funding loan commitments and satisfying deposit withdrawal requests. SIS uses liquidity primarily to support underwriting transactions.The primary use of liquidity for BSI is to meet customer liquidity requirements, such as maturing deposits, investment activities, funds transfers, and payment of operating expenses. 

At September 30, 2020, the Company's liquidity to meet debt payments, debt service and debt maturities was in excess of 12 months. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Dividends, Contributions and Stock Issuances 

As of September 30, 2020, the Company had 530,391,043 shares of common stock outstanding. During the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020, the Company paid dividends of zero and $125.0 million, respectively, to its sole shareholder, Santander. 

SC paid a dividend of $0.22 per share in February 2020, May 2020, and August 2020. SC has paid a total of $212.6 million in dividends through September 30, 2020, of which $50.5 million has been paid to NCI and $162.1 million has been paid to the Company, which eliminates in the consolidated results of the Company. 

On September 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve extended the Interim Policy. Based on the Company's expected average trailing four quarters of net income, SC is prohibited from paying a dividend in the fourth quarter of 2020. Although SC&#8217;s standalone income is sufficient to declare and a pay a dividend, SC is consolidated into the Company's capital plan and therefore is subject to the Interim Policy which utilizes the Company&#8217;s average trailing income to determine the cap on common stock dividends. SC does not currently expect to declare or pay a dividend in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2020, SC purchased shares of SC Common Stock through a tender offer. 

On August 10, 2020, SC announced that it had substantially exhausted the amount of shares SC was permitted to repurchase under the exception to the Interim Policy the Federal Reserve granted SHUSA and that SC expected to repurchase an immaterial number of shares remaining under the exception approval. 

Below are the details of SC's tender offer and other share repurchase programs for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019:

The Company is a party to financial instruments and other arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. See further discussion on these risks in Note 11 and Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT 

Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Company&#8217;s traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in market interest rates, and consumer preferences, affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Interest rate risk is managed by the Company's Treasury group and measured by its Market Risk Department, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Committee. In managing interest rate risk, the Company seeks to minimize the variability of net interest income across various likely scenarios, while at the same time maximizing net interest income and the net interest margin. To achieve these objectives, the Treasury group works closely with each business line in the Company. The Treasury group also uses various other tools to manage interest rate risk, including wholesale funding maturity targeting, investment portfolio purchase strategies, asset securitizations/sales, and financial derivatives. 

Interest rate risk focuses on managing four elements of risk associated with interest rates: basis risk, repricing risk, yield curve risk and option risk. Basis risk stems from rate index timing differences with rate changes, such as differences in the extent of changes in Federal funds rates compared with the three-month LIBOR. Repricing risk stems from the different timing of contractual repricing, such as one-month versus three-month reset dates, as well as the related maturities. Yield curve risk stems from the impact on earnings and market value resulting from different shapes and levels of yield curves. Option risk stems from prepayment or early withdrawal risk embedded in various products. These four elements of risk are analyzed through a combination of net interest income and balance sheet valuation simulations, shocks to those simulations, and scenario and market value analyses, and the subsequent results are reviewed by management. Numerous assumptions are made to produce these analyses, including assumptions about new business volumes, loan and investment prepayment rates, deposit flows, interest rate curves, economic conditions and competitor pricing.

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis 

The Company utilizes a variety of measurement techniques to evaluate the impact of interest rate risk, including simulating the impact of changing interest rates on expected future interest income and interest expense, to estimate the Company's net interest income sensitivity. This simulation is run monthly and includes various scenarios that help management understand the potential risks in the Company's net interest income sensitivity. These scenarios include both parallel and non-parallel rate shocks as well as other scenarios that are consistent with quantifying the four elements of risk described above. This information is used to develop proactive strategies to ensure that the Company&#8217;s risk position remains within SHUSA Board of Directors-approved limits so that future earnings are not significantly adversely affected by future interest rates. 

The table below reflects the estimated sensitivity to the Company&#8217;s net interest income based on interest rate changes at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019: 

The following estimated percentage increase/(decrease) to net interest income would result If interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Down 100 basis points (1.08) % (1.12) % Up 100 basis points 1.94 % 1.31 % Up 200 basis points 3.71 % 2.56 % 

MVE Analysis 

The Company also evaluates the impact of interest rate risk by utilizing MVE modeling. This analysis measures the present value of all estimated future cash flows of the Company over the estimated remaining life of the balance sheet. MVE is calculated as the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities. The MVE calculation utilizes only the current balance sheet, and therefore does not factor in any future changes in balance sheet size, balance sheet mix, yield curve relationships or product spreads, which may mitigate the impact of any interest rate changes. 

Management examines the effect of interest rate changes on MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk, and highlights the potential capital at risk due to adverse changes in market interest rates. The following table discloses the estimated sensitivity to the Company&#8217;s MVE at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

The following estimated percentage increase/(decrease) to MVE would result If interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Down 100 basis points (5.82) % (3.01) % Up 100 basis points 1.25 % (0.49) % Up 200 basis points 0.19 % (3.17) % 

As of September 30, 2020, the Company&#8217;s profile reflected a decrease of MVE of 5.82% for downward parallel interest rate shocks of 100 basis points and an increase of 1.25 % for upward parallel interest rate shocks of 100 basis points. The asymmetrical sensitivity between up 100 and down 100 shock is due to the negative convexity as a result of the prepayment option embedded in mortgage-related products, the impact of which is not fully offset by the behavior of the funding base (largely NMDs). 

In downward parallel interest rate shocks, mortgage-related products&#8217; prepayments increase, their duration decreases and their market value appreciation is therefore limited. At the same time, with deposit rates remaining at comparatively low levels, the Company cannot effectively transfer interest rate declines to its NMD customers. For upward parallel interest rate shocks, extension risk weighs on a sizable portion of the Company&#8217;s mortgage-related products, which are predominantly long-term and fixed-rate; and for larger shocks, the loss in market value is not offset by the change in NMDs. 

Limitations of Interest Rate Risk Analyses 

Since the assumptions used are inherently uncertain, the Company cannot predict precisely the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or MVE. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, the difference between actual experience and the assumed volume, characteristics of new business, behavior of existing positions, and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among other factors.

Uses of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks 

To mitigate interest rate risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange, equity and credit risks, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income, the fair value of assets and liabilities, and cash flows. 

Through the Company&#8217;s capital markets and mortgage banking activities, it is subject to price risk. The Company employs various tools to measure and manage price risk in its portfolios. In addition, SHUSA's Board of Directors has established certain limits relative to positions and activities. The level of price risk exposure at any point in time depends on the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements, and will vary from period to period. 

Management uses derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate movements on the fair value of certain liabilities, assets and highly probable forecasted cash flows. These instruments primarily include interest rate swaps that have underlying interest rates based on key benchmark indices and forward sale or purchase commitments. The nature and volume of the derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk depend on the level and type of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the risk management strategies for the current and anticipated interest rate environments. 

The Company's derivatives portfolio includes mortgage banking interest rate lock commitments, forward sale commitments and interest rate swaps. As part of its overall business strategy, the Bank originates residential mortgages. It sells a portion of this production to the FHLMC, the FNMA, and private investors. The Company uses forward sales as a means of hedging against the economic impact of changes in interest rates on the mortgages that are originated for sale and on interest rate lock commitments. 

The Company typically retains the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans that are sold. The majority of the Company's residential MSRs are accounted for at fair value. As deemed appropriate, the Company economically hedges MSRs, using interest rate swaps and forward contracts to purchase MBS. For additional information on MSRs, see Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Foreign exchange contracts, which include spot and forward contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. Exposure to gains and losses on these contracts increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate. 

The Company also utilizes forward contracts to manage market risk associated with certain expected investment securities sales and equity options, which manage its market risk associated with certain customer deposit products. 

For additional information on foreign exchange contracts, derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
