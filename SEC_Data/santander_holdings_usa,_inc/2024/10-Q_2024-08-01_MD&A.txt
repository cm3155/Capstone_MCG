 ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

SHUSA is the parent holding company of SBNA, a national banking association; SC, a consumer finance company headquartered in Dallas, Texas; BSI, a financial services company headquartered in Miami, Florida that offers a full range of banking services to foreign individuals and corporations based primarily in Latin America; SanCap, an institutional broker-dealer headquartered in New York, which has significant capabilities in market-making via an experienced fixed-income sales and trading team and a focus on structuring and advisory services for asset originators in the real estate and specialty finance markets; SSLLC, a broker-dealer headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts; and several other subsidiaries. SHUSA is headquartered in Boston and SBNA's home office is in Wilmington, Delaware. SSLLC is a registered investment adviser with the SEC. SHUSA's two largest subsidiaries by asset size and revenue are SBNA and SC. SHUSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Santander. 

The Company specializes in consumer financing focused on vehicle finance, servicing of third-party vehicle financing, and delivering service to dealers and customers across the full credit spectrum. This includes indirect origination and servicing of vehicle loans and leases, principally through manufacturer-franchised dealers in connection with their sale of new and used vehicles to retail consumers, origination of vehicle loans through a web-based direct lending program, purchases of vehicle loans from other lenders, and servicing of automobile and recreational and marine vehicle portfolios for other lenders. The Company sells consumer vehicle loans and leases through flow agreements and, when market conditions are favorable, it accesses the ABS market through securitizations of consumer vehicle loans and leases. 

Since May 2013, under the MPLFA with Stellantis, the Company has operated as Stellantis' preferred provider for consumer loans, leases and dealer loans and provides services to Stellantis customers and dealers under the CCAP brand. In the second quarter of 2022, the Company announced it had reached an agreement with Stellantis to amend and extend the MPLFA through December 2025. In June 2022, the Company launched a preferred lender, full spectrum financing program in partnership with MMNA to provide customer and dealer financing programs that will help MMNA achieve its goal of improving the car-buying experience. 

During the second half of 2023, the Company entered into numerous new lending agreements with various auto OEMs. These new agreements reinforce the Company&#8217;s leadership in the U.S. auto finance market and commitment to forging deep, multi-geography relationships with automotive manufacturers catering to customers across the credit spectrum. These various OEMs have a diverse product lineup, including an increased focus on electric vehicles. In addition, the Company has been chosen by LendingClub to be its primary loan servicer for its auto refinance program. 

In addition to specialized consumer finance, the Company also attracts deposits and provides other retail banking services through its network of retail branches with locations in Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island and originates small business, middle market, large and global commercial loans, multifamily loans, and other consumer loans and leases throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern areas of the United States. For large institutional investors, the Company provides structured products, emerging markets credit and U.S. investment grade credit, U.S. rates, short-term fixed-income, debt and equity capital markets, investment banking, exchange-traded derivatives, and cash equities, benefiting from a combination of Santander&#8217;s global reach and access to financial hubs together with extensive local market knowledge and regional expertise. 

The Company uses its deposits, public and private borrowings, as well as other financing sources, to fund its loan and investment portfolios. 

In December 2023, SBNA acquired a 20 percent interest in the Structured LLC for approximately $1.1 billion. The Structured LLC was established by the FDIC to hold and service a $9.0 billion portfolio primarily consisting of New York based rent-controlled and rent-stabilized multifamily loans retained by the FDIC following a recent bank failure. SBNA's 20 percent interest is reported as an AFS debt security that had a fair value of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively As of June 30, 2024, SBNA serviced approximately $8.8 billion of multi-family loans for the Structured LLC and receives a market rate servicing fee in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 

Overview 

The unemployment rate at June 30, 2024 was 4.1% compared to 3.8% at March 31, 2024 and 3.6% one year ago. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment continued to trend up in government, health care, social assistance, and construction. 

Market year-to-date returns for the following indices based on closing prices for the period indicated were: 

June 30, 2024 Dow Jones Industrial Average 3.8% S&#38;P 500 18.1% NASDAQ Composite 18.1% 

At its June 2024 meeting, the FOMC maintained the federal funds rate target range of 5.25% - 5.50%. The FOMC continues to focus its policy making on maximum employment and achieving a 2.0% inflation target rate. 

The ten-year Treasury bond rate at June 30, 2024 was 4.34%, up from 3.87% at December 31, 2023. 

One of the primary metrics used by the market to monitor the strength of the used car market is the Manheim Used Vehicle Index. The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, based on the 1997 Manheim based index, decreased from 204 at December 31, 2023 to 196.1 at June 30, 2024. 

Recent Events Affecting the Financial Services Industry 

In response to the current interest rate environment and recent events affecting the financial services industry, the Company has enhanced its monitoring of interest rate and liquidity risks. Additional information related to these matters can be found in the sections of this MD&#38;A captioned "Deposits", "Bank Regulatory Capital", "Liquidity and Capital Resources", and "Asset and Liability Management". 

The failure of several large U.S. banking institutions in early 2023 has led to increased market uncertainty. The Company was not materially impacted by these events; however, changing market conditions are considered a significant risk factor to the Company. These factors have increased competition and pricing on customer deposits over the short and medium term, and heightened market and regulatory focus and reform on liquidity, capital, and interest rate risk. As a result, the FDIC published a proposed rule, which was finalized on November 16, 2023, to charge certain banks a special assessment to recover the costs associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the bank closures during 2023. Based on the initial final rule, SBNA would be required to pay a total of $61.5 million over the course of eight consecutive quarters beginning with the first quarter 2024 assessment period. SBNA accrued for the full amount of the special assessment during the fourth quarter of 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, the FDIC communicated that it would increase the assessment for all banks, which was reported in its June 2024 special assessment invoice. During the second quarter of 2024, SBNA recorded an additional $10.7 million to be paid over the course of two additional quarters. Refer to the &#8220;Regulatory Matters&#8221; section of the MD&#38;A for further details. These changing market conditions and uncertainty will likely present challenges in the growth of net interest income, and increased credit risk and associated credit loss expense, and could have an overall impact on the Company's results of operations. It is not possible to quantify the impact of changing market conditions, uncertainty, or regulatory action on the Company's results of operations.

Credit Rating Actions 

The following table presents Moody&#8217;s, S&#38;P and Fitch credit ratings for SBNA, SHUSA, and Santander senior debt / long-term issuer: 

SANTANDER (1) 

SHUSA

Baa1 Stable S&#38;P A+ / A- BBB+ A- Stable 

(1) Senior preferred debt / senior non-preferred rating 

(2) Moody's rating represents SBNA long-term issuer rating 

SHUSA funds its operations independently of the other entities owned by Santander, and believes its business is not necessarily closely relat ed to the business or outlook of other entities owned by Santander. Future changes in the credit ratings of its parent, Santander, or the Kingdom of Spain, however, could impact SHUSA's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings, and any other change in the condition of Santander could affect SHUSA. 

REGULATORY MATTERS 

The activities of the Company and its subsidiaries, including SBNA and SC, are subject to regulation under various U.S. federal laws and regulatory agencies which impose regulations, supervise and conduct examinations, and may affect the operations and management of the Company and its ability to take certain actions, including making distributions to our parent, Santander. The Company is regulated on a consolidated basis by the Federal Reserve, including the FRB of Boston, and the CFPB. The Company's subsidiaries are further supervised by the OCC, the FRB of Atlanta, and the New York Department of Financial Services. 

The Federal Reserve tailors its supervisory programs and regulatory requirements by category based on firm-specific characteristics such as total assets, cross-jurisdictional activity, and nonbank asset or off-balance sheet exposure. As of June 30, 2024, SHUSA was designated a Category IV institution under the Federal Reserve's tailoring rule. Institutions that change to a higher category would become subject to the requirements of the new category, as outlined by the Federal Reserve, generally within two quarters of the change in category. 

On July 27, 2023, the regulatory agencies issued an NPR to modify the definition of cross-jurisdictional activity, which would expand the scope of exposures included in the measurement of cross-jurisdictional activity and has the potential to move certain firms into a higher supervisory category under the Federal Reserve&#8217;s tailoring rule. The Company does not expect to be materially impacted by this NPR once finalized. 

Payment of Divid ends 

SHUSA is the parent holding company of SBNA. SHUSA and SBNA are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including regulatory capital minimums and the requirement to remain "well-capitalized" under prompt corrective action regulations. Refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this MD&#38;A for detail of the capital actions of the Company and its subsidiaries during the period. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules are applicable to both SHUSA and SBNA. 

These rules include prompt corrective action thresholds that require banking organizations, including the Company and SBNA, to maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total capital ratio of 8.0% and a minimum leverage ratio, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets for the quarter, of 4.0%. A further capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above these minimum ratios is required for banking institutions to make capital distributions, including paying dividends. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

As described in Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, on January 1, 2020, we adopted the CECL standard, which upon adoption resulted in a reduction to our opening retained earnings balance, net of income tax, and an increase to the allowance for loan losses of approximately $2.5 billion. The U.S. banking agencies in December 2018 approved a final rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing banking organizations, including the Company, the option to phase in the day-one impact of CECL until the first quarter of 2023. On March 26, 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. SHUSA remains in the three-year transition period. This interim rule was subsequently updated with technical amendments in a final rule dated September 30, 2020, which was elected by the Company. 

See the "Bank Regulatory Capital" section of this MD&#38;A for the Company's capital ratios under Basel III standards. The implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the Company's regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors, including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the Company. 

Material restrictions can be imposed on SBNA, including restrictions on interest payable on accounts, dismissal of management and, in critically undercapitalized situations, appointment of a receiver or conservator. Critically undercapitalized banks generally may not make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt and all but well-capitalized banks are prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Pursuant to the FDIA and OCC regulations, institutions which are not categorized as well-capitalized or adequately-capitalized are restricted from making capital distributions, which include cash dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers, interest payments on certain convertible debt and other transactions charged to the capital account of the institution. At June 30, 2024, SBNA met the criteria to be classified as &#8220;well-capitalized.&#8221; 

On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule to simplify capital rules for large banks. Under the final rule, firms' supervisory stress test results are now used to establish the size of the SCB requirement. The SCB is calculated as the maximum decline in CET1 in the severely adverse scenario (subject to a 2.5% floor) plus four quarters of dividends. The rule results in new firm-specific regulatory capital expectations which are equal to 4.5% of CET1 plus the SCB, any GSIB surcharge, and any countercyclical capital buffer. The GSIB buffer is applicable only to the largest and most complex firms and does not apply to SHUSA. In the event a firm falls below its new minimums, the rule imposes restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. Firms continue to submit a capital plan annually. Supervisory expectations for capital planning processes do not change under the final rule. As of June 30, 2024, SHUSA's SCB CET1 minimum requirement was 7.0%. SHUSA&#8217;s SCB CET1 minimum requirement is expected to increase to 8.0% as of October 1, 2024. 

On July 27, 2023, the federal banking agencies issued a capital proposal that would make significant changes to the regulatory capital rules applicable to large banking organizations (including SHUSA and SBNA) and banking organizations with significant trading activity. This proposal would implement the final elements of the Basel III capital framework and make other changes to the regulatory capital rules in response to recent bank failures. The capital proposal would establish the expanded risk-based approach for calculating RWAs that would apply to large banking organizations. The expanded risk-based approach would include a new more risk-sensitive standardized approach for measuring credit risk and operational risk. It would also include new standardized approaches for measuring market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk but would allow the use of internal models for market risk in certain circumstances with regulatory approval. Under the capital proposal, a large banking organization would be required to calculate its risk-based capital ratios under both the expanded risk-based approach and the current standardized approach and would use the lower of the two. All capital buffer requirements, including the SCB requirement, would apply regardless of whether the expanded risk-based approach or the existing standardized approach produces the lower ratio. 

The total RWA calculation used in the expanded risk-based approach would be phased in over a three-year period starting on July 1, 2025. The requirement to reflect AOCI in regulatory capital would also be phased in over a three-year period starting on July 1, 2025. All other elements of the calculation of regulatory capital would apply on the effective date of the final rule, which is expected to be on or about July 1, 2025. On October 20, 2023, the federal banking agencies announced that they extended the comment period on the capital proposal from November 30, 2023 until January 16, 2024. In addition to pushing back the comment deadline, the Federal Reserve indicated it would begin collecting data to gather more information from the banks affected by the proposal. That data collection also ended on January 16, 2024. The proposed rules and their impact on SHUSA are under review. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Liquidity Rules 

The Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC have established a rule to implement the Basel III LCR for certain internationally active banks and nonbank financial companies, and a modified version of the LCR for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active. The LCR is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to its expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon. Smaller covered companies (but with more than $50 billion in assets) such as the Company are required to calculate the LCR monthly. 

Resolution Planning 

The DFA requires the Company to prepare and update resolution plans. The 165(d) resolution plan must assume that the covered company is resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and that no &#8220;extraordinary support&#8221; is received from the U.S. or any other government. The most recent 165(d) resolution plan was submitted to the Federal Reserve and FDIC in June 2022. In addition, under amended FDIA rules, the IDI resolution plan rule requires that a bank with assets of $50 billion or more develop a plan for its resolution that supports depositors&#8217; rapid access to their insured deposits, maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets, and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by creditors in resolution. 

On June 20, 2024, the FDIC issued a final rule, that will take effect on October 1, 2024, which revises the IDI resolution planning requirements. The final rule requires IDIs with assets of $100 billion or more, including SBNA, to submit a full resolution plan every three years, with interim supplements filed in the off-years. 

Long-Term Debt Requirements 

On July 28, 2023, the Federal Reserve and FDIC issued an NPR that would require banks with total assets of $100 billion or more to maintain a layer of long-term debt from the holding company to improve financial stability by increasing the resolvability and resiliency of such institutions. By requiring each such large bank to maintain a minimum amount of long-term debt to absorb losses, the proposal would increase the options available to resolve such banks in case of failure. Additionally, by reducing the risk that uninsured depositors would face losses, long-term debt can reduce the speed and severity of bank runs and limit the risk of contagion when a bank is under stress. The proposal would provide a three-year phase-in period and would also allow certain outstanding long-term debt to count toward the minimum requirements to provide banks with a reasonable period to transition to the required characteristics of eligible long-term debt instruments. Comments on the proposal were due on November 30, 2023. SHUSA remains subject to the TLAC requirements outlined below. 

Deposit Insurance and Assessments 

On October 18, 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule, applicable to all IDIs, to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by two basis points consistent with the amended restoration plan approved by the FDIC on June 21, 2022. The FDIC indicated that it was taking this action in order to restore the DIF reserve ratio to the required statutory minimum of 1.35% by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028. The FDIC indicated that the reserve ratio had declined below this level because of the increase in insured deposits since the start of the pandemic and other factors that affect the level of the DIF. Under the final rule, the increase in rates began with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023 and will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds 2% in order to support growth in the DIF in progressing toward the FDIC&#8217;s long-term goal of a 2% reserve ratio. The increase in assessment rates applies to SBNA. 

The recent failure of several large U.S. banking institutions has led to increased market uncertainty. Under the FDIA, the loss to the DIF arising from the use of the systemic risk exception must be recovered through one or more special assessments on IDIs, depository institution holding companies, or both, as the FDIC determines to be appropriate. On May 11, 2023, the FDIC issued for public comment a proposed rule to impose a special assessment on IDIs to recover the loss to the DIF resulting from the use of the systemic risk exception to protect the uninsured depositors of the failed U.S. banking institutions. The final rule was issued on November 16, 2023. Under the final rule, the FDIC would collect a special assessment from IDIs at a quarterly rate of approximately 3.36 basis points over eight quarterly assessment periods, starting with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024. In June of 2024 the FDIC added an additional assessment to be collected at a quarterly rate of approximately 2.34 basis points over an additional two quarters, resulting in an additional accrual of $10.7 million that was recorded during the second quarter of 2024. The assessment base for the special assessment is equal to an IDI&#8217;s estimated uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits held by the IDI. The special 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

assessment is a tax-deductible operating expense for IDIs, and the effect on income of the entire amount of the special assessment will occur in one quarter for the IDIs subject to the assessment. The total impact of the special assessment is $72.1 million. 

TLAC 

The TLAC Rule requires certain U.S. organizations to maintain a minimum amount of loss-absorbing instruments, including a minimum amount of unsecured LTD. The TLAC Rule applies to U.S. GSIBs and to IHCs with $50 billion or more in U.S. non-branch assets that are controlled by a global systemically important FBO. The Company is such an IHC. 

Under the TLAC Rule, companies are required to maintain a minimum amount of TLAC, which consists of a minimum amount of LTD and Tier 1 capital. As a result, SHUSA must hold the higher of 18% of its RWAs or 9% of its total consolidated assets in the form of TLAC, of which 6% of its RWAs or 3.5% of total consolidated assets must consist of LTD. In addition, SHUSA must maintain a TLAC buffer composed solely of CET1 capital and will be subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments based on the size of the TLAC buffer it maintains. 

Volcker Rule 

Section 13 of the BHCA, commonly referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule,&#8221; prohibits a &#8220;banking entity&#8221; from engaging in &#8220;proprietary trading&#8221; or engaging in any of the following activities with respect to a Covered Fund: (i) acquiring or retaining any equity, partnership or other ownership interest in the Covered Fund; (ii) controlling the Covered Fund; or (iii) engaging in certain transactions with the fund if the banking entity or any affiliate is an investment adviser or sponsor to the Covered Fund. These prohibitions are subject to certain exemptions for permitted activities. 

Because the term &#8220;banking entity&#8221; includes an IDI, a depository institution holding company and any of their affiliates, the Volcker Rule has sweeping worldwide application and covers entities such as Santander, the Company, and certain of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries (including SBNA and SC), as well as other Santander subsidiaries in the United States and abroad. 

The Company implemented certain policies and procedures, training programs, recordkeeping, internal controls and other compliance requirements that were necessary to comply with the Volcker Rule. As required by the Volcker Rule, the compliance infrastructure has been tailored to each banking entity based on its size and its level of trading and Covered Fund activities. SHUSA's compliance program includes, among other things, processes for prior approval of new activities and investments permitted under the Volcker Rule, and testing and auditing for compliance. 

Risk Retention Rule 

The Federal Reserve's final credit risk retention rule generally requires sponsors of ABS to retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing ABS. SHUSA, primarily through SC and SBNA, is an active participant in the structured finance markets and complies with these retention requirements. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Market Risk Rule 

The market risk rule requires certain national banks to measure and hold risk-based regulatory capital for the market risk of their covered positions. The bank must measure and hold capital for its market risk using its internal risk-based models. The market risk rule outlines quantitative requirements for the bank's internal risk-based models, as well as qualitative requirements for the bank's management of market risk. Banks subject to the market risk rule must also measure and hold market risk regulatory capital for the specific risk associated with certain debt and equity positions. 

A bank is subject to the market risk capi tal rules if its consolidated trading activity, defined as the sum of trading assets and liabilities as reported in its FFIEC 031 and FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, equals the lesser of: (1) 10 percent or more of the bank's total assets as reported in its Call Report and FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, or (2) $1 billion or m ore. The Bank and the Company are required to comply with the market risk component within RWAs of the risk-based capital ratios and submit the FFIEC 102 - Market Risk Regulatory Report. 

SHUSA is integrating SanCap's market risk exposures into SHUSA&#8217;s U.S. market risk rule program, which is a primary driver of the decline in market risk RWAs during the quarter. 

Heightened Standards 

OCC guidelines to strengthen the governance and risk management practices of large financial institutions are commonly referred to as &#8220;heightened standards.&#8221; The heightened standards apply to insured national banks, like SBNA, with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets. The heightened standards require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activities. The heightened standards also provide minimum standards for the institutions&#8217; boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

Depository institutions must remain in compliance with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve's Regulation W, which governs transactions between SBNA and affiliated companies and individuals. Section 23A imposes limits on certain specified &#8220;covered transactions,&#8221; which include loans, lines and letters of credit to affiliated companies or individuals, and investments in affiliated companies, as well as certain other transactions with affiliated companies and individuals. 

Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act prohibits a depository institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are considered arms'-length. As a U.S. domiciled subsidiary of a global parent with significant non-bank affiliates, the Company faces elevated compliance risk in this area. 

Regulation AB II 

Regulation AB II, among other things, expanded disclosure requirements and modified the offering and shelf registration process for ABS. SC must comply with these rules, which impact all offerings of publicly registered ABS and all reports under the Exchange Act, for outstanding publicly-registered ABS, and affect SC's public securitization platform. 

CRA 

SBNA is subject to the requirements of the CRA, which requires the appropriate federal financial supervisory agency to assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which it is located. SBNA&#8217;s current CRA rating is "Outstanding." The OCC takes into account SBNA&#8217;s CRA rating in considering certain regulatory applications SBNA makes, including applications related to establishing and relocating branches, and the Federal Reserve does the same with respect to certain regulatory applications the Company makes. 

In October 2023, the supervisory agencies jointly adopted a final CRA rule to modernize the regulation. The rule intends to adapt to industry changes, such as the growth of online, mobile, and branchless banking and hybrid models, while continuing a focus on low and moderate communities. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The rule also seeks to introduce greater clarity and consistency by implementing a metrics-based approach to evaluate performance and expanding activity that may be considered for CRA credit. This results in significant data collection and reporting requirements for banks with over $10 billion in assets such as SBNA. The rule also imposes new criteria for banks to establish assessment areas outside of the communities in which they have a physical presence if certain criteria are met. 

In March 2024, a preliminary injunction was granted to pause implementation of the new rule while the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas decides the merits of a lawsuit brought by the American Bankers Association against the regulatory agencies for exceeding their statutory authority in adopting the rule. 

SBNA remains committed to the goals of the CRA and supports efforts to modernize the rule through greater transparency regarding evaluation ratings, promoting consistent interpretations of CRA, and encouraging increased economic development in low and moderate-income communities. Management continues to monitor he court proceedings and will adjust SBNA's CRA plans once the status of the new rule becomes known. 

Broker-Dealer Regulation 

The Broker-Dealers are registered with the SEC and subject to the regulation of the SEC, FINRA, the CFTC, the CME, and the NFA. These entities are subject to the SEC&#8217;s uniform net capital rule, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital levels. In addition, these entities are required to maintain proper controls over customer funds and securities and ensure that customer assets are not used for the benefit of the Broker-Dealer. These requirements also restrict the Broker-Dealer&#8217;s ability to withdraw capital. Prior written notification to and approval from the applicable regulators is required for withdrawals exceeding 30 percent of the Broker-Dealer&#8217;s excess net capital and also where the Broker-Dealer&#8217;s net capital would be less than 25 percent of deductions from its net worth in computing net capital. 

Edge Act Corporation Requirements 

Edge Act corporations such as BSI are chartered under Section 25A of the Federal Reserve Act. These entities are subject to specific regulatory requirements under Regulation K. Permissible activities of Edge Act and agreement corporations include those incidentals to international or foreign business. Deposit-taking, credit, and fiduciary and investment advisor services are subject to applicable Federal Reserve regulations. Edge Act corporations are also subject to the USA Patriot Act as well as all applicable laws and regulations designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities.

CREDIT LOSS EXPENSE (BENEFIT) 

The Company had credit loss expense of $481.2 million and $886.2 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to a credit loss expense of $208.9 million and $751.3 million for the corresponding periods in 2023. The credit loss expense during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024 was mainly due to RICs and personal unsecured loans charge-offs, partially offset by the decrease in ACL driven by improvement in the macroeconomic outlook for certain macro variables, seasonally expected lower delinquencies in RICs and auto loans, sale of certain RICs and auto loans and lower exposure in personal unsecured loans. 

Credit loss expense on commercial loans decreased $1.9 million and decreased $39.3 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, primarily driven by improved macroeconomic scenarios, pay-offs and charge-offs, partially offset by rating downgrades in the Multifamily portfolio. 

Credit loss expense on consumer loans increased $278.4 million and increased $182.1 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, primarily driven by reserves build up during the second quarter of 2024. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was offset by the release of approximately $96.0 million of reserves related to the sale of approximately $1.1 billion of gross RICs during the first quarter of 2024. Net charge-offs on the consumer loan portfolios increased $114.0 million and increased $246.9 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, as current year activity reflects normalization in credit performance post pandemic. In addition, there has been an increase in net charge-offs in the personal unsecured loan portfolio because of high borrowing costs and persistent inflation. 

The credit loss expense on unfunded credit losses for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024 decreased $4.1 million and decreased $7.8 million compared to the corresponding periods in 2023.

Total general, administrative and other expenses decreased $4.1 million and increased $12.0 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The most significant contributing factors to these changes were as follows: 

&#8226; Technology, outside services, and marketing expense increased $24.9 million and $39.9 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, due to increasing technology costs related to continued banking system build outs. 

&#8226; Loan expense decreased $1.3 million and $22.2 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, due to lower origination costs. 

&#8226; Lease expense decreased $58.9 million and $84.4 million for the three months and six months and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, due to lower auto lease volumes resulting in lower depreciation expense. 

INCOME TAX PROVISION 

Income tax benefit of $49.8 million and $42.1 million was recorded for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to expense of $64.6 million and $92.8 million for the corresponding periods in 2023. This resulted in an ETR of (13.7)% and (5.9)% for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 10.1% and 9.6% for the corresponding periods in 2023. 

The ETR for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 2.2%, compared to the ETR for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was (13.7)% and for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was (5.9)%. The quarter over quarter change is primarily the result of a decrease in the annual forecasted pre tax income during the second quarter of 2024. 

The ETR for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and six months ended June 30, 2024 periods when compared to the ETR of the same periods in 2023, was directly impacted by an increased level of forecasted electric vehicle tax credits expected to be generated in 2024. 

The Company's ETR in future periods will be affected by the results of operations allocated to the various tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates, any change in income tax laws or regulations within those jurisdictions, and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the Company's interpretations by tax authorities that examine tax returns filed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

&#8226; Net interest income decreased $20.0 million and decreased $29.3 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. These decreases were primarily driven by higher funding costs. 

&#8226; Total non-interest income increased $13.2 million and increased $39.2 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. These increases were primarily driven additional transaction fees on increased security transaction activity.

Commercial 

Commercial loans decreased approximately $848.9 million, or 2.2%, from December 31, 2023 to June 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in C&#38;I loans of $604.3 million and a decrease in Multifamily loans of $404.2 million, partially offset by an increase in CRE loans of $220.1 million. 

Consumer Loans Secured By Real Estate 

Consumer loans secured by real estate decreased $378.5 million from December 31, 2023 to June 30, 2024. This decrease primarily resulted from the Company&#8217;s decision to stop the origination of new residential mortgage and home equity loans in the first quarter of 2022. 

Consumer Loans Not Secured By Real Estate 

RICs and auto loans 

RICs and auto loans increased $1.2 billion from December 31, 2023 to June 30, 2024. RICs are collateralized by vehicle titles, and the lender has the right to repossess the vehicle in the event the consumer defaults on the payment terms of the contract. A significant portion of the Company's RICs HFI are pledged against warehouse lines or securitization bonds. Refer to further discussion of these in Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

As of June 30, 2024, 59% of the Company's RIC and auto loan portfolio balance was comprised of nonprime loans (defined by the Company as customers with a FICO score of below 640) with customers who did not qualify for conventional consumer finance products as a result of, among other things, a lack of or adverse credit history, low income levels and/or the inability to provide adequate down payments. This also includes 6.1% of loans for which no FICO score was available. While underwriting guidelines are designed to establish that the customer would be a reasonable credit risk, nonprime loans will nonetheless experience higher default rates than a portfolio of obligations of prime customers. Additionally, higher unemployment rates, higher gasoline prices, unstable real estate values, re-sets of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates, the general availability of consumer credit, and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could lead to an increase in delinquencies, defaults, and repossessions, as well as decreased consumer demand for used automobiles and other consumer products, weaken collateral values and increase losses in the event of default. Because of the historical focus for such credit has been predominantly on nonprime consumers, the actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses on these loans could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn. 

The Company's automated originations process for these credits reflects a disciplined approach to credit risk management to mitigate the risks of nonprime customers. The Company's robust historical data on both organically originated and acquired loans provides it with the ability to perform advanced loss forecasting. Each applicant is automatically assigned a proprietary custom score using information such as FICO scores, DTI ratios, LTV ratios, and over 30 other predictive factors, placing the applicant in one of 100 pricing tiers. The pricing in each tier is continuously monitored and adjusted to reflect market and risk trends. In addition to the Company's automated process, it maintains a team of underwriters for manual review, consideration of exceptions, and review of deal structures with dealers. 

Personal unsecured and other consumer loans 

Personal unsecured and other consumer loans HFI decreased $721.8 million from December 31, 2023 to June 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily attributable to run-off in the Lending Club portfolio.

(1) Annualized net loan charge-offs are based on year to date charge-offs. 

Commercial net charge-offs during the period to average loans increased from June 30, 2023 to June 30, 2024. The increase in net charge-offs was primarily due to deterioration in the portfolio and other factors such as high interest rates and persistent inflation. Consumer net charge-offs during the period to average loans increased from June 30, 2023 to June 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to current year activity in RICs reflecting normalization in credit performance post pandemic. In addition, there has been an increase in net charge-offs in personal unsecured loans portfolio because of high borrowing costs and persistent inflation. 

Commercial 

Commercial NPLs increased $22.1 million from December 31, 2023 to June 30, 2024. Commercial NPLs accounted for 1.4% of commercial LHFI at June 30, 2024. The change in commercial NPLs was primarily comprised of an increase of $33.8 million in the multifamily portfolio, an increase of $1.4 million in the CRE portfolio and a decrease of $14.8 million in the C&#38;I portfolio. Increases in NPLs in these portfolios are primarily driven by higher interest rates, persistent inflation, and the deteriorated macroeconomic outlook. 

Consumer Loans Secured by Real Estate 

NPLs in the residential mortgage portfolio decreased year-over-year primarily resulting from the Company&#8217;s decision to stop the origination of new residential mortgage and home equity loans in the first quarter of 2022. Foreclosures on consumer loans secured by real estate were $58.8 million or 46.4% of non-performing consumer loans secured by real estate at June 30, 2024, compared to $67.1 million, or 48.3%, of consumer loans secured by real estate at December 31, 2023. 

Consumer Loans Not Secured by Real Estate 

RICs 

RICs are classified as non-performing when they are more than 60 DPD (i.e., 61 or more DPD) with respect to principal or interest. Except for loans accounted for using the FVO, at the time a loan is placed on non-performing status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income. When an account is 60 days or less past due, it is returned to performing status and the Company returns to accruing interest on the loan. NPLs in the RIC and auto loan portfolio decreased by $167.4 million from December 31, 2023 to June 30, 2024. Non-performing RICs and auto loans accounted for 4.5% and 5.0% of total RICs and auto loans at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Personal unsecured loans 

The accrual of interest on revolving personal loans continues until the loan is charged off. Credit cards are charged off when they are 180 days delinquent or within 60 days after the receipt of notification of the cardholder&#8217;s death or bankruptcy. NPLs in the personal unsecured portfolio decreased by $4.8 million from December 31, 2023 to June 30, 2024. Non-performing personal unsecured loans accounted for 0.5% and 0.5% of total personal unsecured loans at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Delinquencies 

Early stage delinquency in commercial loans totaled approximately $164.6 million and $201.2 million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Early stage delinquency consumer loans amounted to $5.3 billion and $5.6 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Management has included these loans in its evaluation of the Company's ACL and reserved for them during the respective periods. 

The Company generally considers an account delinquent when an obligor fails to pay substantially all (defined as 90%) of the scheduled payment by the due date. Overall, total delinquencies decreased by $400.8 million from December 31, 2023 to June 30, 2024. The main driver of this is the decrease in past due auto loans due to seasonal improvement in payment performance. 

Loan Modifications 

Loan modifications occur when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the loan is modified with terms that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower. In these cases, the Company agrees to make certain concessions to both meet the needs of customers and maximize its ultimate recovery on the loans. The types of concessions granted are generally interest rate reductions, limitations on accrued interest charged, term extensions, covenant waivers and deferments of principal. 

Modified loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status upon modification, unless the loan was performing immediately prior to modification. For most portfolios, modified loans may return to accrual status after a sustained period of repayment performance, as long as the Company believes the principal and interest of the restructured loan will be paid in full. RIC modifications are placed on nonaccrual status when the Company believes repayment under the revised terms is not reasonably assured and, at the latest, when the account becomes more than 60 DPD. RIC modifications are considered for return to accrual when the account becomes 60 days or less past due. To the extent the modified loan is determined to be collateral-dependent, and the source of repayment depends on the operation of the collateral, the loan may be returned to accrual status based on the foregoing parameters. To the extent the modified loan is determined to be collateral-dependent, and the source of repayment depends on disposal of the collateral, the loan may not be returned to accrual status. 

The Company evaluates the results of its deferral strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred compared to the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time. Based on this evaluation, the Company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio. 

Changes in deferral levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of consumer finance receivables charged-off. However, the timing of a charge-off may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge-off. To the extent deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged-off, historical charge-off ratios, and cash flow forecasts used in the determination of the adequacy of the ALLL for loans classified as modified are also impacted. Increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the ALLL and related credit loss expense. Changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of the ALLL and related credit loss expense. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02. This guidance removes the specific accounting and disclosure guidance for TDR designations and enhances disclosure requirements related to modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2023 on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. The effect of this implementation was an increase in the ACL of approximately $55.2 million, a decrease in retained earnings of approximately $41.4 million and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities of approximately $13.8 million. Refer to Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on modified loans. 

During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company provided loan modifications to customers with an amortized cost basis at June 30, 2024 of $522.7 million and $871.3 million, respectively, compared to $356.0 million and $793.9 million for the corresponding periods in 2023. Loan modifications primarily consist of payment deferrals in the RIC and auto loan portfolio. The increase in payment deferrals in the RIC and auto loan portfolio during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 was primarily driven by increased demand for payment deferrals, higher loan balances and the use of payment deferrals in place of other loan modification programs. 

CREDIT RISK 

The risk inherent in the Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolios is driven by credit and collateral quality and is affected by borrower-specific and economy-wide factors such as changes in unemployment, GDP, HPI, CRE price index, used vehicle index, and other factors. In general, there is an inverse relationship between credit quality of transactions and projections of impairment losses so that transactions with better credit quality require a lower expected loss. The Company manages this risk through its underwriting, pricing and credit approval guidelines and servicing policies and practices, as well as geographic and other concentration limits. 

The Company's ACL is principally based on various models subject to the Company's Model Risk Management Framework. New models are approved by the Company's Model Risk Management Committee. Models, inputs and documentation are further reviewed and validated at least annually, and the Company completes a detailed variance analysis of historical model projections against actual observed results on a quarterly basis. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its ACL Committee. 

To the extent permitted by applicable law, management uses the qualitative framework to exercise judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and that are not considered by the quantitative framework. These adjustments are documented and reviewed through the Company&#8217;s risk management processes. Furthermore, management reviews, updates, and validates its process and loss assumptions on a periodic basis. This process involves an analysis of data integrity, review of loss and credit trends, a retrospective evaluation of actual loss information to loss forecasts, and other analyses. 

ACL levels are collectively reviewed for adequacy and approved quarterly. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its ACL Committee. The ACL levels are approved by the Board-level committees quarterly. 

ACL 

The Company's ACL was $6.8 billion at June 30, 2024, a decrease of $221.8 million from December 31, 2023. The decrease in the ACL was primarily driven by improvement in the macroeconomic outlook for certain macro variables, seasonally expected lower delinquencies in RICs and auto loans, sale of certain RICs and auto loans and lower exposure in personal unsecured loans. The ACL for the consumer segment decreased by $182.0 million, and the ACL for the commercial segment decreased $39.8 million for the period ended June 30, 2024 compared to the period ended December 31, 2023. Refer to the rollforward of the ACL in Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments 

The reserve for unfunded lending commitments decreased from $60.8 million at December 31, 2023 to $53.1 million at June 30, 2024.

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

BANK REGULATORY CAPITAL 

The Company&#8217;s capital priorities are to support client growth and business investment while maintaining appropriate capital for a range of macroeconomic outcomes. 

The Company is subject to the regulations of certain federal, state, and foreign agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities. At June 30, 2024 and 2023, based on SBNA&#8217;s capital calculations, SBNA was considered well-capitalized under the applicable capital framework. In addition, the Company's capital levels as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, based on the Company&#8217;s capital calculations, exceeded the required capital ratios for BHCs. 

For a discussion of U.S. Basel III, including the standardized approach and related anticipated future changes to the minimum U.S. regulatory capital ratios, see the section captioned "Regulatory Matters" in this MD&#38;A. 

Federal banking laws, regulations and policies also limit SBNA&#8217;s ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to the Company. SBNA must obtain prior OCC approval to declare a dividend or make any other capital distribution if, after such dividend or distribution: (1) the Bank's total distributions to SHUSA within that calendar year would exceed 100% of its net income during the year plus retained net income for the prior two years, (2) the Bank would not meet capital levels imposed by the OCC in connection with any order, (3) the Bank has negative retained earnings, or (4) the Bank is not adequately capitalized at the time. The OCC's prior approval would also be required if SBNA were notified by the OCC that it is a problem institution or in troubled condition. 

Any dividend declared and paid or return of capital has the effect of reducing capital ratios. Refer to the section captioned "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for discussion of the Company's dividends. 

The following schedule summarizes the actual capital ratios of SHUSA and SBNA at June 30, 2024: 

SHUSA June 30, 2024 Well-capitalized Requirement Minimum Requirement CET1 capital ratio 12.62 &#160; % 6.50 % 4.50 % Tier 1 capital ratio 14.47 &#160; % 8.00 % 6.00 % Total capital ratio 16.59 &#160; % 10.00 % 8.00 % Leverage ratio 9.85 &#160; % 5.00 % 4.00 %

DEPOSITS 

The Company reported deposits of $76.8 billion and $77.1 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

At June 30, 2024, SBNA had $75.2 billion of U.S.-based deposits, including $3.9 billion of deposits from SHUSA affiliates that eliminate in consolidation. Uninsured U.S.-based deposits were $27.5 billion and $26.3 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and represented approximately 37% and 35% of all U.S. deposits at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

SBNA attracts deposits primarily through its retail branch network located within the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern areas of the United States, located throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Delaware, with one location outside this region in Florida.

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Overall 

The Company continues to maintain strong liquidity. Liquidity represents the ability of the Company to obtain cost-effective funding to meet the needs of customers as well as the Company's financial obligations. Factors that impact the liquidity position of the Company include loan origination volumes, loan prepayment rates, the maturity structure of existing loans, core deposit growth levels, CD maturity structure and retention, the Company's credit ratings, investment portfolio cash flows, the maturity structure of the Company's wholesale funding, and other factors. These risks are monitored and managed centrally. The Company's Asset/Liability Committee reviews and approves the Company's liquidity policy and guidelines on a regular basis. This process includes reviewing all available wholesale liquidity sources. The Company also forecasts future liquidity needs and develops strategies to ensure adequate liquidity is available at all times. SHUSA conducts monthly liquidity stress test analyses to manage its liquidity under a variety of scenarios, all of which demonstrate that the Company has ample liquidity to meet its short-term and long-term cash requirements. 

Enhanced Monitoring of Liquidity 

In addition to its normal monitoring of liquidity, SBNA enhanced monitoring of its liquidity position since the recent financial system market disruption that began in March 2023 and the ensuing market volatility. Additionally, SBNA continues to optimize contingent sources of liquidity. Some of these actions include the pledge of additional loans to the FRB discount window, and the transfer of loans from the discount window to the FHLB in order to receive more favorable discounts. Overall, the available capacity from the FRB and FHLB remained stable throughout and since 2023. 

Impact of Changes to Credit Rating on Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Changes to the credit ratings of SHUSA, Santander and its affiliates or the Kingdom of Spain could have a material adverse effect on SHUSA's business, including its liquidity and capital resources. The credit ratings of SHUSA have changed in the past and may change in the future, which could impact its cost of and access to sources of financing and liquidity. Any reductions in the long-term or short-term credit ratings of SHUSA would increase its borrowing costs and require it to replace funding lost due to the downgrade, which may include the loss of customer deposits, limit its access to capital and money markets and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivatives contracts and other secured funding arrangements. See further discussion on the impacts of credit ratings actions in the "Economic and Business Environment" section of this MD&#38;A. 

Sources of Liquidity 

The Company has several sources of funding to meet liquidity requirements, including the core deposit base, liquid investment securities portfolio, ability to acquire large deposits, FHLB borrowings, wholesale deposit purchases, and federal funds purchased, as well as through securitizations in the ABS market and committed credit lines from third-party banks and Santander. In addition, the Company has other sources of funding to meet its liquidity requirements such as dividends and returns of investments from its subsidiaries, short-term investments held by non-bank affiliates, and access to the capital markets. 

The specialized consumer financing of RICs requires a significant amount of liquidity to originate and acquire loans and leases and to service debt. The Company funds these operations through its lending relationships with third-party banks, Santander and affiliates, and through securitizations in the ABS market. The Company seeks to issue debt that appropriately matches the cash flows of the assets that it originates. The Company uses liquidity for debt service and repayment of borrowings, as well as for funding loan commitments. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company's subsidiaries completed on-balance and off-balance sheet funding transactions totaling approximately $9.8 billion, including CLNs of: 

&#8226; securitizations on SC's SDART platform for approximately $4.2 billion 

&#8226; securitizations on SC's DRIVE platform for approximately $0.9 billion 

&#8226; lease securitizations on SBNA's SBALT platform for approximately $3.0 billion 

&#8226; issuance of retained bonds for approximately $0.5 billion 

&#8226; issuance of CLNs for approximately $0.2 billion 

&#8226; off-balance sheet securitization on SBNA's SBAT platform for approximately $1.0 billion 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Santander provides a liquidity line to SHUSA for the purpose of supporting additional liquidity for SHUSA and its subsidiaries CIB business activities. At June 30, 2024, SHUSA had $4.0 billion in available liquidity on the line, of which it had drawn zero. 

Intercompany Borrowings with SHUSA Affiliates 

SHUSA provides notes payable and revolving loans and lines to its subsidiaries as needed for the purpose of providing additional liquidity to support business operations at the subsidiary level.

Cash flows from operating activities 

Net cash flow from operating activities decreased by $919.7 million from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to the change in net trading activity, a decrease in net income, and an increase in originations and purchases of LHFS, offset by an increase in proceeds from the sales of and collections on LHFS during the six months ended June 30, 2024. 

Cash flows from investing activities 

Net cash flow from investing activities decreased by $1.4 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024 primarily driven by the net change in Securities Financing Activities, offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of LHFI and a decrease in purchases of and contributions to equity method and other investments. 

Cash flows from financing activities 

Net cash flow from financing activities decreased by $735.1 million from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily driven by the net change in borrowings activity, a decrease in deposits activity, and a decrease in preferred stock offerings, offset by the net change in Securities Financing Activities and lower dividends paid on common stock. 

See the SCF for further details on the Company's sources and uses of cash. 

Credit Facilities 

Third-Party Revolving Credit Facilities 

Warehouse Lines 

The Company's subsidiaries have a credit facility with several banks providing an aggregate commitment of $700.0 million for the exclusive use of providing short-term liquidity needs to support preferred auto lessor financing. As of June 30, 2024, there was an outstanding balance of $368.4 million on this facility. The facility requires reduced advance rates in the event of delinquency, credit loss, or residual loss ratios, as well as other metrics exceeding specified thresholds. 

In addition, the Company's subsidiaries have credit facilities with several banks providing an aggregate commitment of $7.2 billion for the exclusive use of providing short-term liquidity to support core and preferred auto lender financing. As of June 30, 2024, there was an outstanding balance of $3.3 billion on these facilities in the aggregate. These facilities reduced advance rates in the event of delinquency, credit loss, as well as various other metrics exceeding specific thresholds. 

Securities Financing Activities 

The Company may enter into Securities Financing Activities primarily to deploy the Company&#8217;s excess cash and investment positions. Securities Financing Activities are treated as collateralized financings and are included in "Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements or similar arrangements" an d "Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements" on the Company&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets . Refer to Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's Securities Financing Activities. 

Secured Structured Financings 

The Company's subsidiaries' secured structured financings primarily consist of public, SEC-registered securitizations, as well as private securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, and privately issued amortizing notes. As of June 30, 2024, there were on-balance sheet securitizations outstanding in the market with a cumulative balance of approximately $22.0 billion. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Deficiency and Debt Forward Flow Agreement 

In addition to SC's credit facilities and secured structured financings, SC has a flow agreement in place with a third party for charged-off assets. Loans and leases sold under these flow agreements are not on SC's balance sheet. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing 

SC agreed to provide SBNA with origination support services in connection with the processing, underwriting, and purchasing of retail loans and leases, all of which are serviced by SC. These loans and leases are on the balance sheet of SBNA. 

Uses of Liquidity 

The Company uses liquidity for debt service and repayment of borrowings. In addition, our subsidiaries use liquidity for funding loan commitments, satisfying deposit withdrawal requests, supporting underwriting transactions and meeting customer liquidity requirements. 

At June 30, 2024, the Company's liquidity to meet debt payments, debt service and debt maturities was in excess of 12 months. 

Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments 

The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business as a source of funds for its asset growth and asset/liability management and to meet required capital needs. These obligations require the Company to make cash payments over time. 

As of June 30, 2024, the Company had total contractual cash obligations of $91.7 billion, which included FHLB advances, notes payable, other debt obligations, CDs, repurchase agreements, non-qualified pension and post-retirement benefits, and operating leases. Of this amount, approximately $55.2 billion of the total contractual cash obligations is due within one year. In addition, the Company had other commitments of $25.8 billion, which consisted of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Of this amount, approximately $6.9 billion of the other commitments is due within one year. 

The Company is a party to financial instruments and other arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. See further discussion on these risks in Note 12 and Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Dividends, Contributions and Stock Issuances 

As of June 30, 2024, the Company had 530,391,043 shares of common stock outstanding.

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT 

Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Company&#8217;s traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in market interest rates, and consumer preferences, affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Interest rate risk is managed by the Company's Treasury group and measured by its Market Risk Department, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Committee. In managing interest rate risk, the Company seeks to minimize the variability of net interest income across various likely scenarios, while at the same time maximizing net interest income and the net interest margin. To achieve these objectives, the Treasury group works closely with each business line in the Company. The Treasury group also uses various other tools to manage interest rate risk, including wholesale funding maturity targeting, investment portfolio purchase strategies, asset securitizations/sales, and financial derivatives. 

Interest rate risk focuses on managing four elements of risk associated with interest rates: basis risk, repricing risk, yield curve risk and option risk. Basis risk stems from rate index timing differences with rate changes, such as differences in the extent of changes in Federal funds rates compared with the three-month term SOFR. Repricing risk stems from the different timing of contractual repricing, such as one-month versus three-month reset dates, as well as the related maturities. Yield curve risk stems from the impact on earnings and market value resulting from different shapes and levels of yield curves. Option risk stems from prepayment or early withdrawal risk embedded in various products. These four elements of risk are analyzed through a combination of net interest income and balance sheet valuation simulations, shocks to those simulations, and scenario and market value analyses, and the subsequent results are reviewed by management. Several assumptions and models are used to produce these analyses, including assumptions about new business volumes, loan and investment prepayment rates, deposit flows, interest rate curves, economic conditions, and competitor pricing. Certain models use historical data analyses to estimate future customer behavior, such as deposit re-pricing and attrition. Estimates from these models can differ from actual behavior, depending on various factors such as macroeconomic conditions, competitor response, etc.

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis 

The Company utilizes a variety of measurement techniques to evaluate the impact of interest rate risk, including simulating the impact of changing interest rates on expected future interest income and interest expense, to estimate the Company's net interest income sensitivity. This simulation is run monthly and includes various scenarios that help management understand the potential risks in the Company's net interest income sensitivity. These various scenarios include parallel, non-parallel, gradual parallel and gradual non-parallel rate shocks applied relative to the implied market-based forward curve, as well as other scenarios that are consistent with quantifying the four measures of risk described above. The shocks below are extended using the parallel scenario and are applied instantaneously to the implied forward curve as of the stated month-end. The 200 basis point down shock has been added as market rates have increased. This set of shocks represents a range of plausible rate shocks, as an instantaneous shock 200 basis points down can be analogous to a gradual ramp-down of 400 basis points over one year. This information is used to develop proactive strategies to ensure that the Company&#8217;s risk position remains within SHUSA Board of Directors-approved limits so that future earnings are not significantly adversely affected by future interest rates. 

The table below reflects the estimated sensitivity to the Company&#8217;s net interest income based on interest rate changes at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 

The following estimated percentage increase/(decrease) to net interest income would result If interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Down 200 basis points (5.53) % (4.14) % Down 100 basis points (2.65) % (1.94) % Up 100 basis points 2.58 &#160; % 1.82 % Up 200 basis points 5.14 &#160; % 3.63 % 

MVE Analysis 

The Company also evaluates the impact of interest rate risk by utilizing MVE modeling. This analysis measures the present value of all estimated future cash flows of the Company over the estimated remaining life of the balance sheet. MVE is calculated as the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities. The MVE calculation utilizes only the current balance sheet, and therefore does not factor in any future changes in balance sheet size, balance sheet mix, yield curve relationships or product spreads, which may mitigate the impact of any interest rate changes. 

Management examines the effect of interest rate changes on MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk and highlights the potential capital at risk due to adverse changes in market interest rates. The following table discloses the estimated sensitivity to the Company&#8217;s MVE at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

The following estimated percentage increase/(decrease) to MVE would result If interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Down 200 basis points 6.64 &#160; % 6.68 % Down 100 basis points 4.05 &#160; % 4.05 % Up 100 basis points (4.50) % (4.49) % Up 200 basis points (8.86) % (8.76) % 

As of June 30, 2024, the Company&#8217;s profile reflected an increase of MVE of 4.05% for downward parallel interest rate shocks of 100 basis points and a decrease of 4.50% for upward parallel interest rate shocks of 100 basis points. The asymmetrical sensitivity between a 100 basis point increase and a 100 basis point decrease is due to the negative convexity as a result of the prepayment option embedded in mortgage-related products, the impact of which is not fully offset by the behavior of the funding base (largely NMDs). 

In downward parallel interest rate shocks, mortgage-related products&#8217; prepayments increase, their duration decreases, and their market value appreciation is therefore limited. At the same time, with deposit rates remaining at comparatively low levels, the Company cannot effectively transfer interest rate declines to its NMD customers. For upward parallel interest rate shocks, extension risk weighs on a sizable portion of the Company&#8217;s mortgage-related products, which are predominantly long-term and fixed-rate; and for larger shocks, the loss in market value is not offset by the change in NMDs.

Limitations of Interest Rate Risk Analyses 

Since the assumptions used are inherently uncertain, the Company cannot predict precisely the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or MVE. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, the difference between actual experience and the assumed volume, characteristics of new business, behavior of existing positions, and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. 

Uses of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks 

To mitigate interest rate risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange, equity and credit risks, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income, the fair value of assets and liabilities, and cash flows. 

The Company is subject to price risk through its capital markets and mortgage banking activities. The Company employs various tools to measure and manage price risk in its portfolios. In addition, SHUSA's Board of Directors has established certain limits relative to positions and activities. The level of price risk exposure at any point in time depends on the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements and will vary from period to period. 

Management uses derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate movements on the fair value of certain liabilities, assets and highly probable forecasted cash flows. These instruments primarily include interest rate swaps that have underlying interest rates based on key benchmark indices and forward sale or purchase commitments. The nature and volume of the derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk depend on the level and type of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the risk management strategies for the current and anticipated interest rate environments. 

The Company typically retains the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans that are sold. The majority of the Company's residential MSRs are accounted for at fair value. As deemed appropriate, the Company economically hedges MSRs, using interest rate swaps and forward contracts to purchase MBS. For additional information on MSRs, see Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Foreign exchange contracts, which include spot and forward contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. Exposure to gains and losses on these contracts increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate. The Company also utilizes forward contracts to manage market risk associated with certain expected investment securities sales.
