Net interest income decreased $83.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, compared to 2019. The most significant factors contributing to these changes are as follows: 

Interest Income on Investment Securities and Interest-Earning Deposits 

Interest income on investment securities and interest-earning deposits decreased $188.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. The average balances of investment securities and interest-earning deposits for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $26.9 billion with an average yield of 1.35%, compared to an average balance of $22.2 billion with an average yield of 2.49% for the corresponding period in 2019. The decrease in interest income on investment securities and interest-earning deposits for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the average yield on interest-earning deposits resulting from the Federal Reserve response to the outbreak of COVID-19. 

Interest Income on Loans 

Interest income on loans decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019. This decrease reflected decreasing rates, offset by increases in the average balances during 2020. 

Interest Expense on Deposits and Related Customer Accounts 

Interest expense on deposits and related customer accounts decreased $284.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. These decreases were a result of the near zero interest rate environment offset by builds in overall deposits. 

Interest Expense on Borrowed Funds 

Interest expense on borrowed funds decreased $262.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was due to lower interest rates being paid offset by increased balances during the year ended December 31, 2020. The average balance of total borrowings was $49.7 billion with an average cost of 2.76% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to an average balance of $47.2 billion with an average cost of 3.46% for 2019. The average balance of borrowed funds increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increases in credit facilities and secured structured financings. 

CREDIT LOSS EXPENSE 

Credit loss expense was $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.3 billion for the comparative period in 2019. The increase year over year was primarily due to reserve build during the first and second quarters of 2020 associated with a weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. 

Total charge-offs of $3.8 billion for year ended December 31, 2020 were lower by $1.8 billion from the comparative period in 2019 as a result of the Company's programs in response to COVID-19. Total recoveries during these periods also decreased.

Total non-interest income increased $220.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019. The increase for the period ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to an increase in lease income and miscellaneous income, net, partially offset by a decrease in consumer fees. 

Consumer fees 

Consumer fees decreased $53.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily related to a decrease in consumer deposit fees, related to more fee waivers given in 2020 compared to 2019 in response to COVID-19 outbreak. 

Commercial fees 

Commercial fees consists of deposit overdraft fees, deposit automated teller machine fees, cash management fees, letter of credit fees, and loan syndication fees for commercial accounts. 

Lease income 

Lease income increased $164.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. This increase was the result of the growth in the Company's lease portfolio, with an average balance of $16.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $15.3 billion for 2019.

Miscellaneous income increased $107.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019. The increase is primarily related to an increase in gain on sale of operating leases. The change in other miscellaneous (loss) income, net is primarily due to the fair value adjustment on the transfer of BSPR's loan portfolio to HFS, partially offset by the gain recognized on the sale of SBC.

Total general, administrative and other expenses increased $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019. The most significant contributing factors were as follows: 

&#8226; During the second quarter of 2020 the Company took a $1.8 billion goodwill impairment. For additional discussion please see Note 6 and the goodwill section in this MD&#38;A. 

&#8226; Technology, outside services, and marketing expense decreased $108.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was driven by reductions in marketing and technology spending that have resulted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8226; Loan expense decreased $76.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. This is primarily due to the lower repossession volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8226; Lease expense increased $325.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. This increase was primarily due to more depreciation on a larger lease portfolio and fewer liquidations. 

&#8226; Other expenses decreased $126.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the corresponding period in 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in legal and operational risk expenses. Travel and entertainment expenses also saw a significant decrease as COVID-19 has limited corporate travel. 

INCOME TAX PROVISION 

An income tax benefit of $110.6 million and a provision of $472.2 million were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This resulted in an ETR of 14.4% and 31.2% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

The Company's ETR in future periods will be affected by the results of operations allocated to the various tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates, any change in income tax laws or regulations within those jurisdictions, and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the Company's interpretations by tax authorities that examine tax returns filed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 

Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year-to-year comparison of the ETR.

CBB reported a loss before income taxes of $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a loss before income taxes of $118.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Factors contributing to this change were: 

&#8226; Non-interest income decreased $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period of 2019. This decrease was due to a one-time gain recorded on the sale of branches in 2019, and decreased fee income in 2020 resulting from lower transaction volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8226; Credit loss expense increased $219.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period of 2019. This increase was due to large reserve builds in response to the economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 outbreak and the growing auto loan portfolio. 

&#8226; Total expenses increased $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period of 2019. This increase was due to the goodwill impairment that was recorded in the second quarter of 2020.

CIB reported income before income taxes of $134.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to income before income taxes of $84.8 million for 2019. Factors contributing to these changes were: 

&#8226; Total non-interest income increased $55.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period of 2019. This increase was due to the increase in fee income resulting from the large amounts of debt underwritten during 2020 in response to the COVID-19 related economic uncertainty, and higher fixed income revenues. 

&#8226; Credit loss expense increased $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period of 2019. This increase was due to large reserve builds in response to the economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 outbreak.

&#8226; Net interest income decreased $250.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period of 2019, due to lower rates. 

&#8226; Total non-interest income decreased $86.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period of 2019, due to fair value adjustments related to the transfer of loans to HFS in the second quarter of 2020, offset by the gain on sale of SBC. 

&#8226; Credit loss expense decreased $129.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period of 2019, due to the release of provision related to SBC during the second quarter of 2020.

(1) As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $338.5 million of commercial loans that were denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. 

Commercial 

Commercial loans decreased approximately $1.3 billion, or 3.3%, from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. This decrease was comprised of decreases in CRE loans of $1.1 billion and multifamily loans of $274.1 million. This decrease is reflective of the sale of SBC, largely in the CRE and C&#38;I portfolios, offset by originations of C&#38;I loans, including PPP loans.

Consumer Loans Secured By Real Estate 

Consumer loans secured by real estate decreased $2.9 billion, or 21.4%, from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. This decrease was comprised of decreases in the residential mortgage portfolio of $2.2 billion, which is partially attributable to the sale of SBC, and decreases in the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio of $661.8 million. 

Consumer Loans Not Secured By Real Estate 

RICs and auto loans 

RICs and auto loans increased $4.2 billion, or 11.6%, from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. The increase in the RIC and auto loan portfolio was primarily due to an increase in originations, net of securitizations. RICs are collateralized by vehicle titles, and the lender has the right to repossess the vehicle in the event the consumer defaults on the payment terms of the contract. Most of the Company's RICs HFI are pledged against warehouse lines or securitization bonds. Refer to further discussion of these in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

As of December 31, 2020, 62.5% of the Company's RIC and auto loan portfolio balance was comprised of nonprime loans (defined by the Company as customers with a FICO score of below 640) with customers who did not qualify for conventional consumer finance products as a result of, among other things, a lack of or adverse credit history, low income levels and/or the inability to provide adequate down paym ents. This also includes 8.5% of loans for which no FICO score was available or legacy portfolios for which FICO is not considered in the ALLL model. While underwriting guidelines are designed to establish that the customer would be a reasonable credit risk, nonprime loans will nonetheless experience higher default rates than a portfolio of obligations of prime customers. Additionally, higher unemployment rates, higher gasoline prices, unstable real estate values, re-sets of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates, the general availability of consumer credit, and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could lead to an increase in delinquencies, defaults, and repossessions, as well as decreased consumer demand for used automobiles and other consumer products, weaken collateral values and increase losses in the event of default. Because SC's historical focus for such credit has been predominantly on nonprime consumers, the actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses on these loans could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn. 

The Company's automated originations process for these credits reflects a disciplined approach to credit risk management to mitigate the risks of nonprime customers. The Company's robust historical data on both organically originated and acquired loans provides it with the ability to perform advanced loss forecasting. Each applicant is automatically assigned a proprietary custom score using information such as FICO scores, DTI ratios, LTV ratios, and over 30 other predictive factors, placing the applicant in one of 100 pricing tiers. The pricing in each tier is continuously monitored and adjusted to reflect market and risk trends. In addition to the Company's automated process, it maintains a team of underwriters for manual review, consideration of exceptions, and review of deal structures with dealers. 

At December 31, 2020, a typical RIC was originated with an average annual percentage rate of 14.1% and was purchased from the dealer at a premium of 1.1%. All of the Company's RICs and auto loans are fixed-rate loans. 

Personal unsecured and other consumer loans 

Personal unsecured and other consumer loans decreased from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 by $560.5 million. 

As a result of the strategic evaluation of SC's personal lending portfolio, in the third quarter of 2015, SC began reviewing strategic alternatives for exiting its personal loan portfolios. SC's other significant personal lending relationship is with Bluestem. SC continues to perform in accordance with the terms and operative provisions of the agreements under which it is obligated to purchase personal revolving loans originated by Bluestem for an initial term ending in 2020 renewable through April 2022 at Bluestem's option. The Bluestem loan portfolio is carried as held-for-sale in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, the Company has recorded lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments on this portfolio, and there may be further such adju stments required in future period financial statements. Management is currently evaluating alternatives for the Bluestem portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, SC's personal unsecured portfolio was held-for-sale and thus does not have a related allowance.

(1) Annualized net loan charge-offs are based on year-to-date charge-offs. 

The increase in the ALLL as a percentage of total NPLs is a result of the adoption of the CECL standard effective January 1, 2020. 

Potential problem loans are loans not currently classified as NPLs for which management has doubts about the borrowers&#8217; ability to comply with the present repayment terms. These assets are principally loans delinquent for more than 30 days but less than 90 days. Potential problem commercial loans totaled approximately $229.2 million and $179.9 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. This increase was primarily due to one large borrower within the multifamily portfolio. 

Potential problem consumer loans amounted to $3.2 billion and $4.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Management has included these loans in its evaluation of the Company's ACL and reserved for them during the respective periods. 

Non-performing assets decreased to $2.0 billion, or 1.3% of total assets, at December 31, 2020, compared to $2.5 billion, or 1.6% of total assets, at December 31, 2019, due to lower NPLs resulting from COVID-19 deferral program. 

Commercial 

Commercial NPLs increased $32.6 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Commercial NPLs accounted for 0.8% of commercial LHFI at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase in commercial NPLs was primarily comprised of increases of $67.3 million in the multifamily and $23.6 million in the CRE portfolios offset by decreases of $46.4 million in C&#38;I. 

Consumer Loans Not Secured by Real Estate 

RICs and amortizing personal loans are classified as non-performing when they are more than 60 DPD (i.e., 61 or more DPD) with respect to principal or interest. Except for loans accounted for using the FVO, at the time a loan is placed on non-performing status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income. When an account is 60 days or less past due, it is returned to performing status and the Company returns to accruing interest on the loan. The accrual of interest on revolving personal loans continues until the loan is charged off. 

RIC TDRs are placed on non-accrual status when the account becomes past due more than 60 days. For loans in non-accrual status, interest income is recognized on a cash basis. For loans on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest is resumed if a delinquent account subsequently becomes 60 days or less past due. NPLs in the RIC and auto loan portfolio decreased by $469.1 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Non-performing RICs and auto loans accounted for 2.9% and 4.5% of total RICs and auto loans at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

Consumer Loans Secured by Real Estate 

The following table shows NPLs compared to total loans outstanding for the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively: 

##TABLE_START December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands) Residential mortgages Home equity loans and lines of credit Residential mortgages Home equity loans and lines of credit NPLs - HFI $ 74,473 &#160; $ 91,606 &#160; $ 134,957 $ 107,289 Total LHFI 6,590,168 &#160; 4,108,505 &#160; 8,835,702 4,770,344 NPLs as a percentage of total LHFI 1.1 &#160; % 2.2 &#160; % 1.5 % 2.2 % ##TABLE_END

The NPL ratio is usually higher for the Company's residential mortgage loan portfolio compared to the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio due to a number of factors, including the prolonged workout and foreclosure resolution processes for residential mortgage loans, differences in risk profiles, and mortgage loans located outside the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States. Foreclosures on consumer loans secured by real estate were $46.2 million or 27.8% of non-performing consumer loans secured by real estate at December 31, 2020, compared to $111.3 million or 45.9% of consumer loans secured by real estate at December 31, 2019. 

Delinquencies 

The Company generally considers an account delinquent when an obligor fails to pay substantially all (defined as 90%) of the scheduled payment by the due date. 

Overall, total delinquencies decreased by $1.5 billion, or 26.7%, from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, most significantly within the RICs and auto loan portfolio, which decreased $1.5 billion. Delinquent balances and nonaccrual balances overall were lower as of December 31, 2020 primarily due to the large number of deferrals granted to borrowers impacted by COVID-19. 

TDRs 

TDRs are loans that have been modified as the Company has agreed to make certain concessions to both meet the needs of customers and maximize its ultimate recovery on the loans. TDRs occur when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the loan is modified with terms that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower. The types of concessions granted are generally interest rate reductions, limitations on accrued interest charged, term extensions, and deferments of principal. 

TDRs are generally placed on nonaccrual status upon modification, unless the loan was performing immediately prior to modification. For most portfolios, TDRs may return to accrual status after a sustained period of repayment performance, as long as the Company believes the principal and interest of the restructured loan will be paid in full. RIC TDRs are placed on nonaccrual status when the Company believes repayment under the revised terms is not reasonably assured and, at the latest, when the account becomes more than 60 DPD. RIC TDRs are considered for return to accrual when the account becomes 60 days or less past due. To the extent the TDR is determined to be collateral-dependent and the source of repayment depends on the operation of the collateral, the loan may be returned to accrual status based on the foregoing parameters. To the extent the TDR is determined to be collateral-dependent and the source of repayment depends on disposal of the collateral, the loan may not be returned to accrual status. 

The following table summarizes TDRs at the dates indicated:

The decrease in total delinquent TDRs was primarily due to the significant increase in deferrals provided to borrowers in response to COVID-19 impacts. 

In accordance with the Company&#8217;s policies and guidelines, the Company may offer extensions (deferrals) to consumers on its RICs, whereby the consumer is allowed to move a maximum of three payments per event to the end of the loan. Prior to March 2020, the Company&#8217;s policies and guidelines limited the frequency of each new deferral to one deferral every six months, regardless of the length of any prior deferral. Further, the maximum number of lifetime months extended for all automobile RICs was eight, while some marine and RV contracts had a maximum of twelve months extended to reflect their longer term. Additionally, the Company generally limited the granting of deferrals on new accounts until a requisite number of months have passed since origination. However, many of these practices have been temporarily revised to accommodate borrowers impacted by COVID-19, including increasing the maximum number of extensions, allowing more than one deferral every six months and removing the requirement that a requisite number of months have passed since origination. During the deferral period, the Company continues to accrue and collect interest on the loan in accordance with the terms of the deferral agreement. 

However in March 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an &#8220;Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus.&#8221; This guidance encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers that may be unable to meet their contractual obligations because of the effects of COVID-19 and concludes that short-term modifications (e.g., six months) made on a good faith basis to borrowers who were impacted by COVID-19 and who were less than 30 DPD as of the implementation date of a relief program are not TDRs. Additionally, Section 4013 of the CARES Act grants companies the option of not applying the GAAP TDR guidance to certain loans with COVID-19 modifications. 

In March 2020, the Company began actively working with its borrowers impacted by COVID-19 and provided loan modification programs to mitigate the adverse effects of COVID-19. In both its consumer and commercial portfolios, the programs generally include payment deferrals for a period of one to six months. In the Company's RIC and auto loan portfolio, the predominant program offering is a deferral of payments to the end of the loan term and waiver of late charges of up to three months. For credit cards, we offer a temporary payment reduction program for a period of up to three months. Payment deferrals on mortgages can be for up to one year. The Company does not consider payment deferrals of up to six months to customers who were current prior to implementation of the Company's relief programs to be TDRs, in accordance with its accounting policy and interagency regulatory guidelin es. Additionally, the Company applies the TDR provisions of the CARES Act to certain consumer loans that received COVID19 modifications, if they were current as of December 31, 2019. Consumer loans that are granted deferrals beyond 180 days are not classified as TDRs if they comply with the requirements of the CARES Act. 

Since the implementation of the programs in March 2020, we experienced a sharp increase in requests for extensions related to COVID-19 nationwide and a significant number of such extensions have been granted. 

The following table provides a summary of SBNA and SC loan balances with active payment deferrals due to COVID-19 as of the end of each reporting period:

(1) Santander Consumer balances exclude deferrals with payments due in the current month. 

As of December 31, 2020, over 44,000 SBNA customer accounts have received extensions. Of these accounts, 79% had exited deferral, 10% remain in active deferral and 11% had paid down or charged off. Of the loans that have exited deferral status, 92% of the customer accounts are less than 30 DPD. Past due status is based on the modified payment schedule under the deferral arrangement. 

Through December 31, 2020, over 697,000 of SC's unique accounts have received COVID-19 deferrals. Of these accounts, 79% have exited deferral status, 8% remain in active deferral, 8% have paid-off, and 5% have charged off. Of the loans that have exited deferral status, 80% are less than 30 DPD and 98% of these accounts have made at least one payment since their first COVID-19 extension. 

The Company evaluates the results of its deferral strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred compared to the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time. Based on this evaluation, the Company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio. 

Changes in deferral levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of consumer finance receivables charged-off. However, the timing of a charge-off may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge-off. To the extent deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged-off, historical charge-off ratios, loss confirmation periods, and cash flow forecasts used in the determination of the adequacy of the ALLL for loans classified as TDRs are also impacted. Increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the ALLL and related credit loss expense. Changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of the ALLL and related credit loss expense. For loans that are classified as TDRs, the Company generally compares the present value of expected cash flows to the outstanding recorded investment of TDRs to determine the amount of allowance and related credit loss expense that should be recorded. For loans that are considered collateral-dependent, such as certain bankruptcy modifications, impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral, less its estimated costs to sell. 

CREDIT RISK 

The risk inherent in the Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolios is driven by credit and collateral quality, and is affected by borrower-specific and economy-wide facts such as changes in unemployment, GDP, HPI, CRE price index, used vehicle index growth rates, and other factors. In general, there is an inverse relationship between credit quality of transactions and projections of impairment losses so that transactions with better credit quality require a lower expected loss. The Company manages this risk through its underwriting, pricing and credit approval guidelines and servicing policies and practices, as well as geographic and other concentration limits. 

The Company's ACL is principally based on various models subject to the Company's Model Risk Management Framework. New models are approved by the Company's Model Risk Management Committee. Models, inputs and documentation are further reviewed and validated at least annually, and the Company completes a detailed variance analysis of historical model projections against actual observed results on a quarterly basis. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its ACL Committee. 

Management uses the qualitative framework to exercise judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and that are not considered by the quantitative framework. These adjustments are documented and reviewed through the Company&#8217;s risk management processes. Furthermore, management reviews, updates, and validates its process and loss assumptions on a periodic basis. This process involves an analysis of data integrity, review of loss and credit trends, a retrospective evaluation of actual loss information to loss forecasts, and other analyses. 

ACL levels are collectively reviewed for adequacy and approved quarterly. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its ACL Committee. The ACL levels are approved by the Board-level committees quarterly. 

ACL 

Changes to the ACL are discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments 

The reserve for unfunded lending commitments increased from $91.8 million at December 31, 2019 to $146.5 million at December 31, 2020. The increase of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments included an increase from the adoption of the CECL standard of $10.4 million, while the remainder was primarily related to changes in the business environment resulting from COVID-19. The net impact of business as usual change in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments to the overall ACL was immaterial. 

INVESTMENT SECURITIES 

Investment securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasuries, MBS, ABS and FHLB and FRB stock. MBS consist of pass-through, CMOs and adjustable rate mortgages issued by federal agencies. The Company&#8217;s MBS are either guaranteed as to principal and interest by the issuer or have ratings of &#8220;AAA&#8221; by S&#38;P and Moody&#8217;s at the date of issuance. The Company&#8217;s AFS investment strategy is to purchase liquid fixed-rate and floating-rate investments to manage the Company's liquidity position and interest rate risk adequately. 

Total investment securities AFS decreased $3.0 billion to $11.3 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $14.3 billion at December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the composition of the Company's investment portfolio changed due to a decrease in U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by an increase in MBS. U.S. Treasuries decreased by $3.9 billion primarily due to investment sales and maturities. MBS increased by $907.1 million primarily due to investment purchases and an increase in unrealized gains, partially offset by investment sales, maturities and principal paydowns. For additional information with respect to the Company&#8217;s investment securities, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Debt securities for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity are classified as HTM securities. HTM securities are reported at cost and adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount. Total investment securities HTM were $5.5 billion at December 31, 2020. The Company had 133 investment securities classified as HTM as of December 31, 2020. 

Total gross unrealized gain/(loss) position on investment securities AFS increased by $184.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily related to an increase in unrealized gains of $186.3 million on MBS, primarily due to a decrease in interest rates. 

The average life of the AFS investment portfolio (excluding certain ABS) at December 31, 2020 was approximately 3.29 years. The average effective duration of the investment portfolio (excluding certain ABS) at December 31, 2020 was approximately 2.35 years. The actual maturities of MBS AFS will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

GOODWILL 

The Company records the excess of the cost of acquired entities over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired less the fair value of liabilities assumed as goodwill. Consistent with ASC 350, the Company does not amortize goodwill, and reviews the goodwill recorded for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the potential for goodwill impairment. At December 31, 2020, goodwill totaled $2.6 billion and represented 1.7% of total assets and 12.2% of total stockholder's equity. The following table shows goodwill by reporting units at December 31, 2020: 

##TABLE_START (in thousands) CBB C&#38;I CRE &#38; VF CIB SC Total Goodwill at December 31, 2020 $ 297,802 $ 52,198 $ 1,095,071 $ 131,130 $ 1,019,960 $ 2,596,161 ##TABLE_END

The Company continually assesses whether or not there have been events requiring a review of goodwill. During the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the ongoing economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company determined that a goodwill triggering event occurred for the CBB, C&#38;I, and CRE &#38; VF reporting units. Based on its goodwill impairment analysis performed as of June 30, 2020, the Company concluded that a goodwill impairment charge of $1.6 billion and $0.3 billion was required for the CBB and C&#38;I reporting units, respectively. The CRE &#38; VF reporting unit&#8217;s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 5%. 

In addition, the Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment tests as of October 1, 2020 using generally accepted valuation methods. 

For the CBB reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, a 25%/75% weighting of the market approach and income approach, respectively, was applied. For the market approach, the Company selected a 30.0% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the marketplace that were determined to be comparable. The projected TBV of 1.0x was selected based on publicly traded peers of the reporting unit. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate of 11.1%, which was most representative of the reporting unit's cost of equity at the time of the analysis. Long-term growth rates of 2.5% were applied in determining the terminal value. The results of the fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the CBB reporting unit by 9.3%, indicating that the reporting unit was not considered to be impaired. 

For the C&#38;I reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, a 25%/75% weighting of the market approach and income approach, respectively, was applied. For the market approach, the Company selected a 30.0% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the marketplace that were determined to be comparable. The projected TBV of 0.9x was selected based on the selected publicly traded peers of the reporting unit. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate 11.4%, which was most representative of the business' cost of equity at the time of the analysis. Long-term growth rates of 2.5% were applied in determining the terminal value. The results of the fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the Commercial Banking reporting unit by 17.8%, indicating that the C&#38;I reporting unit was not considered to be impaired. 

For the CRE&#38;VF reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, a 25%/75% weighting of the market approach and income approach, respectively, was applied. For the market approach, the Company selected a 30.0% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the marketplace that were determined to be comparable. The projected TBV of 1.2x was selected based on the selected publicly traded peers of the reporting unit. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate 11.7%, which was most representative of the business' cost of equity at the time of the analysis. Long-term growth rates of 2.5% were applied in determining the terminal value. The results of the fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the Commercial Banking reporting unit by 6.1%, indicating that the CRE&#38;VF reporting unit was not considered to be impaired or at risk for impairment. 

For the CIB reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, a 25%/75% weighting of the market approach and income approach, respectively, was applied. For the market approach, the Company selected a 30.0% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the marketplace that were determined to be comparable. The projected TBV of 0.9x was selected based on the selected publicly traded peers of the reporting unit. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate of 10.6%, which is most representative of the reporting unit's cost of equity at the time of the analysis. Long-term growth rates of 2.5% were applied in determining the terminal value. The results of the fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the CIB reporting unit by 13.2%, indicating that the CIB reporting unit was not considered to be impaired or at risk for impairment. 

For the SC reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, the Company used only the market capitalization approach. For the market capitalization approach, SC's stock price from October 1, 2020 was $18.59 and a 30.0% control premium was used based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the market-place that were determined to be comparable. The results of the fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value of the SC reporting unit by 8.8%, indicating that the SC reporting unit was not considered to be impaired. Management continues to monitor SC's stock price, along with changes in the financial position and results of operations that would impact the reporting unit's carrying value on a regular basis. Through the date of this filing, there have been no indicators which would change management's assessment as of October 1, 2020. 

During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company implemented organizational changes which resulted in the transfer of Upper Business Banking customers into the C&#38;I segment from the CBB segment. Refer to Note 22 to these Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the Company's reportable segments. As a result of the re-organization, the Company re-allocated approximately $25.1 million of goodwill from the CBB reporting unit to the C&#38;I reporting unit. Upon re-allocation, the Company performed a post evaluation for impairment on the CBB and C&#38;I reporting units utilizing assumptions consistent with our October 1, 2020 impairment test and noted no impairment. 

Management continues to monitor changes in financial position and results of operations that would impact each of the reporting units estimated fair value or carrying value on a regular basis. Through the date of this filing, there have been no indicators which would change management's assessment as of October 1, 2020. 

DEFERRED TAXES AND OTHER TAX ACTIVITY 

The Company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $171.2 million at December 31, 2020 (consisting of a deferred tax asset balance of $11.1 million and a deferred tax liability balance of $182.4 million), compared to a net deferred tax liability balance of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2019 (consisting of a deferred tax asset balance of $503.7 million and a deferred tax liability balance of $1.5 billion). During the third quarter, the Company&#8217;s ownership of SC reached the 80% threshold which requires SC to file a consolidated federal tax return with the Company. As a result, SHUSA reversed its deferred tax liability of $306.6 million for the book over tax basis difference in its investment in SC. The $846.1 million decrease in net deferred liability for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the adoption of the CECL standard during the first quarter of 2020 and the reversal of the deferred tax liability for the book over tax basis difference associated with the Company&#8217;s investment in SC during the third quarter of 2020. 

BANK REGULATORY CAPITAL 

The Company's capital priorities are to support client growth and business investment while maintaining appropriate capital in light of economic uncertainty and the Basel III framework. 

The Company is subject to the regulations of certain federal, state, and foreign agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, based on the Bank&#8217;s capital calculations, the Bank was considered well-capitalized under the applicable capital framework. In addition, the Company's capital levels as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, based on the Company&#8217;s capita l calculations, exceeded the required capital ratios for BHCs. 

For a discussion of Basel III, including the standardized approach and related future changes to the minimum U.S. regulatory capital ratios, see the section captioned "Regulatory Matters" in this MD&#38;A. 

Federal banking laws, regulations and policies also limit the Bank's ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to the Company. The Bank must obtain prior OCC approval to declare a dividend or make any other capital distribution if, after such dividend or distribution: (1) the Bank's total distributions to SHUSA within that calendar year would exceed 100% of its net income during the year plus retained net income for the prior two years, (2) the Bank would not meet capital levels imposed by the OCC in connection with any order, or (3) the Bank is not adequately capitalized at the time. The OCC's prior approval would also be required if the Bank were notified by the OCC that it is a problem institution or in troubled condition. 

Any dividend declared and paid or return of capital has the effect of reducing capital ratios. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 the Company paid cash dividends of $125.0 million, $400.0 million, and $410.0 million respectively, to its common stock shareholder.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Overall 

The Company continues to maintain strong liquidity. Liquidity represents the ability of the Company to obtain cost-effective funding to meet the needs of customers as well as the Company's financial obligations. Factors that impact the liquidity position of the Company include loan origination volumes, loan prepayment rates, the maturity structure of existing loans, core deposit growth levels, CD maturity structure and retention, the Company's credit ratings, investment portfolio cash flows, the maturity structure of the Company's wholesale funding, and other factors. These risks are monitored and managed centrally. The Company's Asset/Liability Committee reviews and approves the Company's liquidity policy and guidelines on a regular basis. This process includes reviewing all available wholesale liquidity sources. The Company also forecasts future liquidity needs and develops strategies to ensure adequate liquidity is available at all times. SHUSA conducts monthly liquidity stress test analyses to manage its liquidity under a variety of scenarios, all of which demonstrate that the Company has ample liquidity to meet its short-term and long-term cash requirements. 

Further changes to the credit ratings of SHUSA, Santander and its affiliates or the Kingdom of Spain could have a material adverse effect on SHUSA's business, including its liquidity and capital resources. The credit ratings of SHUSA have changed in the past and may change in the future, which could impact its cost of and access to sources of financing and liquidity. Any reductions in the long-term or short-term credit ratings of SHUSA would increase its borrowing costs and require it to replace funding lost due to the downgrade, which may include the loss of customer deposits, limit its access to capital and money markets and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivatives contracts and other secured funding arrangements. See further discussion on the impacts of credit ratings actions in the "Economic and Business Environment" section of this MD&#38;A. 

Sources of Liquidity 

Company and Bank 

The Company and the Bank have several sources of funding to meet liquidity requirements, including the Bank's core deposit base, liquid investment securities portfolio, ability to acquire large deposits, FHLB borrowings, wholesale deposit purchases, and federal funds purchased, as well as through securitizations in the ABS market and committed credit lines from third-party banks and Santander. In addition, the Company has other sources of funding to meet its liquidity requirements such as dividends and returns of investments from its subsidiaries, short-term investments held by non-bank affiliates, and access to the capital markets. 

SC 

SC requires a significant amount of liquidity to originate and acquire loans and leases and to service debt. SC funds its operations through its lending relationships with 13 third-party banks, Santander and SHUSA, and through securitizations in the ABS market and flow agreements. SC seeks to issue debt that appropriately matches the cash flows of the assets that it originates. SC has more than $5.6 billion of stockholders&#8217; equity that supports its access to the securitization markets, credit facilities, and flow agreements. 

During the year ended December 31, 2020, SC completed on-balance sheet funding transactions totaling approximately $14.1 billion, including: 

&#8226; private amortizing lease facilities for approximately $4.0 billion; 

&#8226; securitizations on its SDART platform for approximately $5.7 billion; 

&#8226; securitizations on its DRIVE, deeper subprime platform, for approximately $2.0 billion; 

&#8226; lease securitizations on its SRT platform for approximately $2.3 billion; and 

&#8226; issuance of a retained bond on its SRT platform for approximately $54.1 million. 

SC also completed approximately $1.1 billion in asset sales to third parties. 

For information regarding SC's debt, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In 2017, SIS entered into a revolving subordinated loan agreement with SHUSA, not to exceed $290.0 million. This was subsequently increased to $895.0 million in 2018, and will mature in October 2021. 

As needed, SIS will draw down from another subordinated loan with Santander in order to enable SIS to underwrite certain large transactions in excess of the subordinated loan described above. At December 31, 2020, there was no outstanding balance on the subordinated loan. 

BSI's primary sources of liquidity are from customer deposits and deposits from affiliated banks. 

Institutional borrowings 

The Company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress scenarios, and maintains contingency plans consistent with the Company&#8217;s access to diversified sources of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources. These include cash, unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow at the FHLB and the FRB&#8217;s discount window. 

Available Liquidity 

As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had approximately $18.6 billion in committed liquidity from the FHLB and the FRB. Of this amount, $17.1 billion was unused and therefore provides additional borrowing capacity and liquidity for the Company. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents and LHFS) and securities AFS exclusive of securities pledged as collateral) totaled approximately $23.5 billion and $15.0 billion, respectively. These amounts represented 31.8% and 24.3% of total deposits at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank and BSI had $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, in cash held at the FRB. Management believes that the Company has ample liquidity to fund its operations.

Credit Facilities 

Third-Party Revolving Credit Facilities 

Warehouse Lines 

SC uses warehouse facilities to fund its originations. Each facility specifies the required collateral characteristics, collateral concentrations, credit enhancement, and advance rates. SC's warehouse facilities generally are backed by auto RICs or auto leases. These facilities generally have one- or two-year commitments, staggered maturities and floating interest rates. SC maintains daily and long-term funding forecasts for originations, acquisitions, and other large outflows such as tax payments to balance the desire to minimize funding costs with its liquidity needs. 

SC's warehouse facilities generally have net spread, delinquency, and net loss ratio limits. Generally, these limits are calculated based on the portfolio collateralizing the respective line; however, for certain of SC's warehouse facilities, delinquency and net loss ratios are calculated with respect to its serviced portfolio as a whole. Failure to meet any of these covenants could trigger increased overcollateralization requirements or, in the case of limits calculated with respect to the specific portfolio underlying certain credit lines, result in an event of default under these agreements. If an event of default occurred under one of these agreements, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the impacted agreement to be immediately due and payable, enforce their interests against collateral pledged under the agreement, restrict SC's ability to obtain additional borrowings under the agreement, and/or remove SC as servicer. SC has never had a warehouse facility terminated due to failure to comply with any ratio or a failure to meet any covenant. A default under one of these agreements can be enforced only with respect to the impacted warehouse facility. 

SC has one credit facility with eight banks providing an aggregate commitment of $3.5 billion for the exclusive use of providing short-term liquidity needs to support Chrysler Capital lease financing. As of December 31, 2020, there was an outstanding balance of approximately $0.4 billion on this facility in the aggregate. The facility requires reduced advance rates in the event of delinquency, credit loss, or residual loss ratios, as well as other metrics exceeding specified thresholds. 

SC has eight credit facilities with eleven banks providing an aggregate commitment of $8.3 billion for the exclusive use of providing short-term liquidity needs to support core and Chrysler Capital loan financing. As of December 31, 2020, there was an outstanding balance of approximately $3.6 billion on these facilities in the aggregate. These facilities reduced advance rates in the event of delinquency, credit loss, as well as various other metrics exceeding specific thresholds. 

Repurchase Agreements 

SC also obtains financing through investment management or repurchase agreements under which it pledges retained subordinate bonds on its own securitizations as collateral for repurchase agreements with various borrowers and at renewable terms ranging up to 365 days. As of December 31, 2020, there was an outstanding balance of $168.0 million under these repurchase agreements. 

Related Party Credit Facilities 

The Company provides SC with $0.5 billion of committed revolving credit and $2.5 billion of contingent liquidity that can be drawn on an unsecured basis. The Company also provides SC with $6.8 billion of term financing with maturities ranging from March 2021 to May 2025. These loans eliminate in the consolidation of SHUSA. Santander provides SC with $4.0 billion of unsecured financing with maturities ranging from June 2022 and September 2022. 

Secured Structured Financings 

SC's secured structured financings primarily consist of both public, SEC-registered securitizations, as well as private securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, and privately issues amortizing notes. SC has on-balance sheet securitizations outstanding in the market with a cumulative ABS balance of approximately $26.0 billion. 

Deficiency and Debt Forward Flow Agreement 

In addition to SC's credit facilities and secured structured financings, SC has a flow agreement in place with a third party for charged-off assets. Loans and leases sold under these flow agreements are not on SC's balance sheet, but provide a stable stream of servicing fee income and may also provide a gain or loss on sale. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing 

Beginning in 2017, SC had the option to sell a contractually determined amount of eligible prime loans to Santander through securitization platforms. As all of the notes and residual interests in the securitizations are acquired by Santander, SC recorded these transactions as true sales of the RICs securitized, and removed the sold assets from its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Beginning in 2018, this program was replaced with a new program with SBNA, whereby SC has agreed to provide SBNA with origination support services in connection with the processing, underwriting, and purchasing of retail loans, primarily from FCA dealers, all of which are serviced by SC. 

SC also continues to periodically execute securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. After retaining the required credit risk retention via a 5% vertical interest, SC transfers all remaining notes and residual interests in these securitizations to third parties. SC subsequently records these transactions as true sales of the RICs securitized, and removes the sold assets from its Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Uses of Liquidity 

The Company uses liquidity for debt service and repayment of borrowings, as well as for funding loan commitments and satisfying deposit withdrawal requests. SIS uses liquidity primarily to support underwriting transactions. The primary use of liquidity for BSI is to meet customer liquidity requirements, such as maturing deposits, investment activities, funds transfers, and payment of operating expenses. 

At December 31, 2020, the Company's liquidity to meet debt payments, debt service and debt maturities was in excess of 12 months. 

Dividends, Contributions and Stock Issuances 

As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 530,391,043 shares of common stock outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company paid dividends of $125.0 million to its sole shareholder, Santander. 

SC paid a dividend of $0.22 per share in February 2020, May 2020, and August 2020. On September 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve extended the Interim Policy prohibiting share repurchases and limiting dividends to all CCAR banks to the average trailing net income. Based on the Company's expected average trailing four quarters of net income, SC is prohibited from paying a dividend in the fourth quarter of 2020. Although SC&#8217;s standalone income is sufficient to declare and pay a dividend, SC is consolidated into the Company&#8217;s capital plan and, therefore, is subject to the Federal Reserve Board's Interim Policy that utilizes the Company&#8217;s average trailing income to determine the cap on common stock dividends. SC did not declare or pay a dividend in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

SC has paid a total of $212.6 million in dividends through December 31, 2020, of which $50.5 million has been paid to NCI and $162.1 million has been paid to the Company, which eliminates in the consolidated results of the Company. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2020, SC purchased shares of SC Common Stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer. 

In June 2019, SC announced that the SC Board of Directors had authorized purchases by SC of up to $1.1 billion, excluding commissions, of its outstanding common stock effective from the third quarter of 2019 through the end of the second quarter of 2020. SC extended the share repurchase program through the end of the third quarter of 2020. On July 31, 2020, SC announced that the Company&#8217;s request for certain exceptions to the Interim Policy, prohibiting share repurchases and limiting dividends to all CCAR institutions to the average trailing net income, had been approved. Such approval permitted the SC Board of Directors to authorize SC to continue its share repurchase program through the end of the third quarter of 2020. 

On August 10, 2020, SC announced that it had substantially exhausted the amount of shares SC was permitted to repurchase under the previously disclosed exception to the Interim Policy, and that SC has acquired an aggregate of 9.58 million of its shares in a combination of open market and privately negotiated repurchases since July 31, 2020. As a result of these repurchases, SHUSA now owns approximately 80.2% of SC. 

Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Board extended the Interim Policy through the first quarter of 2021. As a result of the extension of the Interim Policy, SC may continue, consistent with the Interim Policy, to repurchase a number of shares of SC Common Stock equal to the amount of share issuances related to SC&#8217;s expensed employee compensation through the first quarter of 2021.

The Company is a party to financial instruments and other arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. See further discussion on these risks in Note 13 and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT 

Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Company&#8217;s traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in market interest rates, and consumer preferences, affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Interest rate risk is managed by the Company's Treasury group and measured by its Market Risk Department, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Committee. In managing interest rate risk, the Company seeks to minimize the variability of net interest income across various likely scenarios, while at the same time maximizing net interest income and the net interest margin. To achieve these objectives, the Treasury group works closely with each business line in the Company. The Treasury group also uses various other tools to manage interest rate risk, including wholesale funding maturity targeting, investment portfolio purchase strategies, asset securitizations/sales, and financial derivatives. 

Interest rate risk focuses on managing four elements of risk associated with interest rates: basis risk, repricing risk, yield curve risk and option risk. Basis risk stems from rate index timing differences with rate changes, such as differences in the extent of changes in Federal funds rates compared with the three-month LIBOR. Repricing risk stems from the different timing of contractual repricing, such as one-month versus three-month reset dates, as well as the related maturities. Yield curve risk stems from the impact on earnings and market value resulting from different shapes and levels of yield curves. Option risk stems from prepayment or early withdrawal risk embedded in various products. These four elements of risk are analyzed through a combination of net interest income and balance sheet valuation simulations, shocks to those simulations, and scenario and market value analyses, and the subsequent results are reviewed by management. Numerous assumptions are made to produce these analyses, including assumptions about new business volumes, loan and investment prepayment rates, deposit flows, interest rate curves, economic conditions and competitor pricing. 

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis 

The Company utilizes a variety of measurement techniques to evaluate the impact of interest rate risk, including simulating the impact of changing interest rates on expected future interest income and interest expense, to estimate the Company's net interest income sensitivity. This simulation is run monthly and includes various scenarios that help management understand the potential risks in the Company's net interest income sensitivity. These scenarios include both parallel and non-parallel rate shocks as well as other scenarios that are consistent with quantifying the four elements of risk described above. This information is used to develop proactive strategies to ensure that the Company&#8217;s risk position remains within SHUSA Board of Directors-approved limits so that future earnings are not significantly adversely affected by future interest rates. 

The table below reflects the estimated sensitivity to the Company&#8217;s net interest income based on interest rate changes at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019: 

##TABLE_START The following estimated percentage increase/(decrease) to net interest income would result If interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Down 100 basis points (1.12) % (1.12) % Up 100 basis points 3.18 % 1.31 % Up 200 basis points 6.25 % 2.56 % ##TABLE_END

MVE Analysis 

The Company also evaluates the impact of interest rate risk by utilizing MVE modeling. This analysis measures the present value of all estimated future cash flows of the Company over the estimated remaining life of the balance sheet. MVE is calculated as the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities. The MVE calculation utilizes only the current balance sheet, and therefore does not factor in any future changes in balance sheet size, balance sheet mix, yield curve relationships or product spreads, which may mitigate the impact of any interest rate changes. 

Management examines the effect of interest rate changes on MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk, and highlights the potential capital at risk due to adverse changes in market interest rates. The following table discloses the estimated sensitivity to the Company&#8217;s MVE at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

##TABLE_START The following estimated percentage increase/(decrease) to MVE would result If interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Down 100 basis points (6.18) % (3.01) % Up 100 basis points 1.62 % (0.49) % Up 200 basis points 0.51 % (3.17) % ##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2020, the Company&#8217;s profile reflected a decrease of MVE of 6.18% for downward parallel interest rate shocks of 100 basis points and an increase of 1.62 % for upward parallel interest rate shocks of 100 basis points. The asymmetrical sensitivity between up 100 and down 100 shock is due to the negative convexity as a result of the prepayment option embedded in mortgage-related products, the impact of which is not fully offset by the behavior of the funding base (largely NMDs). 

In downward parallel interest rate shocks, mortgage-related products&#8217; prepayments increase, their duration decreases and their market value appreciation is therefore limited. At the same time, with deposit rates remaining at comparatively low levels, the Company cannot effectively transfer interest rate declines to its NMD customers. For upward parallel interest rate shocks, extension risk weighs on a sizable portion of the Company&#8217;s mortgage-related products, which are predominantly long-term and fixed-rate; and for larger shocks, the loss in market value is not offset by the change in NMDs. 

Limitations of Interest Rate Risk Analyses 

Since the assumptions used are inherently uncertain, the Company cannot predict precisely the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or MVE. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, the difference between actual experience and the assumed volume, characteristics of new business, behavior of existing positions, and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. 

Uses of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks 

To mitigate interest rate risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange, equity and credit risks, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income, the fair value of assets and liabilities, and cash flows. 

Through the Company&#8217;s capital markets and mortgage banking activities, it is subject to price risk. The Company employs various tools to measure and manage price risk in its portfolios. In addition, SHUSA's Board of Directors has established certain limits relative to positions and activities. The level of price risk exposure at any point in time depends on the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements, and will vary from period to period. 

Management uses derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate movements on the fair value of certain liabilities, assets and highly probable forecasted cash flows. These instruments primarily include interest rate swaps that have underlying interest rates based on key benchmark indices and forward sale or purchase commitments. The nature and volume of the derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk depend on the level and type of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the risk management strategies for the current and anticipated interest rate environments. 

The Company's derivatives portfolio includes mortgage banking interest rate lock commitments, forward sale commitments and interest rate swaps. As part of its overall business strategy, the Bank originates residential mortgages. It sells a portion of this production to the FHLMC, the FNMA, and private investors. The Company uses forward sales as a means of hedging against the economic impact of changes in interest rates on the mortgages that are originated for sale and on interest rate lock commitments. 

The Company typically retains the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans that are sold. The majority of the Company's residential MSRs are accounted for at fair value. As deemed appropriate, the Company economically hedges MSRs, using interest rate swaps and forward contracts to purchase MBS. For additional information on MSRs, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Foreign exchange contracts, which include spot and forward contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. Exposure to gains and losses on these contracts increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate. 

The Company also utilizes forward contracts to manage market risk associated with certain expected investment securities sales and equity options, which manage its market risk associated with certain customer deposit products. 

For additional information on foreign exchange contracts, derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

BORROWINGS AND OTHER DEBT OBLIGATIONS 

The Company has term loans and lines of credit with Santander and other lenders. The Bank utilizes borrowings and other debt obligations as a source of funds for its asset growth and asset/liability management. The Bank also utilizes repurchase agreements, which are short-term obligations collateralized by securities. In addition, SC has warehouse lines of credit and securitizes some of its RICs and operating leases, which are structured secured financings. Total borrowings and other debt obligations at December 31, 2020 were $46.4 billion, compared to $50.7 billion at December 31, 2019. Total borrowings decreased $4.3 billion, primarily due to a decrease in FHLB advances at the Bank of $5.9 billion and $1.4 billion of debt maturities and calls, partially offset by new debt issuances of $2.1 billion and an overall increase in SC debt of $0.8 billion. See further detail on borrowings activity in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The Company's non-GAAP information has limitations as an analytical tool and, therefore, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under GAAP as set forth in the Company's financial statements. These limitations should be compensated for by relying primarily on the Company's GAAP results and using this non-GAAP information only as a supplement to evaluate the Company's performance. 

The Company considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes. Because GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Company believes that there are no comparable GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess the Company's capital adequacy using these ratios, the Company believes they are useful to provide investors the ability to assess its capital adequacy on the same basis. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures may allow readers to compare certain aspects of the Company's capitalization to other organizations. However, because there are no standardized definitions for these ratios, the Company's calculations may not be directly comparable with those of other organizations, and the usefulness of these measures to investors may be limited. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The following table includes the related GAAP measures included in our non-GAAP financial measures.

(1) CET1 is calculated under Basel III regulations. 

(2) Under the banking agencies' risk-based capital guidelines, assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet exposures are assigned to broad risk categories. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is multiplied by the associated risk weight of the category. The resulting weighted values are added together with the measure for market risk, resulting in the Company's and the Bank's total RWAs.

2020 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS 

SHUSA reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 of $487.9 million compared to net income of $874.5 million for the third quarter of 2020. The most significant period-over-period variances were: 

&#8226; a decrease in total fees and other income of $212.9 million, comprised of the mark to market on the personal unsecured portfolio HFS included in miscellaneous income, net, and lower fourth quarter gains on the sale of residual leases. Third quarter other income also included the gain on sale of SBC. 

&#8226; an increase in the income tax provision of $215.5 million primarily due to the third quarter recorded tax benefit resulting from The Company reaching 80% ownership of SC.
