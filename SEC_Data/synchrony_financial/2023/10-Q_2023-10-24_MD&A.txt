Introduction and Business Overview 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

We are a premier consumer financial services company delivering one of the industry's most complete, digitally-enabled product suites. Our experience, expertise and scale encompass a broad spectrum of industries including digital, health and wellness, retail, telecommunications, home, auto, outdoor, pet and more. We have an established and diverse group of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare service providers, which we refer to as our &#8220;partners.&#8221; For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we financed $47.0 billion and $135.8 billion of purchase volume, respectively, and had 70.3 million and 69.8 million average active accounts, respectively, and at September 30, 2023, we had $97.9 billion of loan receivables. 

We offer our credit products primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. In addition, through the Bank, we offer, directly to retail, affinity relationships and commercial customers, a range of deposit products insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), including certificates of deposit, individual retirement accounts (&#8220;IRAs&#8221;), money market accounts, savings accounts and sweep and affinity deposits. We also take deposits at the Bank through third-party securities brokerage firms that offer our FDIC-insured deposit products to their customers. We have significantly expanded our online direct banking operations in recent years and our deposit base serves as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities. At September 30, 2023, we had $78.1 billion in deposits, which represented 84% of our total funding sources. 

Our Sales Platforms 

_________________________________________________________________ 

We conduct our operations through a single business segment. Profitability and expenses, including funding costs, credit losses and operating expenses, are managed for the business as a whole. Substantially all of our revenue activities are within the United States. We primarily manage our credit products through five sales platforms (Home &#38; Auto, Digital, Diversified &#38; Value, Health &#38; Wellness and Lifestyle). Those platforms are organized by the types of partners we work with, and are measured on interest and fees on loans, loan receivables, active accounts and other sales metrics. 

Home &#38; Auto 

Our Home &#38; Auto sales platform provides comprehensive payments and financing solutions with integrated in-store and digital experiences through a broad network of partners and merchants providing home and automotive merchandise and services, as well as our Synchrony Car Care network and Synchrony HOME credit card offering. Our Home &#38; Auto sales platform partners include a wide range of key retailers in the home improvement, furniture, bedding, appliance and electronics industry, such as Ashley HomeStores LTD, Lowe's, and Mattress Firm, as well as automotive merchandise and services, such as Chevron and Discount Tire. In addition, we also have program agreements with buying groups, manufacturers and industry associations, such as Nationwide Marketing Group and the Home Furnishings Association. 

Digital 

Our Digital sales platform provides comprehensive payments and financing solutions with integrated digital experiences through partners and merchants who primarily engage with their consumers through digital channels. Our Digital sales platform includes key partners delivering digital payment solutions, such as PayPal, including our Venmo program, online marketplaces, such as Amazon and eBay, and digital-first brands and merchants, such as Verizon, the Qurate brands, and Fanatics. 

Diversified &#38; Value 

Our Diversified &#38; Value sales platform provides comprehensive payments and financing solutions with integrated in-store and digital experiences through large retail partners who deliver everyday value to consumers shopping for daily needs or important life moments. Our Diversified &#38; Value sales platform is comprised of five large retail partners: Belk, Fleet Farm, JCPenney, Sam's Club and TJX Companies, Inc. 

Health &#38; Wellness 

Our Health &#38; Wellness sales platform provides comprehensive healthcare payments and financing solutions, through a network of providers and health systems, for those seeking health and wellness care for themselves, their families and their pets, and includes key brands such as CareCredit and Pets Best, as well as partners such as Walgreens. 

Lifestyle 

Lifestyle provides comprehensive payments and financing solutions with integrated in-store and digital experiences through partners and merchants who offer merchandise in power sports, outdoor power equipment, and other industries such as sporting goods, apparel, jewelry and music. Our Lifestyle sales platform partners include a wide range of key retailers in the apparel, specialty retail, outdoor, music and luxury industry, such as 

American Eagle, Dick's Sporting Goods, Guitar Center, Sweetwater, Kawasaki, Polaris, Suzuki and Pandora. 

Corp, Other 

Corp, Other includes activity and balances related to certain program agreements with retail partners and merchants that will not be renewed beyond their current expiration date and certain programs that were previously terminated, which are not managed within the five sales platforms discussed above. Prior year activity in Corp, Other primarily includes activity associated with the Gap Inc. and BP portfolios, which were both sold in the second quarter of 2022. Corp, Other also includes amounts related to changes in the fair value of equity investments and realized gains or losses associated with the sale of investments. 

Our Credit Products 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Through our sales platforms, we offer three principal types of credit products: credit cards, commercial credit products and consumer installment loans. We also offer a debt cancellation product. 

The following table sets forth each credit product by type and indicates the percentage of our total loan receivables that are under standard terms only or pursuant to a promotional financing offer at September 30, 2023. 

Promotional Offer Credit Product Standard Terms Only Deferred Interest Other Promotional Total Credit cards 58.6 % 19.6 % 15.9 % 94.1 % Commercial credit products 1.9 &#8212; &#8212; 1.9 Consumer installment loans 0.1 0.1 3.7 3.9 Other 0.1 &#8212; &#8212; 0.1 Total 60.7 % 19.7 % 19.6 % 100.0 % 

Credit Cards 

We offer the following principal types of credit cards: 

&#8226; Private Label Credit Cards. Private label credit cards are partner-branded credit cards (e.g., Lowe&#8217;s or Amazon) or program-branded credit cards (e.g., Synchrony Car Care or CareCredit) that are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the partner or within the program network. In addition, in some cases, cardholders may be permitted to access their credit card accounts for cash advances. Credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended either on standard terms only or pursuant to a promotional financing offer. 

&#8226; Dual Cards and General Purpose Co-Branded Cards. Our patented Dual Cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to purchase goods and services from our partners, and as general purpose credit cards when used to make purchases from other retailers wherever cards from those card networks are accepted or for cash advance transactions. We also offer general purpose co-branded credit cards that do not function as private label credit cards, as well as a Synchrony-branded general purpose credit card. Dual Cards and general purpose co-branded credit cards are offered across all of our sales platforms and credit is typically extended on standard terms only. We offer either Dual Cards or general purpose co-branded credit cards through over 15 of our large partners, of which the majority are Dual Cards, as well as our CareCredit Dual Card. Consumer Dual Cards and Co-Branded cards totaled 26% of our total loan receivables portfolio at September 30, 2023. 

Commercial Credit Products 

We offer private label cards and Dual Cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings. We also offer a commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers. 

Installment Loans 

We originate secured installment loans to consumers (and a limited number of commercial customers) in the United States, primarily for power products in our Outdoor market (motorcycles, ATVs and lawn and garden). We also offer unsecured installment loans primarily in our Health and Wellness sales platform and through our various other installment products, such as our Synchrony Pay Later solutions, including pay in 4 and pay monthly options for short-term loans. Installment loans are closed-end credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments. Installment loans are generally assessed periodic finance charges using fixed interest rates. 

Business Trends and Conditions 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

We believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions. For a discussion of certain trends and conditions, see &#8220; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Business Trends and Conditions &#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K. For a discussion of how certain trends and conditions impacted the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, see &#8220;&#8212; Results of Operations. &#8221; 

Seasonality 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

We experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from August through a peak in late December, with reductions in loan receivables typically occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down. 

The seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations, delinquency metrics and the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods. 

In addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above, we also typically experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates, resulting in higher net charge-off rates in the first and second quarters. Our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status, resulting in lower net charge-off rates in the third and fourth quarters. Because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods, we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in charge-offs, as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end. Consistent with this historical experience, we generally experience a higher allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period, as compared to the end of a calendar year. In addition, even in instances of improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts, we may experience an increase in our allowance for credit losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end, reflecting these same seasonal trends. 

However, in addition to these seasonal trends, the elevated customer payment behavior we have experienced in recent years and more recently the subsequent moderation from these elevated levels, has also significantly impacted our key financial metrics and the fluctuations experienced between quarterly periods. The effects from these changes in customer payment behavior have resulted in either partial, or in some instances full, offset to the impact from the ongoing seasonal trends discussed above. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, this is most evident in our net charge-off rate which increased to 4.60% at September 30, 2023 from 3.48% at December 31, 2022 due to the impact from lower customer payment rates which exceeded the effects of the seasonal trends we experienced. 

Results of Operations 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Highlights for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Below are highlights of our performance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, as applicable, except as otherwise noted. 

&#8226; Net earnings decreased to $628 million from $703 million and to $1.8 billion from $2.4 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decreases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily driven by increases in provision for credit losses and higher interest expense, partially offset by higher interest income and lower retailer share arrangements. 

&#8226; Loan receivables increased 13.8% to $97.9 billion at September 30, 2023 compared to $86.0 billion at September 30, 2022, driven by lower customer payment rates and purchase volume growth. 

&#8226; Net interest income increased 11.0% to $4.4 billion and 8.8% to $12.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Interest and fees on loans increased 21.0% and 18.5% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily driven by growth in average loan receivables and higher benchmark rates. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was partially offset by the impact of portfolios sold in the second quarter of 2022. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, interest expense increased due to higher benchmark rates and higher funding liabilities. 

&#8226; Retailer share arrangements decreased 7.4% to $979 million and 15.4% to $2.8 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income. The decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was also due to the impact of portfolios sold in the second quarter of 2022. 

&#8226; Over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables increased 112 basis points to 4.40% at September 30, 2023. The net charge-off rate increased 160 basis points to 4.60% and increased 180 basis points to 4.62% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses increased to $1.5 billion from $929 million, and to $4.2 billion from $2.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were primarily driven by higher net charge-offs and higher reserve increases in the current year. The increases in reserves for credit losses were primarily driven by growth in loan receivables. Our allowance coverage ratio (allowance for credit losses as a percent of period-end loan receivables) decreased to 10.40% at September 30, 2023, as compared to 10.58% at September 30, 2022. 

&#8226; Other expense increased by $90 million, or 8.5%, and $256 million, or 8.0%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily driven by growth related items as well as technology investments and higher operational losses. 

&#8226; At September 30, 2023, deposits represented 84% of our total funding sources. Total deposits increased by 8.8% to $78.1 billion at September 30, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022. 

&#8226; During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we declared and paid cash dividends on our Series A 5.625% non-cumulative preferred stock of $42.18 per share, or $31 million. 

&#8226; During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased $850 million of our outstanding common stock, and declared and paid cash dividends of $0.71 per share, or $303 million. In April 2023, the Board of Directors approved an incremental share repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion, through June 30, 2024, and increased our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per common share commencing in the third quarter of 2023. At September 30, 2023 we have a total share repurchase authorization of $850 million remaining. For more information, see &#8220;Capital&#8212;Dividend and Share Repurchases.&#8221;

Interest Income 

Interest income increased by $1.0 billion, or 23.3%, and $2.7 billion, or 21.9%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily driven by increases in interest and fees on loans of 21.0% and 18.5%, respectively. The increases in interest and fees on loans were primarily driven by growth in average loan receivables and higher benchmark rates. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was partially offset by the impact of portfolios sold in the second quarter of 2022.

Average loan receivables, including held for sale, increased 14.5% and 11.7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily driven by moderation in customer payment rates and growth in purchase volume. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was partially offset by the impact from portfolios sold in the second quarter of 2022. Purchase volume increased by 5.5% and 2.7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Yield on average interest-earning assets 

The yield on average interest-earning assets increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in the yield on average loan receivables. The increases in loan receivable yield were 114 basis points to 21.24% and 118 basis points to 20.91% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense increased by $578 million to $992 million, and $1.7 billion to $2.6 billion, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily attributed to higher benchmark interest rates and higher funding liabilities. Our cost of funds increased to 4.34% and 3.95% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to 2.05% and 1.57% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively.

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income increased by $434 million, or 11.0%, and $1.0 billion, or 8.8%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, resulting from the changes in interest income and interest expense discussed above. 

Retailer Share Arrangements 

Retailer share arrangements decreased by $78 million, or 7.4%, and $505 million, or 15.4%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily due to higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income. The decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was also driven by the impact of portfolios sold in the second quarter of 2022. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses increased to $1.5 billion from $929 million, and $4.2 billion from $2.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily driven by higher net charge-offs and higher reserve increases in the current year. The increases in reserves for credit losses were primarily driven by growth in loan receivables.

Other income increased by $48 million, or 109.1%, and decreased by $132 million, or 37.7%,for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was driven primarily by higher interchange revenue and debt cancellation fees, partially offset by higher loyalty costs. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the recognition in the prior year of the gain on sale of $120 million from the portfolio sales in the second quarter of 2022. 

Other Expense 

Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, ($ in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Employee costs $ 444 $ 416 $ 1,346 $ 1,222 Professional fees 219 204 614 599 Marketing and business development 125 115 389 366 Information processing 177 150 522 458 Other 189 179 571 541 Total other expense $ 1,154 $ 1,064 $ 3,442 $ 3,186 

Other expense increased by $90 million, or 8.5% and by $256 million, or 8.0%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily driven by growth related items as well as higher technology investments and operational losses. These increases were partially offset by additional marketing and other actions taken in the prior year related to reinvestment of the gain on sale proceeds. 

Employee costs increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily attributable to an increase in headcount driven by growth and higher benefit costs. 

Professional fees and information processing costs increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increased technology investments. 

Marketing and business development costs increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to higher marketing investments in the current year to support business growth. 

Other increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher operational losses, partially offset by lower charitable contributions. 

Provision for Income Taxes

The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the benefit recorded in the prior period for favorable state tax apportionment changes. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of higher research and development credits and low income housing tax credits recorded in the current year. For both periods presented, the effective tax rate differs from the applicable U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to state income taxes.

Other income decreased by $221 million, or 101.4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the gain on sale of $120 million recognized in the prior year and lower interchange revenue related to the portfolios sold in the second quarter of 2022. 

Loan Receivables 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Loan receivables are our largest category of assets and represent our primary source of revenue. The following discussion provides supplemental information regarding our loan receivables portfolio. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policie s and Note 4. Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our loan receivables. 

The following table sets forth the composition of our loan receivables portfolio by product type at the dates indicated. 

($ in millions) At September 30, 2023 (%) At December 31, 2022 (%) Loans Credit cards $ 92,078 94.1 % $ 87,630 94.8 % Consumer installment loans 3,784 3.9 % 3,056 3.3 Commercial credit products 1,879 1.9 % 1,682 1.8 Other 132 0.1 % 102 0.1 Total loans $ 97,873 100.0 % $ 92,470 100.0 % 

Loan receivables increased 5.8% to $97.9 billion at September 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022, and increased 13.8% to $97.9 billion at September 30, 2023 compared to $86.0 billion at September 30, 2022. The increases in loan receivables were primarily driven by lower customer payment rates and purchase volume growth. The increase compared to December 31, 2022 was partially offset by the seasonality of our business. 

Our loan receivables portfolio had the following geographic concentration at September 30, 2023. 

($ in millions) Loan Receivables Outstanding % of Total Loan Receivables Outstanding State Texas $ 10,781 11.0 % California $ 10,195 10.4 % Florida $ 9,094 9.3 % New York $ 4,778 4.9 % North Carolina $ 4,035 4.1 % 

Delinquencies 

Over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables increased to 4.40% at September 30, 2023 from 3.28% at September 30, 2022, and increased from 3.65% at December 31, 2022. These increases were primarily driven by lower customer payment rates. 

Net Charge-Offs 

Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and third-party fraud losses from charge-offs. Charged-off and recovered finance charges and fees are included in interest and fees on loans while third-party fraud losses are included in other expense. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for credit losses. Costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in other expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 

The table below sets forth the net charge-offs and ratio of net charge-offs to average loan receivables, including held for sale, (&#8220;net charge-off rate&#8221;) for the periods indicated. 

Three months ended September 30, 2023 2022 ($ in millions) Amount Rate Amount Rate Credit cards $ 1,040 4.56 % $ 596 2.98 % Consumer installment loans 49 5.32 % 21 2.89 % Commercial credit products 26 5.54 % 17 3.92 % Other 1 3.08 % 1 4.96 % Total net charge-offs $ 1,116 4.60 % $ 635 3.00 % 

Nine months ended September 30, 2023 2022 ($ in millions) Amount Rate Amount Rate Credit cards $ 3,003 4.57 % $ 1,667 2.82 % Consumer installment loans 127 5.03 % 49 2.36 % Commercial credit products 87 6.50 % 43 3.58 % Other 1 1.10 % 1 1.83 % Total net charge-offs $ 3,218 4.62 % $ 1,760 2.82 % 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses totaled $10.2 billion at September 30, 2023, compared to $9.5 billion at December 31, 2022, respectively, and $9.1 billion at September 30, 2022, and reflects our estimate of expected credit losses for the life of the loan receivables on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables increased to 10.40% at September 30, 2023, from 10.30% at December 31, 2022 and decreased from 10.58% at September 30, 2022. 

The increase in allowance for credit losses compared to September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by growth in loan receivables. The increase compared to December 31, 2022 was partially offset by a $294 million reduction related to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023 which eliminated the separate recognition and measurement guidance for troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;). See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policie s and Note 4. Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the effects of adoption of the new accounting guidance. 

Funding, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

We maintain a strong focus on liquidity and capital. Our funding, liquidity and capital policies are designed to ensure that our business has the liquidity and capital resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, our credit ratings and our regulatory and policy requirements, in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments. 

Funding Sources 

Our primary funding sources include cash from operations, deposits (direct and brokered deposits), securitized financings and senior and subordinated unsecured notes.

Deposits 

We obtain deposits directly from retail, affinity relationships and commercial customers (&#8220;direct deposits&#8221;) or through third-party brokerage firms that offer our deposits to their customers (&#8220;brokered deposits&#8221;). At September 30, 2023, we had $64.1 billion in direct deposits and $14.0 billion in deposits originated through brokerage firms (including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger that channels brokerage account deposits to us). A key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to continue to utilize our direct deposit base as a source of stable and diversified low-cost funding. 

Our direct deposits are primarily from retail customers and include a range of FDIC-insured deposit products, including certificates of deposit, IRAs, money market accounts, savings accounts, sweep and affinity deposits. 

Brokered deposits are primarily from retail customers of large brokerage firms. We have relationships with 10 brokers that offer our deposits through their networks. Our brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit that bear interest at a fixed rate. These deposits generally are not subject to early withdrawal. 

Our ability to attract deposits is sensitive to, among other things, the interest rates we pay, and therefore, we bear funding risk if we fail to pay higher rates, or interest rate risk if we are required to pay higher rates, to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. To mitigate these risks, our funding strategy includes a range of deposit products, and we seek to maintain access to multiple other funding sources, including securitized financings (including our undrawn committed capacity) and unsecured debt.

(2) The standard deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, for each account ownership category. Deposits in excess of FDIC insurance limit presented above include partially insured accounts. Our estimate of the uninsured portion of these deposit balances at September 30, 2023 was approximately $5.2 billion. 

Securitized Financings 

We access the asset-backed securitization market using the Synchrony Card Issuance Trust (&#8220;SYNIT&#8221;) through which we may issue asset-backed securities through both public transactions and private transactions funded by financial institutions and commercial paper conduits. In addition, we issue asset-backed securities in private transactions through the Synchrony Credit Card Master Note Trust (&#8220;SYNCT&#8221;) and the Synchrony Sales Finance Master Trust (&#8220;SFT&#8221;). 

The following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors&#8217; interests in securitized financings, excluding debt premiums, discounts and issuance costs at September 30, 2023.

______________________ 

(1) Excludes any subordinated classes of SYNIT notes that we owned at September 30, 2023. 

We retain exposure to the performance of trust assets through: (i) in the case of SYNCT, SFT and SYNIT, subordinated retained interests in the loan receivables transferred to the trust in excess of the principal amount of the notes for a given series that provide credit enhancement for a particular series, as well as a pari passu seller&#8217;s interest in each trust and (ii) in the case of SYNIT, any subordinated classes of notes that we own. 

All of our securitized financings include early repayment triggers, referred to as early amortization events, including events related to material breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, inability or failure of the Bank to transfer loan receivables to the trusts as required under the securitization documents, failure to make required payments or deposits pursuant to the securitization documents, and certain insolvency-related events with respect to the related securitization depositor, Synchrony (solely with respect to SYNCT) or the Bank. In addition, an early amortization event will occur with respect to a series if the excess spread as it relates to a particular series or for the trust, as applicable, falls below zero. Following an early amortization event, principal collections on the loan receivables in the applicable trust are applied to repay principal of the trust's asset-backed securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund the origination activities of our business. The occurrence of an early amortization event also would limit or terminate our ability to issue future series out of the trust in which the early amortization event occurred. No early amortization event has occurred with respect to any of the securitized financings in SYNCT, SFT or SYNIT. 

The following table summarizes for each of our trusts the three-month rolling average excess spread at September 30, 2023.

______________________ 

(1) Weighted average interest rate of all senior and subordinated unsecured notes at September 30, 2023 was 4.69%. 

(2) The amounts shown exclude unamortized debt discounts, premiums and issuance costs. 

Short-Term Borrowings 

Except as described above, there were no material short-term borrowings for the periods presented. 

Other 

At September 30, 2023, we had more than $25.0 billion of unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the Federal Reserve Board for credit at the discount window. 

Covenants 

The indenture pursuant to which our senior and subordinated unsecured notes have been issued includes various covenants. If we do not satisfy any of these covenants, the maturity of amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become payable. We were in compliance with all of these covenants at September 30, 2023. 

At September 30, 2023, we were not in default under any of our credit facilities. 

Credit Ratings 

Our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of the Company, the Bank and the ratings of our asset-backed securities. 

The table below reflects our current credit ratings and outlooks: 

S&#38;P Fitch Ratings Synchrony Financial Senior unsecured debt BBB- BBB- Subordinated unsecured debt BB+ BB+ Preferred stock BB- B+ Outlook for Synchrony Financial Stable Positive Synchrony Bank Senior unsecured debt BBB BBB- Outlook for Synchrony Bank Stable Positive 

In addition, certain of the asset-backed securities issued by SYNCT and SYNIT are rated by Fitch, S&#38;P and/or Moody&#8217;s. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Downgrades in these credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets. 

Liquidity 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

We seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth, satisfy debt obligations and to meet regulatory expectations under normal and stress conditions. 

We maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business, which is the responsibility of our Asset and Liability Management Committee, a subcommittee of the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process. We evaluate a range of stress scenarios including Company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs. 

We maintain a liquidity portfolio, which at September 30, 2023 had $17.6 billion of liquid assets, primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and short-term obligations of the U.S. Treasury, less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid, compared to $14.2 billion of liquid assets at December 31, 2022. The increase in liquid assets was primarily due to deposit growth and the issuance of secured and unsecured notes, partially offset by loan receivables growth in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We believe our liquidity position at September 30, 2023 remains strong as we continue to operate in a period of uncertain economic conditions and we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity as economic conditions change. 

As additional sources of liquidity, at September 30, 2023, we had an aggregate of $2.5 billion of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings, subject to customary borrowing conditions, from private lenders under our securitization programs and $0.5 billion of undrawn committed capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility with private lenders, and we had more than $25.0 billion of unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the Federal Reserve Board for credit at the discount window. 

As a general matter, investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash. The level and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions. 

We rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the Bank for liquidity; however, bank regulations, contractual restrictions and other factors limit the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the Bank may pay to us. For a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the Bank&#8217;s ability to pay dividends, see &#8220; Regulation&#8212;Risk Factors Relating to Regulation&#8212;We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness &#8221; and &#8220; Regulation&#8212;Regulation Relating to Our Business&#8212;Savings Association Regulation&#8212;Dividends and Stock Repurchases &#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

Capital 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Our primary sources of capital have been earnings generated by our business and existing equity capital. We seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our business, meet regulatory requirements, adhere to rating agency targets and support future business growth. The level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments. Within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that will provide attractive returns to our stockholders. 

While we have not been subject to the Federal Reserve Board's formal capital plan submission requirements to-date, we submitted a capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board in 2023. While not currently required, our capital plan process does include certain internal stress testing. 

In 2023, our average total consolidated assets exceeded $100 billion and we will now become subject to existing enhanced prudential standards following applicable transition periods. We will be subject to the Federal Reserve Board's formal capital plan submission requirements in 2024 and will be required to conduct stress tests beginning in 2026. See &#8220; Regulation&#8212;Regulation Relating to Our Business&#8212;Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments &#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on regulations that are currently applicable to us, as well as these enhanced prudential standards.

Repurchases under this program are subject to market conditions and other factors, including legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals, if any. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased $850 million of common stock as part of our share repurchase programs, with remaining authorized share repurchase capacity of $850 million through June 2024. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony Financial 

As a savings and loan holding company, we are required to maintain minimum capital ratios, under the applicable U.S. Basel III capital rules. For more information, see &#8220; Regulation&#8212;Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation &#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

For Synchrony Financial to be a well-capitalized savings and loan holding company, Synchrony Bank must be well-capitalized and Synchrony Financial must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve Board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. At September 30, 2023, Synchrony Financial met all the requirements to be deemed well-capitalized. 

The following table sets forth the composition of our capital ratios for the Company calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach rules at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Basel III &#160; At September 30, 2023 At December 31, 2022 ($ in millions) Amount Ratio (1) 

Amount Ratio (1) 

Total risk-based capital $ 14,964 15.3 % $ 13,713 15.0 % Tier 1 risk-based capital $ 12,906 13.2 % $ 12,493 13.6 % Tier 1 leverage $ 12,906 11.8 % $ 12,493 12.3 % Common equity Tier 1 capital $ 12,172 12.4 % $ 11,759 12.8 % Risk-weighted assets $ 97,987 $ 91,596 

______________________ 

(1) Tier 1 leverage ratio represents total Tier 1 capital as a percentage of total average assets, after certain adjustments. All other ratios presented above represent the applicable capital measure as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. 

The Company elected to adopt the option provided by the interim final rule issued by joint federal bank regulatory agencies, which largely delayed the effects of CECL on our regulatory capital. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, the effects are being phased-in over a three-year transitional period through 2024, collectively the &#8220;CECL regulatory capital transition adjustment&#8221;. The effects of CECL on our regulatory capital will be fully phased-in beginning in the first quarter of 2025. For more information, see &#8220; Capital&#8212;Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony Financial &#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

Capital amounts and ratios in the above table all reflect the applicable CECL regulatory capital transition adjustment for each period. The decrease in our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio compared to December 31, 2022 was primarily due to an increase in risk-weighted assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the second year phase-in of the impact of CECL on our regulatory capital, partially offset by the retention of net earnings during the same period and the impact from the adoption of the new accounting standard for TDRs. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policie s for additional information on the new accounting standard. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony Bank 

At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Bank met all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized pursuant to OCC regulations and for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The following table sets forth the composition of the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach rules at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and also reflects the applicable CECL regulatory capital transition adjustment for each period. 

&#160; At September 30, 2023 At December 31, 2022 Minimum to be Well-Capitalized under Prompt Corrective Action Provisions ($ in millions) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Ratio Total risk-based capital $ 14,401 15.6 % $ 13,313 15.6 % 10.0% Tier 1 risk-based capital $ 12,408 13.4 % $ 12,174 14.2 % 8.0% Tier 1 leverage $ 12,408 12.1 % $ 12,174 12.8 % 5.0% Common equity Tier 1 capital $ 12,408 13.4 % $ 12,174 14.2 % 6.5% 

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See &#8220; Regulation&#8212;Risk Factors Relating to Regulation&#8212;Failure by Synchrony and the Bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us &#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Unfunded Lending Commitments 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees of third-party obligations. Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make a guaranteed payment or perform an obligation to a third-party based on certain trigger events. At September 30, 2023, we had not recorded any contingent liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position related to any guarantees. See Note 5 - Variable Interest Entities to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on our investment commitments for unconsolidated variable interest entities (&#8220;VIE's&#8221;). 

We extend credit, primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on our credit cards, in the ordinary course of business. Each unused credit card line is unconditionally cancellable by us. See Note 4 - Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on our unfunded lending commitments. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we have identified certain accounting estimates and assumptions that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. The critical accounting estimates we have identified relate to allowance for credit losses and fair value measurements. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change, which may result in incremental losses on loan receivables, or material changes to our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, among other effects. See &#8220; Management's Discussion and Analysis&#8212;Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K, for a detailed discussion of these critical accounting estimates. 

Regulation and Supervision 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Our business, including our relationships with our customers, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending and collection practices, treatment of our customers, safeguarding deposits, customer privacy and information security, capital structure, liquidity, dividends and other capital distributions, transactions with affiliates, and conduct and qualifications of personnel. Such laws and regulations directly and indirectly affect key drivers of our profitability, including, for example, capital and liquidity, product offerings, risk management, and costs of compliance. 

As a savings and loan holding company and a financial holding company, Synchrony is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. As a large provider of consumer financial services, we are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB. 

The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, which is its primary regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the FDIC. 

In 2023, our average total consolidated assets exceeded $100 billion and we will now become subject to existing enhanced prudential standards following applicable transition periods. See &#8220; Regulation&#8212;Regulation Relating to Our Business&#8212;Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments &#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on regulations that are currently applicable to us, as well as these enhanced prudential standards. See also &#8220; &#8212;Capital &#8221; above, for discussion of the impact of regulations and supervision on our capital and liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock. 

In July 2023, the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would change the regulatory capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations with at least $100 billion in total assets. We are currently assessing the impact of the proposed rule to our business. However, to the extent the proposed changes are finalized and adopted, they would likely increase our regulatory capital requirements, which may decrease our return on equity and could result in limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock. 

Additionally, the federal banking agencies have recently released several proposals intended to facilitate the orderly resolution of large banking organizations. For instance, an August 2023 interagency notice of proposed rulemaking would require depository institution holding companies with $100 billion or more in assets to issue minimum amounts of long-term debt and to maintain &#8220;clean&#8221; holding companies without certain types of liabilities, and, relatedly, would require insured depository institution subsidiaries with $100 billion or more in assets to issue minimum amounts of long-term debt to a holding company. While we are assessing the impact of the proposed rule to our business, if the proposed changes are finalized and adopted, they may require changes to our funding strategy and/or increase our cost of funding.
