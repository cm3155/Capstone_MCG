Executive Overview 

##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END

HSBC USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America Holdings Inc. ("HSBC North America"), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC. HUSI may also be referred to in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&#38;A") as "we," "us" or "our." 

2023 Economic Environment &#160; The U.S. economy continued to grow during 2023 despite continued pressures from high inflation and rising interest rates, which are expected to lead to a slowdown of future economic growth. In addition, bank failures earlier in the year have raised concerns about potential weakness in the banking sector, which has contributed to tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, further weighing on economic activity. U.S. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") grew at an estimated annual rate of 2.5 percent in 2023, while the personal consumption expenditures price index fell to 2.6 percent in December 2023, slightly above the FRB's target inflation rate. After increasing short-term interest rates by a total of 100 basis points during the first seven months of 2023, the FRB held short-term interest rates steady for the remainder of the year as inflation slowed. While interest rates are expected to remain elevated for some time, the FRB is expected to start decreasing short-term interest rates in 2024, the timing of which is dependent upon future economic conditions. 

Although economic conditions improved during 2023 driven by better than expected economic growth, economic uncertainty remains due to elevated interest rates, inflation levels and the expectation for slowing economic growth, all of which will continue to impact our business in future periods. Concerns over domestic and global policy issues, trade policy in the U.S. and geopolitical events, including the recent turmoil in the Middle East, as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general, further add to the global uncertainty. There is also a risk that interest rate increases to fight inflation could lead to a recession. Interest rate levels, inflation and economic growth, in combination with global economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in 2024 and beyond. 

2023 Events 

&#8226; Regional bank failures earlier in 2023 triggered turmoil throughout the banking industry as contagion fears spread. We did not experience any significant impact to our liquidity, deposits or funding capabilities as a result of this industry turmoil. In November 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") issued a final rule that imposes a special assessment on certain FDIC-insured banks, including HSBC Bank USA, to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising from the protection of uninsured depositors following a determination of systemic risk in connection with the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The special assessment is based on an insured depository institution's estimated uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022 and will be assessed over eight quarterly periods beginning with the first quarter of 2024. The special assessment results in $243 million of additional deposit insurance assessment fees for HUSI, which were accrued in the fourth quarter of 2023. Because the estimated loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund will be periodically adjusted as actual losses are incurred, the FDIC retains the ability to cease collection early or extend the special assessment collection period, as needed. 

&#8226; In September 2023, our Markets and Securities Services business segment entered into an agreement to refer transactions related to all future precious metals trading and financing activities associated with our Global Banking clients to HSBC Bank plc. We continue to provide sales and trading services to HSBC Bank plc in support of these activities, which allows us to record sales commissions and performance fees for such activities while holding fewer assets on our balance sheet. As the transfer was between affiliates under common control, the consideration received in excess of our carrying value resulted in an increase to additional paid-in-capital. In conjunction with the agreement, during the third quarter of 2023, we also transferred a portion of our precious metals trading assets inventory with a fair value of approximately $0.9 billion to HSBC Bank plc. 

&#8226; During the fourth quarter of 2023, we sold a portfolio of commercial real estate loans to a third-party sponsored asset-backed financing entity with a carrying value of $439 million at the time of sale and recognized an immaterial loss on sale, including transaction costs. These commercial real estate loans were transferred to held for sale during the second quarter of 2023 as part of an effort to reduce exposure to this sector. Prior to the sale, during 2023, we recorded $30 million of lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments associated with the write-down of these commercial loans held for sale. See Note 9, "Loans Held for Sale," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

&#8226; During the fourth quarter of 2023, we also sold certain U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities classified as available-for-sale with a total carrying value of $960 million and realized a loss of $246 million. These securities were sold to manage our exposure to the changing interest rate environment as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. We have reinvested the proceeds into higher yielding U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities classified as held-to-maturity. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

&#8226; In November 2023, we commenced a new 20-year operating lease to relocate our U.S. headquarters to 66 Hudson Boulevard, New York, New York which resulted in the recognition of a lease ROU asset of $381 million, including prepaid construction costs, and a corresponding operating lease liability of $324 million. The lease contains certain renewal and termination options. 

&#8226; In 2023, we paid dividends on our common stock of $1.5 billion from retained earnings to HSBC North America.

Net income was $393 million during 2023 compared with $548 million and $688 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. Income before income tax was $488 million during 2023 compared with $725 million and $912 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in income before income tax during 2023 compared to 2022 was due primarily to lower net interest income as interest expense on deposits and interest bearing liabilities grew faster than interest income on loans and interest bearing assets. Also contributing to the decrease were higher operating expenses due to higher deposit insurance assessment fees driven by the special assessment which was accrued in the fourth quarter of 2023 as discussed above, partially offset by lower costs driven by the completion of our strategic plan to restructure our operations ("Restructuring Plan") in 2022. See Note 3, "Strategic Initiatives," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion. These decreases were partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses and higher other revenues. The increase in other revenues was driven by 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

higher trading revenue, partially offset by the loss realized in the fourth quarter of 2023 from the sale of certain securities for risk management purposes as discussed above and the non-recurrence of a gain of $113 million recorded in 2022 on the sale of the branch disposal group associated with the exit of our mass market retail banking business. 

The decrease in income before income tax during 2022 compared to 2021 was due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses which reflected a loss provision in 2022 driven by the weakening of economic conditions compared with a release in credit loss reserves in 2021 driven by improved economic conditions and, to a lesser extent, the impact of our decision to exit our mass market retail banking business which resulted in a release of credit loss reserves and a reduction to the provision for credit losses of approximately $101 million during the second quarter of 2021. Also contributing to the decrease was lower net interest income as interest expense on deposits and interest bearing liabilities grew faster than interest income on loans and interest bearing assets. These decreases were partially offset by higher other revenues driven by higher trading revenue and the gain on sale of the branch disposal group as discussed above as well as lower operating expenses. 

See "Results of Operations" for a more detailed discussion of our operating trends. In addition, see "Balance Sheet Review" for further discussion on our asset and liability trends, "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further discussion on funding and capital and "Credit Quality" for additional discussion on our credit trends. 

London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") Transition In 2021, the United Kingdom ("U.K.") Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") announced that all LIBOR tenors would either cease to be provided by any administrator or become no longer representative immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar ("USD") LIBOR tenors and all non-USD LIBOR tenors, and immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and twelve-month USD LIBOR tenors. 

Regulators and central banks in various national jurisdictions have been working to help transition from interbank offered rates ("IBORs") to acceptable alternative rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). We had contracts that referenced IBORs, primarily USD LIBOR-based contracts for loans, derivatives and long-term debt. All of our LIBOR-based contracts have been successfully transitioned onto replacement rates or included appropriate fallback provisions upon cessation. 

Separately, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("ISDA") confirmed that the fallback spread adjustments to be used in its ISDA fallbacks were fixed as of the date of the 2021 FCA announcement. As a result, the ISDA fallbacks (i.e., to the adjusted risk-free rate plus the fixed spread adjustment) automatically occurred for outstanding derivative contracts that incorporated the ISDA fallback language or adhered to the ISDA fallback protocol generally when each LIBOR tenor ceased or became non-representative. For all outstanding derivatives referenced to USD LIBOR tenors, the ISDA fallback occurred at the first reset subsequent to June 30, 2023. 

Future Prospects Our operations are dependent upon our ability to grow revenues, maintain stable deposit balances and, to a lesser extent, access the global capital markets. Numerous factors, both internal and external, may impact our access to, and the costs associated with, both retail and wholesale sources of funding. These factors may include our debt ratings, overall economic conditions, overall capital markets volatility, the counterparty credit limits of investors to the HSBC Group, and our management of the credit risks inherent in our business and customer base. 

Our results are also impacted by general global and domestic economic conditions, including employment levels, housing market conditions, property valuations, interest rates and legislative and regulatory changes, all of which are beyond our control. Changes in interest rates generally affect both the rates we charge to our customers and the rates we pay on our borrowings. Achieving our profitability goals in 2024 is largely dependent upon macroeconomic conditions which include the interest rate environment, housing market conditions, unemployment levels, market volatility, energy prices and our ability to attract and retain loans and deposits from customers, all of which could impact trading and other revenue, net interest income, loan volume, loss provision and ultimately our results of operations. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

Basis of Reporting 

##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). 

Group Reporting Basis We report financial information to HSBC in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as issued by the IASB. As a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of HSBC Group's accounting and reporting policies ("Group Reporting Basis"). Because operating results on the Group Reporting Basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees, our management also separately monitors profit before tax under this basis of reporting. The following table reconciles our U.S. GAAP versus Group Reporting Basis profit before tax: 

##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 &#160; (in millions) Profit before tax &#8211; U.S. GAAP basis $ 488 &#160; $ 725 $ 912 Adjustments: Other long-lived assets 202 &#160; (8) 61 Renewable energy tax credit investments 12 &#160; 25 21 Gain on transfer of precious metals trading client relationships to an affiliate 10 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; Pension and other postretirement benefit costs &#8212; &#160; 6 (10) Loans held for sale (5) 25 (62) Expected credit losses (45) 153 (272) Other (4) (1) (9) Profit before tax &#8211; Group Reporting Basis $ 658 &#160; $ 925 $ 641 ##TABLE_END

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 25, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for 2023 and 2022 are explained below. See "Basis of Reporting" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 ("2022 Form 10-K") for an explanation of the differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for 2021. 

During 2023, other long-lived assets in the table above reflects a reversal of $149 million of impairment charges under the Group Reporting Basis related to capitalized software and leasehold improvements primarily associated with our Wealth and Personal Banking business segment which were previously written-off. In 2020, we recorded an impairment charge under the Group Reporting Basis related to the write-off of all the capitalized software and a portion of the leasehold improvements, while under U.S. GAAP no impairment charge was required. Subsequent to recognition of the impairment charge in 2020, expenditures for software development and newly completed leasehold improvements in our Wealth and Personal Banking business segment were capitalized and amortized over their useful lives under U.S. GAAP, but not under the Group Reporting Basis. Consequently, the carrying amounts of capitalized software and leasehold improvements were higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis and, as a result, corresponding amortization expense was higher under U.S. GAAP. During the second quarter of 2023, we determined that the cash generating unit was no longer impaired under the Group Reporting Basis and that its estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value, which resulted in the re-establishment of these assets at their recoverable amount net of amortization that would have been recorded had no impairment loss been recognized and excluding any assets that have since been sold. In addition, during 2023, we recorded $22 million of lease related impairment charges under U.S. GAAP primarily associated with the exit of certain office space, while under the Group Reporting Basis, impairment was recognized when we committed to vacate the space in the fourth quarter of 2022. 

During 2023 and 2022, renewable energy tax credit investments in the table above primarily reflects the impact of a presentation difference. Under the Group Reporting Basis, the amortization of our investment balance is presented in income tax expense, while under U.S. GAAP, the amortization of our investment balance is presented in other revenues. 

During 2023, we transferred certain precious metals trading client relationships to an affiliate which under the Group Reporting Basis required the gain to be recorded in earnings. Under U.S. GAAP, since the transfer was between affiliates under common control, the gain was reflected as a capital transaction and recorded in common equity as a component of additional paid-in capital. See Note 25, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. 

During 2022, loans held for sale in the table above reflects a higher gain on loan sales under the Group Reporting Basis than under U.S. GAAP, which includes the gain on sale of the branch disposal group. The higher gain under the Group Reporting Basis was due primarily to the releases of credit loss reserves previously recorded on the loans under U.S. GAAP when they 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

were transferred to held for sale in 2021 as well as the higher carrying amount of leasehold improvements associated with the sold branches under U.S. GAAP at the time of sale. These leasehold improvements were previously determined to be impaired and written-off under the Group Reporting Basis as discussed above. Also contributing to the higher gain under the Group Reporting Basis was the sale of certain previously charged-off credit card and other consumer loans which resulted in a recovery under the Group Reporting Basis in 2022. This transaction did not qualify as a sale under U.S. GAAP and, as a result, the recovery is being deferred and amortized over the estimated collection period. 

During 2023, expected credit losses were lower under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis. Under the Group Reporting Basis, a majority of our loans are considered to be in "stage 1" (which requires a 12-month expected credit losses ("ECL") estimate), while under U.S. GAAP such loans require a lifetime ECL estimate. Primarily as a result of the different requirements, the impact of improved economic forecasts was more pronounced under U.S. GAAP. In addition, expected credit losses under the Group Reporting Basis reflect higher provisions associated with certain loans which were downgraded to "stage 3," while under U.S. GAAP, the impact of the downgrades was covered by existing reserves. 

During 2022, expected credit losses were higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis. Primarily as a result of the different requirements related to stage 1 loans discussed above, loss provisions driven by the weakening of economic conditions, which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts as well as higher provisions associated with loan growth and maturity extensions, were more pronounced under U.S. GAAP. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the United States. We believe our policies are appropriate and fairly present the financial position and results of operations of HUSI. 

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are more fully described in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Certain accounting policies affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are complex and involve significant judgments by our management, including the use of estimates and assumptions. As a result, changes in estimates, assumptions or operational policies could significantly affect our financial position and our results of operations. We base our accounting estimates on historical experience, observable market data, inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means and on various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate, including assumptions based on unobservable inputs. To the extent we use models to assist us in measuring the fair value of particular assets or liabilities, we strive to use models that are consistent with those used by other market participants. Actual results may differ from these estimates due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. The impact of estimates and assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance may be material. 

Of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, the items discussed below involve what we have identified as critical accounting estimates based on the associated degree of judgment and complexity. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates as well as the associated assumptions and accompanying disclosure with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 

Allowance for Credit Losses &#160; Because we lend money to others, we are exposed to the risk that borrowers may not repay amounts owed to us when contractually due. Consequently, we maintain an allowance for credit losses that reflects our estimate of lifetime ECL for loans and other financial assets measured at amortized cost. Allowance for credit loss estimates are reviewed periodically and adjustments are recognized in the provision for credit losses during the period they become known. Our Risk and Finance departments share responsibility for establishing appropriate levels of allowances for credit losses inherent in our various loan and other portfolios carried at amortized cost, including debt securities, and they assess and independently approve our allowance for credit losses. See Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies and methodologies for establishing the allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures. 

The accounting estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses are "critical accounting estimates" for the following reasons: 

&#8226; Changes in the provision for credit losses can materially affect our financial results; 

&#8226; Estimates related to the allowance for credit losses require us to project future borrower performance, including cash flows, delinquencies and charge-offs, along with, when applicable, collateral values, based on a reasonable and supportable forecast period utilizing forward-looking economic scenarios in order to estimate probability of default and loss given default; 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

&#8226; Credit losses are influenced by factors outside of our control such as industry and business trends, geopolitical events and the effects of laws and regulations as well as economic conditions such as trends in housing prices, interest rates, GDP, inflation, energy prices and unemployment; and 

&#8226; Judgment is required to determine whether the models used to generate the allowance for credit losses produce an estimate that is sufficient to encompass the current view of lifetime ECL. 

Because our estimates of the allowance for credit losses involve judgment and are influenced by factors outside of our control, there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates. Changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance and provision for credit losses. Our reported combined estimated allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures ranged from $701 million to $748 million during 2023. 

As discussed further in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we utilize a minimum of four forward-looking economic scenarios to estimate lifetime ECL, including three consensus economic scenarios and a fourth scenario, referred to as the "Alternative Downside scenario," which is designed to consider severe downside risks with more extreme economic outcomes. Each scenario is assigned a weighting based upon management's assessment of the likelihood of occurrence. 

As an illustration of the effect of changes in estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses, using a 100 percent weighting for the Alternative Downside scenario instead of using the four weighted scenarios at December 31, 2023 would have resulted in a combined increase to our allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures of approximately $380 million. This illustration only represents the effect of changes in the weighting of these scenarios on our existing modeled portfolios and does not consider changes in the allowance related to management judgment that might occur. 

Our allowance for credit losses is based on estimates and is intended to be adequate but not excessive. The allowance for credit losses is regularly assessed for adequacy. The allowance for credit losses, which is carried as a reduction to the respective assets on the balance sheet, includes reserves for lifetime ECL associated with loans and other financial assets carried at amortized cost. A reserve is also maintained for off-balance sheet risk, which is recorded in other liabilities and includes lifetime ECL arising from off-balance sheet arrangements such as letters of credit and undrawn commitments to lend. 

The allowances include amounts calculated for individual loan balances and for collective loan portfolios depending on the nature of the exposure and the manner in which risks inherent in that exposure are managed. In addition, the allowance for credit losses on consumer and commercial loans reflects management judgment of risk factors that may not be fully reflected in the lifetime ECL generated by our models. In making this determination, we consider the characteristics of our portfolio and any other significant factors that are relevant. Management review committees, comprising representatives from Credit Risk and Finance, have been established in order to review and challenge the results of the lifetime ECL calculations before approving them each period. The committees also consider other observable factors, both internal and external to us in the general economy, to ensure that the estimates provided by the various models adequately include all known information at each reporting period. 

Valuation of Financial Instruments A significant portion of our financial assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. These include trading assets and liabilities, derivatives, securities available-for-sale and equity securities. Furthermore, we have elected to measure specific assets and liabilities at fair value under the fair value option, including certain commercial loans held for sale, certain student loans, structured deposits, structured notes, certain of our own debt issuances and certain client share repurchase transactions. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, we use quoted prices to determine fair value. If quoted prices are not available, we base fair value on models using inputs that are either directly observable or are derived from and corroborated by market data. 

Valuation of Major Classes of Assets and Liabilities - Fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the "Fair Value Framework"). The Fair Value Framework establishes a three-tiered fair value hierarchy as discussed further in Note 29, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest hierarchical level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. As such, the classification of a financial asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is dynamic in that the asset or liability could be transferred to other hierarchy levels in each reporting period as a result of price discovery. We review and update our fair value hierarchy classifications quarterly. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of the inputs into a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification between hierarchy levels. Level 3 assets as a percentage of total assets measured at fair value were approximately 1.1 percent and 0.5 percent at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs can impact the amount of revenue, expense or other comprehensive income recorded for a particular financial instrument. While we believe our valuation methods are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities could result in a 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

different estimate of fair value at the reporting date, which can result in equity and earnings volatility. For example, a 10 percent adverse change in the value of our level 3 assets (excluding derivatives) would have reduced their carrying value by approximately $53 million at December 31, 2023. For additional discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, see Note 29, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The following is a description of the methodologies used in the valuation of significant financial assets and liabilities for which quoted market prices and observable market parameters are not available. 

&#8226; Derivatives - We manage groups of derivative instruments with offsetting market and credit risks. Accordingly, we measure the fair value of each group of derivative instruments based on the exit price of the group's net risk position. The fair value of a net risk position is determined using internal models that utilize multiple valuation inputs. The majority of the valuation inputs can be validated through market consensus data. For complex or long-dated derivative products where market data is not available, fair value is sensitive to the limitation of the valuation model (model risk), the liquidity of the product (liquidity risk), the funding of the product (funding risk) and the assumptions about inputs not obtainable through price discovery process (data uncertainty risk). Accordingly, we make valuation adjustments to capture these risks and uncertainties. Because of the interrelated nature, in most cases we do not separately make an explicit adjustment to the fair value for each of these risks. Instead, we apply a range of assumptions to the valuation input that we believe implicitly incorporates adjustments for liquidity, funding, model and data uncertainty risks. 

We also include a credit valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net derivative positions. In estimating the credit valuation adjustment, we net the derivative positions by counterparties. The fair value for a net long credit risk position is adjusted for the counterparty's credit risk referred to as credit valuation adjustment whereas the fair value for a net short credit risk position is adjusted for HUSI's own credit risk referred to as debit valuation adjustment. We calculate the credit valuation adjustment by applying the probability of default of the counterparty to the expected exposure, and multiplying the result by the expected loss given default. We estimate the implied probability of default based on the credit spread of the specific counterparty observed in the credit default swap market. Where credit default spread of the counterparty is not available, we use the credit default spread of a specific proxy (e.g., the credit default swap spread of the counterparty's parent) or a proxy based on credit default swaps referencing to credit names of similar credit standing. 

&#8226; Securities - For the substantial majority of our trading and available-for-sale securities, we obtain fair value for each security instrument from multiple independent pricing vendors ("IPV") and brokers, if available. We have established adequate controls in pricing vendor selection and fair value validation. The validation methods include but are not limited to comparisons among IPV prices for the same instrument, review and challenge of IPV valuation methodologies, inputs and assumptions, and the elapsed time between the date to which market data relates and the measurement date. For securities that are difficult to value, we use internal pricing models which estimate the fair value based on our assumptions in funding risk, default risk and loss upon default. We exercise significant judgment in estimating these assumptions and inputs to the valuation model. We believe these model inputs reflect market participants' assumptions about risks and the risk premium required to compensate for undertaking risks. 

&#8226; Structured Notes and Deposits - Structured notes and deposits are hybrid instruments containing embedded derivatives. The valuation of the hybrid instruments is predominantly driven by the derivative features embedded within the instruments and our own credit risk. Depending on the complexity of the embedded derivative, the same risk elements of valuation adjustments described in the derivative section above would also apply to hybrid instruments. In addition, cash flows for the funded notes and deposits are discounted at the relevant interest rates for the duration of the instrument adjusted for our own credit spreads. The credit spreads so applied are determined with reference to our own debt issuance rates observed in primary and secondary markets, internal funding rates and the structured note rates in recent executions. 

Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for Federal and State net operating losses. Our net deferred tax assets, including deferred tax liabilities, totaled $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We evaluate our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering negative and positive evidence, including our historical financial performance, projections of future taxable income, expectations of future corporate alternative minimum tax and any resulting credit carryforwards, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and any carryback availability. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to earnings if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income based on objective and verifiable management forecasts. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. Because the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant judgments about future earnings, the periods in which items will impact taxable income and the application of inherently complex tax laws, we have 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

identified the assessment of deferred tax assets and the need for any related valuation allowance as a critical accounting estimate. 

The use of different assumptions of future earnings, the periods in which items will impact taxable income and the application of inherently complex tax laws can result in changes in the amounts of deferred tax items recognized, which can result in equity and earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. Furthermore, if future events differ from our current forecasts, valuation allowances may need to be established or adjusted, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position. We will continue to update our assumptions and forecasts of future taxable income and assess the need and adequacy of any valuation allowance. 

Our interpretations of tax laws are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and State taxing authorities. Resolution of disputes over interpretations of tax laws may result in us being assessed additional income taxes. We regularly review whether we may be assessed such additional income taxes and recognize liabilities for such potential future tax obligations as appropriate. 

Additional detail on our assumptions with respect to the judgments made in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets and on the components of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2023 and 2022 can be found in Note 18, "Income Taxes," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Short-Term Investments Short-term investments include cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Short-term investments decreased compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to purchases of securities held-to-maturity and lower affiliate deposits. These decreases were partially offset by increases in short-term investments driven by higher short-term borrowings and long-term debt as discussed in detail below.

(3) See "Credit Quality" in this MD&#38;A for a discussion of trends in our allowance for credit losses on loans. 

Commercial loans decreased compared with December 31, 2022 due to paydowns and maturities exceeding new business activity as we continued to apply a disciplined lending approach. Also contributing to the decrease were lower loans to affiliates. The decline in commercial non-affiliate loans was primarily in the real estate, software and retailing industries, partially offset by increases in the semiconductor and utilities industries. 

Consumer loans increased compared with December 31, 2022 driven by continued growth in residential mortgage loans. 

The following table presents loan-to-value ("LTV") ratios for our residential mortgage loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans held for sale:

(1) LTVs for first liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date. LTVs for second liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date plus the senior lien amount at origination. Current estimated property values are derived from the property's appraised value at the time of loan origination updated by the change in the Federal Housing Finance Agency's House Price Index ("HPI") at either a core-based statistical area or state level. The estimated value of the homes could differ from actual fair values due to changes in condition of the underlying property, variations in housing price changes within metropolitan statistical areas and other factors. As a result, actual property values associated with loans that end in foreclosure may be significantly lower than the estimates used for purposes of this disclosure. 

(2) Current estimated property values are calculated using the most current HPIs available and applied on an individual loan basis, which results in an approximate three month delay in the production of reportable statistics. Therefore, the information in the table above reflects current estimated property values using HPIs at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Commercial loans held for sale decreased compared with December 31, 2022. Included in commercial loans held for sale are certain loans that we no longer intend to hold for investment and were transferred to held for sale which totaled $89 million and $112 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease compared with December 31, 2022 was due primarily to loan sales. 

Commercial loans held for sale also includes certain loans that we have elected to designate under the fair value option which consists of loans that we originate in connection with our participation in a number of syndicated credit facilities with the intent of selling them to unaffiliated third parties as well as loans that we purchase from the secondary market and hold as hedges against our exposure to certain total return swaps or intend to sell. The fair value of these loans totaled $250 million and $237 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. 

During the fourth quarter of 2023, we sold a portfolio of commercial real estate loans to a third-party sponsored asset-backed financing entity with a carrying value of $439 million at the time of sale and recognized an immaterial loss on sale, including transaction costs. These commercial real estate loans were transferred to held for sale during the second quarter of 2023 as part of an effort to reduce exposure to this sector. In connection with the sale, we provided a loan to the third-party buyer sponsored asset-backed financing entity for a portion of the purchase price. 

Consumer loans held for sale decreased compared with December 31, 2022. Included in residential mortgage loans held for sale are agency-eligible conforming residential mortgage loans which are originated and held for sale to third parties, currently on a servicing retained basis. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. Gains and losses from the sale of these residential mortgage loans are reflected as a component of other income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated statement of income. 

Excluding the loans designated under the fair value option discussed above, loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, with adjustments to fair value being recorded as a valuation allowance through other revenues. The valuation allowance on commercial loans held for sale was $2 million and nil at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The valuation allowance on consumer loans held for sale was nil at both December 31, 2023 and 2022.

(1) See Note 5, "Trading Assets and Liabilities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a breakout of trading securities by category. 

Trading securities balances were higher compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to increases in equity and U.S. Treasury positions, partially offset by a decrease in foreign sovereign positions. Trading security positions are primarily held as economic hedges of interest rate, credit and equity derivative products issued to clients of domestic and emerging markets. Balances of securities sold, not yet purchased were also higher compared with December 31, 2022 due to an increase in short U.S. Treasury positions related to economic hedges of trading security positions held for Community Reinvestment Act purposes. 

Precious metals trading assets were lower compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to declines in our own gold and silver inventory positions driven by lower balance sheet deployment and the transfer of a portion of our precious metals inventory with a fair value of approximately $0.9 billion to HSBC Bank plc during the third quarter of 2023. Payables for precious metals were higher compared with December 31, 2022 reflecting an increase in borrowing of gold and silver inventory to support client activity levels. Precious metal positions may not represent our net underlying exposure as we may use derivatives contracts to reduce our risk associated with these positions, the fair value of which would appear in derivatives in the table above. 

Derivative asset and liability balances both decreased compared with December 31, 2022 mainly from market movements which resulted in lower valuations of foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity derivatives. Market movements on equity derivatives were mixed, resulting in lower asset valuations, but higher liability valuations. 

Securities Securities include securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity, net. Securities balances were higher compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to purchases of U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities held-to-maturity, partially offset by sales, paydowns and maturities of U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities available-for-sale as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. Also contributing to the increase were purchases of foreign sovereign securities available-for-sale. 

All Other Assets &#160; All other assets include, among other items, properties and equipment, net, and goodwill. All other assets were lower compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to decreases in assets associated with client share repurchase transactions, cash collateral posted and deferred tax assets. These decreases were partially offset by higher lease assets as discussed below as well as increases in accrued interest receivables and prepaid expenses. In November 2023, we commenced a new 20-year operating lease to relocate our U.S. headquarters which resulted in the recognition of a lease ROU asset of $381 million, including prepaid construction costs, and a corresponding operating lease liability of $324 million.

Total deposits decreased compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to the attrition of retail savings and demand deposits driven by the competitive rate environment and clients seeking higher return investments. Also contributing to the decrease were lower deposits from affiliates as well as lower deposits from a few large private banking clients. These decreases were partially offset by increased time deposits. 

Short-Term Borrowings &#160; Short-term borrowings were higher compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to an increase in federal funds purchased resulting from the management of our short-term funding positions. Also contributing to the increase, to a lesser extent, was higher commercial paper outstanding. We continue to actively manage our balance sheet to maximize returns while maintaining adequate liquidity. 

Long-Term Debt Long-term debt increased compared with December 31, 2022 due to debt issuances, including $500 million of senior debt issued to HSBC North America during the fourth quarter of 2023, and fair value movements on fair value option debt, partially offset by debt retirements. Debt issuances during 2023 totaled $4,557 million, of which $7 million was issued by HSBC Bank USA. 

Incremental issuances from our shelf registration statement with the SEC totaled $4,050 million of senior debt during 2023, which included $1,250 million of senior notes that were issued by HSBC USA in March as well as $2,800 million of structured notes. Total long-term debt outstanding under this shelf was $9,227 million and $9,597 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Incremental issuances from the HSBC Bank USA Global Bank Note Program totaled $7 million during 2023. Total debt outstanding under this program was $1,918 million and $1,932 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") totaled $1,000 million at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Interest, Taxes and Other Liabilities Interest, taxes and other liabilities increased compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to higher lease liabilities reflecting the new 20-year operating lease to relocate our U.S. headquarters as discussed further above and higher accrued deposit insurance assessment fees driven by $243 million of special assessment fees which were accrued in the fourth quarter of 2023 associated with a final rule issued by the FDIC in November. Also contributing to the increase were higher accrued interest payables. These increases were partially offset by lower liabilities associated with client share repurchase transactions. 

Total Equity Total equity decreased compared with December 31, 2022 due to dividends paid on our common stock of $1.5 billion from retained earnings to HSBC North America during 2023. See Note 26, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional details.

Net Interest Income Net interest income is the total interest income on earning assets less the total interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds. An analysis of consolidated average balances and interest rates is presented in this MD&#38;A under the caption "Consolidated Average Balances and Interest Rates."

(1) Represents the benefit associated with interest earning assets in excess of interest bearing liabilities. Increased percentages reflect growth in this excess or a higher cost of interest bearing liabilities, while decreased percentages reflect a reduction in this excess or a lower cost of interest bearing liabilities. 

Net interest income decreased during 2023 due to higher interest expense from interest bearing liabilities driven by higher rates paid and higher average balances primarily long-term debt, partially offset by higher interest income from interest earning assets driven by higher yields. Also contributing to the decrease was the unfavorable impact of lower short-term investment and commercial loan average balances. 

Higher yields on interest earning assets and higher rates paid on interest bearing liabilities reflect the impact of higher market rates. 

Short-term investments Interest income increased during 2023 due primarily to higher yields and, to a lesser extent, a shift in mix to higher yielding securities purchased under resale agreements. These increases were partially offset by lower average balances driven by a decline in deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank. 

Trading securities Interest income increased during 2023 due to higher yields and higher average balances. Higher average balances were driven by increases in U.S. Treasury and foreign sovereign positions. Interest income associated with trading securities was partially offset within trading revenue by the performance of the associated derivatives as discussed further below. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

Securities Interest income was higher during 2023 due primarily to higher yields. Also contributing to the increase were higher average balances driven by an increase in U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by a decline in U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. 

Commercial loans Interest income increased during 2023 due to higher yields on variable rate loans and newly originated loans, partially offset by lower average balances. 

Consumer loans Interest income was higher during 2023 due primarily to higher yields on variable rate loans and newly originated loans. Also contributing to the increase were higher average balances driven by growth in residential mortgage loans. 

Other Higher interest income during 2023 was due primarily to higher yields on cash collateral posted, partially offset by lower average balances. 

Deposits Interest expense increased during 2023 due primarily to higher rates paid and, to a lesser extent, a shift in mix to higher cost time deposits. 

Short-term borrowings Higher interest expense during 2023 was due primarily to higher rates paid and, to a lesser extent, higher average balances driven by increases in commercial paper outstanding and federal funds purchased. 

Long-term debt Interest expense increased during 2023 due primarily to higher rates paid on variable rate borrowings and newly issued debt. Also contributing to the increase, to a lesser extent, were higher average balances. 

Tax liabilities and other Interest expense increased during 2023 due primarily to higher rates paid on securities sold, not yet repurchased. 

Provision for Credit Losses The following table summarizes the components of the provision for credit losses:

Our provision for credit losses decreased $109 million during 2023 due to a lower provision for credit losses on both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios as well as a lower provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures. 

The provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio in 2023 was driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures, partially offset by improved economic forecasts and a decline in credit reserves for risk associated with large loan exposures. In 2022, the provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio was driven by the weakening of economic conditions which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts and weakness in the financial condition of certain clients. Also contributing to the loss provision in 2022 were an increase in credit reserves for risk associated with large loan exposures and 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

higher provisions associated with loan growth and maturity extensions. The loss provision in 2022 was partially offset by declines in credit reserves for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures and supply chain disruptions. 

The provision for credit losses on our consumer loan portfolio decreased $7 million during 2023 reflecting a higher release in credit loss reserves. The release in credit reserves in 2023 was driven by improved housing price forecasts, partially offset by an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with a change in New York State foreclosure law as well as a modest deterioration in home equity mortgages. In 2022, the release in credit reserves was driven by the impact of net recoveries, partially offset by an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with economic uncertainty and loss provisions associated with certain mass market credit cards and other consumer loans that were transferred back to held for investment during the fourth quarter of 2022. 

The provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures decreased $20 million during 2023 reflecting a release in credit loss reserves compared with a loss provision in 2022. The release in credit reserves in 2023 resulted primarily from improved economic forecasts, while the loss provision in 2022 resulted from the weakening of economic conditions, partially offset by improvements in the credit condition of certain clients. 

Our methodology and accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses are presented under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" in this MD&#38;A and in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. See "Credit Quality" in this MD&#38;A for additional discussion on the allowance for credit losses associated with our various loan portfolios.

Credit card fees, net Credit card fees, net were higher during 2023 reflecting increases in late fees and other miscellaneous fees. 

Trust and investment management fees Trust and investment management fees decreased modestly during 2023 due to lower fees from private banking funds reflecting lower average assets under management. 

Other fees and commissions Other fees and commissions increased during 2023 due to higher fees from loan syndication, guarantees and account services reflecting higher business activity compared with 2022. These increases were partially offset by the non-recurrence of loan servicing fees recorded in 2022 reflecting the temporary servicing agreement we entered into associated with the sale of a portfolio of mass market retail credit cards during the fourth quarter of 2021. See Note 23, "Fee Income from Contracts with Customers," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a summary of the components of other fees and commissions.

Trading revenue Trading revenue is generated by participation in the foreign exchange, precious metals, rates, credit and equities markets. The following table presents trading revenue by business activity. Not included in the table below is the impact of net interest income associated with trading securities which is an integral part of trading activities' overall performance. Net interest income related to trading activities is recorded in net interest income in the consolidated statement of income. Certain derivatives, such as total return swaps, are economically hedged by holding the underlying interest bearing referenced assets. Trading revenue related to the mortgage banking business is included as a component of other income (loss).

##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END

(1) Includes trading revenue related to Global Banking and Equities. During 2021, Other trading revenue also included $35 million of trading losses associated with the exit of certain derivative contracts as part of our Restructuring Plan. 

Trading revenue increased during 2023 due primarily to higher revenue in Securities Financing, Metals and Foreign Exchange driven by the impact of higher market rates which impacts fair value. These increases were partially offset by lower Markets Treasury revenue driven by the lower performance of economic hedge positions used to manage interest rate risk. 

Other securities gains (losses), net We maintain securities portfolios as part of our balance sheet diversification and risk management strategies. During 2023 and 2022, we sold $1,642 million and $1,812 million, respectively, of primarily U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. Other securities gains (losses), net decreased during 2023 due primarily to a loss of $246 million realized in the fourth quarter of 2023 from the sale of certain U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities with a total carrying value of $960 million as we managed our exposure to the changing interest rate environment and rebalanced the portfolio for risk management purposes. Also contributing to decrease, to a lesser extent, were lower gains from the sale of U.S. Treasury securities. The gross realized gains and losses from sales of securities, which are included as a component of other securities gains (losses), net above, are summarized in Note 6, "Securities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates decreased during 2023 due primarily to lower performance fees associated with trading activity booked on the balance sheet of HSBC Bank plc, partially offset by higher loan servicing fees from HSBC Markets (USA) Inc. ("HMUS") and higher sales commissions from HSBC Bank plc. 

Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives We have elected to apply fair value option accounting to certain commercial loans held for sale, certain student loans, certain of our own fixed-rate debt issuances, all of our hybrid instruments issued, including structured notes and deposits, and certain client share repurchase transactions. We also use derivatives to economically hedge the interest rate and other risks associated with certain financial assets and liabilities for which fair value option accounting has been elected. Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives improved during 2023 attributable primarily to favorable fair value adjustments on commercial loans held for sale driven by losses in 2022 on certain loans which were impacted by the weakening of economic conditions and deterioration in the financial condition of certain clients, partially offset by unfavorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk and other risks within our hybrid instruments. See Note 17, "Fair Value Option," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a breakout of these amounts by individual component. 

Gain on sale of branch disposal group, net During 2022, we completed the sale of the branch disposal group associated with the exit of our mass market retail banking business to third parties and recognized a gain on sale of $113 million, net of transaction costs. See Note 4, "Sale of Certain Branch Assets and Liabilities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

Other income (loss) &#160; Other income (loss) improved during 2023 due primarily to higher income associated with bank owned life insurance and lower losses on loan sales. During 2022, we recorded losses of $35 million on the sale of a portfolio of consumer mortgage loans and $21 million on the sales of certain global banking loans as part of our Restructuring Plan. The loss on sale of the portfolio of consumer mortgage loans was increased by $10 million during the second quarter of 2023 reflecting a repricing reserve adjustment. These increases were partially offset by higher valuation losses associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a few client relationships and higher valuation losses on loans held for sale. 

Operating Expenses The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses:

Salaries and employee benefits Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased during 2023 due primarily to lower salaries expense and other staff costs driven by staff reductions related to the completion of our Restructuring Plan, including the sale of the branch disposal group during the first quarter of 2022. Also contributing to the decrease were lower severance costs, partially offset by higher incentive compensation costs. 

Support services from HSBC affiliates Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates decreased during 2023 due to the non-recurrence of $255 million of allocated costs recorded in 2022 related to the delivery of our Restructuring Plan from HTSU and other HSBC affiliates, primarily support service project costs and severance costs. This decrease was partially offset by higher cost allocations from our support service functions, primarily associated with global resourcing and other global support activities, as well as higher cost allocations from HMUS associated with Global Banking activities reflecting the impact of a higher utilization percentage and higher costs associated with our investments in systems infrastructure and new technologies. A summary of the services received from various HSBC affiliates is included in Note 24, "Related Party Transactions," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Occupancy expense, net Occupancy expense, net decreased during 2023 due primarily to lower operating lease costs driven by the completion of our Restructuring Plan, partially offset by higher depreciation expense. 

Other expenses Other expenses increased during 2023 due primarily to higher deposit insurance assessment fees driven by $243 million of special assessment fees which were accrued in the fourth quarter of 2023 associated with a final rule issued by the FDIC in November. This increase was partially offset by higher levels of expense capitalization related to internally developed software as well as declines in outside services expense, professional fees, expense related to legal matters and marketing expense. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

Efficiency ratio Our efficiency ratio increased during 2023 due to lower net interest income as discussed in detail above and higher operating expenses driven by higher deposit insurance assessment fees, partially offset by higher other revenues driven by higher trading revenue. 

Income tax expense Our effective tax rate was 19.5 percent in 2023 compared with 24.4 percent in 2022 and 24.6 percent in 2021.

Segment Results &#8211; Group Reporting Basis 

##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END

We have distinct businesses, which are aligned with HSBC's global business strategy: Wealth and Personal Banking ("WPB"), Commercial Banking ("CMB"), and Global Banking and Markets ("GBM"). These businesses and a Corporate Center ("CC") serve as our reportable segments with the exception of GBM. Our GBM business is comprised of three distinct operating segments: Global Banking ("GB"), Markets and Securities Services ("MSS"), and Global Banking and Markets Other ("GBM Other"), which are separately reported. See Item 1, "Business," in this Form 10-K for a description of our segments, including a discussion of the main business activities of the segments and a summary of their products and services. There have been no changes in the basis of our segmentation as compared with the presentation in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

Net interest income of each segment represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment, adjusted for a funding charge or credit that includes both interest rate and liquidity components. Segments are charged a cost to fund assets (e.g., customer loans) and receive a funding credit for funds provided (e.g., customer deposits) based on equivalent market rates that incorporate both repricing (interest rate risk) and tenor (liquidity) characteristics. The objective of these charges/credits is to transfer interest rate risk to one centralized unit in Markets Treasury. Markets Treasury income statement and balance sheet results are allocated to each of the global businesses based upon tangible equity levels and levels of any surplus liabilities. 

Certain other revenue and operating expense amounts are also apportioned among the business segments based upon the benefits derived from this activity or the relationship of this activity to other segment activity. These inter-segment transactions have not been eliminated, and we generally account for them as if they were with third parties. 

We report financial information to our parent, HSBC, in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply IFRSs as issued by the IASB. As a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the Group Reporting Basis as operating results are monitored and reviewed, trends are evaluated and decisions about allocating resources, such as employees, are primarily made on this basis. We continue, however, to monitor capital adequacy and report to regulatory agencies on a U.S. GAAP basis. 

During the second quarter of 2023, we implemented a change to our internal management reporting to report net funding charges associated with MSS trading activities within other operating income (expense) to better align with the trading revenue generated by such activities. Historically, these funding charges were reported within net interest income (expense). There was no impact to consolidated net interest income (expense) or other operating income (expense) as these net funding charges are reversed back into net interest income (expense) in the CC. As a result, we have aligned our segment reporting for MSS and CC to reflect this change for all periods presented. See Note 25, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a table that summarizes the impact of this change on reported segment net interest income (expense) and other operating income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. There have been no other changes in the measurement of segment profit as compared with the presentation in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 25, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

2022 compared with 2021 See "Segment Results - Group Reporting Basis" in our 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of our segment results for 2022 compared with 2021. See below for a discussion of our segment results for 2023 compared with 2022.

(2) Includes cost reimbursements associated with activities performed on behalf of other HSBC affiliates and allocated Markets Treasury revenue. During 2022, retail business banking and other also reflects a gain of $151 million on the sale of the branch disposal group associated with the exit of our mass market retail banking business as well as a loss on the sale of a portfolio of consumer mortgage loans as discussed below. 

Our WPB segment reported a higher profit before tax during 2023 due primarily to lower operating expenses driven by a reversal of $142 million of impairment charges recorded during the second quarter of 2023 related to capitalized software and leasehold improvements which were previously written-off. During the second quarter of 2023, we determined that the WPB cash generating unit was no longer impaired and that its estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value, which resulted in the re-establishment of these assets at their recoverable amount net of amortization that would have been recorded had no impairment loss been recognized and excluding any assets that have since been sold. This increase was partially offset by lower other operating income driven by the non-recurrence of a gain of $151 million recorded in 2022 on the sale of the branch disposal group associated with the exit of our mass market retail banking business as well as higher expected credit losses and lower net interest income. 

Net interest income decreased during 2023 due primarily to the unfavorable impact of lower deposits driven by the attrition of savings and demand deposits, partially offset by the favorable impact of higher market rates. 

Other operating income decreased during 2023 due primarily to the non-recurrence of the gain on sale of the branch disposal group as discussed above as well as lower allocated Markets Treasury revenue, largely reflecting an allocated loss of $57 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from the sale of certain securities for risk management purposes. These decreases were partially offset by lower losses on loan sales. During 2022, we recorded a loss of $55 million on the sale of a portfolio of consumer mortgage loans. The loss on sale was increased by $10 million during the second quarter of 2023 reflecting a repricing reserve adjustment. 

Expected credit losses increased during 2023 reflecting a modest loss provision compared with a release in credit loss reserves in 2022. The modest loss provision in 2023 was due primarily to a higher loss estimate for risk factors associated with a change in New York State foreclosure law. In 2022, the release in credit reserves was due primarily to a decline in unused credit card lines reflecting completion of the temporary servicing agreement we entered into associated with the sale of a portfolio of mass market retail credit cards during the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as the sale of certain previously charged-off credit card and other consumer loans which resulted in the recognition of a $9 million recovery. 

Operating expenses decreased during 2023 due primarily to the reversal of impairment charges as discussed above as well as the completion of our Restructuring Plan, including the sale of the branch disposal group during the first quarter of 2022, which resulted in declines in staff costs, operating lease costs, marketing expense and cost allocations from our technology and support service functions. Also contributing to the decrease were lower deposit insurance assessment fees and the non-recurrence of $34 million of lease impairment and other related costs recorded in 2022 primarily related to the impairment of newly completed leasehold improvements. These decreases were partially offset by higher expense related to legal matters and 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

higher amortization expense for capitalized software due to the impact of the reversal of impairment charges as discussed above.

(2) Includes allocated Markets Treasury revenue. 

Our CMB segment reported a lower profit before tax during 2023 due to lower other operating income, higher operating expenses and higher expected credit losses, partially offset by higher net interest income. 

Net interest income increased during 2023 due to higher deposit spreads reflecting the impact of higher market rates and higher earnings on capital. 

Other operating income decreased during 2023 due primarily to lower allocated Markets Treasury revenue, largely reflecting an allocated loss of $84 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from the sale of certain securities for risk management purposes, as well as a loss of $28 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023 on the sale of a portfolio of commercial real estate loans. These decreases were partially offset by higher fees from account services, commitments and guarantees. 

Expected credit losses increased during 2023. The loss provision in 2023 was driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients, partially offset by improved economic forecasts. In 2022, the loss provision was driven by the weakening of economic conditions which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts and weakness in the financial condition of certain clients as well as higher provisions associated with loan growth. The loss provision in 2022 was partially offset by a lower loss estimate for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures. 

Operating expenses increased during 2023 due primarily to higher salaries and incentive compensation expenses related to growth initiatives in innovation banking as well as higher cost allocations from our technology and support service functions.

Lower revenue in GB Other was driven by unfavorable fair value adjustments on certain credit-linked structured notes and higher valuation losses associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a few client relationships. Lower GPS revenue was due primarily to lower net interest income reflecting lower funding credits driven by an update to transfer pricing rates and lower average deposit balances. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue in Investment Banking due primarily to favorable fair value adjustments on certain loans held for sale driven by losses recorded in 2022 on certain loans which were impacted by the weakening of economic conditions and deterioration in the financial condition of certain clients. Also contributing to higher Investment Banking revenue were higher net interest income in issuer services reflecting the impact of higher market rates and higher fees from loan syndication. 

Expected credit losses decreased slightly during 2023. The loss provision in 2023 was driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients, partially offset by improved economic conditions. In 2022, the loss provision was driven by the weakening of economic conditions which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts and weakness in the financial condition of certain clients. 

Operating expenses increased during 2023 due primarily to higher cost allocations from HMUS reflecting the impact of a higher utilization percentage and higher cost allocations from our technology and support service functions.

(2) Includes a trading loss of $13 million recorded during 2021 associated with the exit of certain derivative contracts as part of our Restructuring Plan. 

Our MSS segment reported a lower profit before tax during 2023 due primarily to lower other operating income. 

Revenue decreased during 2023 due to lower revenue in Foreign Exchange and Metals, Equities and Securities Financing. Lower revenue in Foreign Exchange and Metals was due to lower client volumes in Foreign Exchange driven by lower market volatility compared with 2022 and lower balance sheet deployment in Metals. The decrease in Metals revenue was partially offset by a gain of $10 million recorded during the third quarter of 2023 on the transfer of all future precious metals trading and financing activities associated with our Global Banking clients to HSBC Bank plc. Lower revenue in Equities was driven by lower performance fees associated with trading activity booked on the balance sheet of HSBC Bank plc, while lower Securities Financing revenue was driven by spread compression. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue in Debt Markets due to higher earnings on capital and favorable credit and funding valuation adjustments attributable primarily to higher gains from credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets. 

Operating expenses decreased during 2023 due primarily to lower cost allocations from our technology and support service functions.

Our GBM Other segment reported a higher loss before tax during 2023 due to lower revenue driven by lower allocated Market Treasury revenue, largely reflecting an allocated loss of $105 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from the sale of certain securities for risk management purposes. Also contributing to lower revenue was lower allocated net interest income. This decrease was partially offset by lower operating expenses driven by lower cost allocations from our technology and support service functions and the non-recurrence of expense related to legal matters in 2022.

Our CC segment reported a lower loss before tax during 2023 due to higher other operating income and lower operating expenses, partially offset by higher net interest expense. 

Net interest expense increased during 2023 driven by a higher cost of funds reflecting the impact of higher market rates. 

Other operating income increased during 2023 due primarily to higher net funding credits associated with MSS trading activities which increased by $279 million. Also contributing to the increase were favorable fair value adjustments on certain investments held for Community Reinvestment Act purposes. 

Operating expenses decreased during 2023 due primarily to the non-recurrence of allocated costs recorded in 2022 related to the delivery of our Restructuring Plan from HTSU and other HSBC affiliates, primarily support service project costs and severance costs, as well as lower lease impairment and other related costs driven by $38 million of costs recorded in 2022 primarily associated with the exit of certain office space. These decreases were partially offset by $243 million of deposit insurance special assessment fees which were accrued in the fourth quarter of 2023 associated with a final rule issued by the FDIC in November.

Credit Quality 

##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END

In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of transactions that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers. We participate in lending activity throughout the United States and, on a limited basis, internationally. 

Allowance for Credit Losses / Liability for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures &#160; Our accounting policies and methodologies related to the allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures are presented under the caption "Critical Accounting Estimates" in this MD&#38;A and in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our approach toward credit risk management is summarized under the caption "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A. 

The following table summarizes our allowance for credit losses and the liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures:

##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END

(1) Primarily includes accrued interest receivables and customer acceptances. 

The total allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023 increased $7 million or 1 percent as compared with December 31, 2022 due to a higher loss estimate on our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by a lower loss estimate on our consumer loan portfolio. 

Our commercial allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023 increased $23 million or 4 percent as compared with December 31, 2022 driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with higher risk industry exposures. These increases were partially offset by improved economic forecasts, the charge-off of a corporate banking loan and a decline in credit reserves for risk associated with large loan exposures. 

Our consumer allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023 decreased $16 million or 48 percent as compared with December 31, 2022 driven by improved housing price forecasts, partially offset by an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with a change in New York State foreclosure law as well as a modest deterioration in home equity mortgages. 

The liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures at December 31, 2023 decreased $6 million or 5 percent as compared with December 31, 2022 resulting primarily from improved economic forecasts.

(1) At December 31, 2023 and 2022, consumer mortgage loan delinquency includes $61 million and $60 million, respectively, of loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. 

(2) The following table reflects dollars of contractual delinquency and delinquency ratios for interest-only loans and adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loans:

Our two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 46 basis points compared with December 31, 2022 due to higher dollars of delinquency in our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by lower dollars of delinquency in our consumer loan portfolio. 

Our commercial loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 74 basis points compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to higher dollars of delinquency driven by two commercial real estate loans and a large private banking client which became 60 days past due, partially offset by collections. 

Our consumer loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio decreased 19 basis points compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to lower dollars of delinquency in residential mortgages reflecting collections. Also contributing to the decrease in the ratio, to a lesser extent, were higher outstanding loan balances.

Our net charge-off ratio increased 6 basis points during 2023 due to a higher level of net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio driven by the deterioration of a corporate banking loan as well as a higher level of net charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio due in part to the impact of certain legacy mass market credit cards and other consumer loans which were transferred from held for sale back to held for investment in the fourth quarter of 2022.

(3) Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans held for investment include all loans which are 90 or more days contractually delinquent as well as loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not re-affirmed and second lien loans where the first lien loan that we own or service is 90 or more days contractually delinquent. 

(4) Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans for all periods does not include guaranteed loans purchased from the Government National Mortgage Association. Repayment of these loans is predominantly insured by the Federal Housing Administration and as such, these loans have different risk characteristics from the rest of our customer loan portfolio. 

(5) Includes $1 million or less of commercial other real estate owned at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Our nonperforming loans ratio increased 29 basis points compared with December 31, 2022 due to higher nonperforming loans in our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by lower nonperforming loans in our consumer loan portfolio. 

Our commercial nonperforming loans ratio increased 54 basis points compared with December 31, 2022 due to higher nonperforming loans driven by downgrades, including the downgrade of a commercial real estate loan, partially offset by paydowns and loan sales. 

Our consumer nonperforming loans ratio decreased 31 basis points compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to lower nonperforming loans in residential mortgages reflecting collections and customers returning to accrual status. Also contributing to the decrease in the ratio, to a lesser extent, were higher outstanding loan balances. 

Accrued but unpaid interest on loans placed on nonaccrual status generally is reversed and reduces current income at the time loans are so categorized. Interest income on these loans may be recognized to the extent of cash payments received. Our policies and practices for problem loan management and placing loans on nonaccrual status are summarized in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Concentration of Credit Risk A concentration of credit risk is defined as a significant credit exposure with an individual or group engaged in similar activities or affected similarly by economic conditions. We enter into a variety of transactions in the normal course of business that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers. We manage the varying degrees of credit risk associated with on and off-balance sheet transactions through specific credit policies and procedures which provide for a strict approval, monitoring and reporting process. It is our policy to require collateral when it is deemed appropriate. Varying degrees and types of collateral are secured depending upon management's credit evaluation.

&#8226; ARM loans &#8211; A loan which allows us to adjust pricing on the loan in line with market movements. 

The following table summarizes the balances of interest-only and ARM loans in our loan portfolios, excluding mortgages held for sale, at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Each category is not mutually exclusive and loans may appear in more than one category below.

Credit Risks Associated with Derivative Contracts Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. In managing derivative credit risk, both the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered. Counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions, central clearing parties, foreign and domestic government agencies, corporations, funds (mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.), insurance companies and private clients as well as other HSBC entities. These counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department. To minimize credit risk, we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events. In addition, we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties. The determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty and/or regulatory requirements. 

The total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables, such as: 

&#8226; volatility of interest rates, currencies, equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments; 

&#8226; current market events or trends; 

&#8226; country risk; 

&#8226; maturity and liquidity of contracts; 

&#8226; creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction; 

&#8226; the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties; and 

&#8226; existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures. 

The table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general risk-based capital rules of the Basel III Standardized Approach which includes the net positive mark-to-market of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount. The regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and, therefore, allow for reductions of risk-weighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists. As a result, risk-weighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures. Furthermore, many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral. In addition, many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date. As a result, these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END

Effective liquidity management is defined as ensuring we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. To achieve this objective, we have guidelines that require sufficient liquidity to cover potential funding requirements in both the short- and long-term and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Guidelines are set for the consolidated balance sheet of HSBC USA to ensure that it is a source of strength for our regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiary, as well as to address the more limited sources of liquidity available to it as a holding company. Similar guidelines are set for HSBC Bank USA to ensure that it can meet its liquidity needs in various stress scenarios. Cash flow analysis, including stress testing scenarios, forms the basis for liquidity management and contingency funding plans. See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, including information regarding the key measures employed to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk. 

Regional bank failures earlier in 2023 triggered turmoil throughout the banking industry as contagion fears spread. We did not experience any significant impact to our liquidity, deposits or funding capabilities as a result of this industry turmoil. 

Interest Bearing Deposits with Banks totaled $25,015 million and $17,744 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of which $24,830 million and $17,633 million, respectively, were held with the Federal Reserve Bank. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Surplus interest bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank may be deployed into securities purchased under agreements to resell or other investments depending on market conditions and the opportunity to maximize returns. 

Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell totaled $13,878 million and $23,085 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. 

Trading Assets includes securities totaling $20,493 million and $16,285 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD&#38;A for further analysis and discussion on trends. 

Securities includes securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity totaling $40,772 million and $34,662 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD&#38;A for further analysis and discussion on trends. 

Short-Term Borrowings totaled $9,914 million and $5,945 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD&#38;A for further analysis and discussion on short-term borrowing trends. 

Deposits totaled $121,283 million and $123,223 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD&#38;A for further analysis and discussion on deposit trends. 

Estimate of Uninsured Deposits At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the estimated amount of uninsured deposits totaled $81,490 million and $86,909 million, respectively, generally representing the portion of domestic deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 and amounts in any other uninsured deposit account. The amount of uninsured deposits is calculated on a HUSI consolidated basis utilizing methodologies and assumptions similar to what is used for our bank regulatory reporting requirements. 

The scheduled maturities of the portion of domestic time deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit and time deposits that are otherwise uninsured at December 31, 2023 are summarized in the following table:

See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD&#38;A for further analysis and discussion on long-term debt trends, including additional information on debt issued and repaid during 2023. 

Under our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, we may issue certain securities including debt securities and preferred stock. We satisfy the eligibility requirements for designation as a "well-known seasoned issuer," which allows us to file a registration statement that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. The ability to issue under the registration statement is limited by the authority granted by the Board of Directors. At December 31, 2023, we were authorized to issue up to $15,000 million, of which $5,773 million was available. HSBC Bank USA has a $40,000 million Global Bank Note Program that provides for the issuance of subordinated and senior notes, of which $11,968 million was available at December 31, 2023. 

As a member of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we have secured borrowing facilities which are collateralized by loans and investment securities. At December 31, 2023, long-term debt included $1,000 million of borrowings from the FHLB facility. Based upon the amounts pledged as collateral under these facilities, we have additional borrowing capacity of up to $24,524 million. 

Preferred Equity See Note 19, "Preferred Stock," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding all outstanding HSBC USA preferred share issues. 

Common Equity During 2023, HSBC USA received common stock dividends of $1.8 billion from its subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA, and paid dividends on its common stock of $1.5 billion from retained earnings to its parent, HSBC North America. 

Capital Ratios In managing capital, we develop targets for common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, total capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average assets (i.e., the "Tier 1 leverage ratio"). Capital targets are reviewed at least semi-annually to ensure they reflect our business mix and risk profile, as well as real-time conditions and circumstances. The following table summarizes HSBC USA's Basel III capital ratios calculated as of December 31, 2023 and 2022: 

##TABLE_START 2023 2022 Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 13.0 &#160; % 13.5 % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 13.3 &#160; 13.8 Total capital to risk-weighted assets 15.7 &#160; 16.1

##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END

(1) Adjusted quarterly average assets, the Tier 1 leverage ratio denominator, reflects quarterly average assets adjusted for amounts permitted to be deducted from Tier 1 capital. 

We manage capital in accordance with HSBC Group policy. The HSBC North America Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ("ICAAP") works in conjunction with the HSBC Group's ICAAP. The HSBC North America ICAAP applies to HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA and evaluates regulatory capital adequacy and capital adequacy under various stress scenarios. Our approach is to meet our capital needs for these stress scenarios locally through activities which reduce risk. To the extent that local alternatives are insufficient, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, we would seek support from our ultimate parent. Regulatory capital requirements are based on the amount of capital required to be held, plus applicable capital buffers, as defined by regulations, and the amount of risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure, also calculated based on regulatory definitions. 

We are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators including Basel III (the "Basel III rule"). The Basel III rule establishes minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for banks and bank holding companies ("BHCs"). HSBC North America, HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA each calculate their risk-based capital requirements for credit risk under the Standardized Approach in the Basel III rule. In 2019, the FRB and the other federal banking agencies jointly finalized rules to implement the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards for large BHC and foreign banking organizations (the "Tailoring Rules"). The Tailoring Rules assign each BHC and IHC with $50 billion or more in total U.S. assets into one of five classifications (Categories I through IV, and 'other firms') based on its size and four risk-based indicators. Under the Tailoring Rules, HSBC 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

North America and HSBC Bank USA are subject to Category IV standards. For additional discussion of the Basel III rule requirements, including required minimum capital ratios, as well as further discussion of the Tailoring Rules, Category IV standards and other related regulatory developments and their expected impact see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in this Form 10-K. We continue to review the composition of our capital structure. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing The FRB requires certain U.S. top-tier BHCs and IHCs, including HSBC North America, to comply with the FRB's capital plan rule and CCAR program, as well as the supervisory stress tests conducted by the FRB. The stress tests are forward looking exercises to assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB on the financial condition and capital adequacy of a CCAR firm over a nine quarter planning horizon. As a Category IV firm, HSBC North America is subject to supervisory stress testing on a biennial basis, and it may opt-in to such testing in an "off year" in order to recalibrate its stress capital buffer based on its most recent supervisory stress test. The FRB continues to supervise Category IV firms on an ongoing basis, including evaluation of the capital adequacy and capital planning processes during off-cycle years. For further discussion of capital planning and stress testing, including detail regarding the FRB's supervisory assessment as part of the CCAR process, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in this Form 10-K. 

HSBC North America submitted its 2023 CCAR capital plan in April 2023. As discussed above, HSBC North America is subject to supervisory stress testing on a biennial basis and, therefore, did not participate in the FRB's 2023 supervisory stress test. Capital planning and stress testing for HSBC North America may impact our future capital and liquidity. 

While BHC regulatory capital compliance is generally performed at the HSBC North America level, and also separately for HSBC Bank USA, as a BHC we are required to meet minimum capital requirements imposed by the FRB. We present our capital ratios, together with HSBC Bank USA's in Note 26, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

HSBC USA Inc. HSBC USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, and the parent company of HSBC Bank USA and other subsidiaries through which we offer a wide range of commercial and consumer banking products and related financial services. HSBC USA's main source of funds is cash received from financing activities, primarily through debt issuance to third parties and affiliates. It also receives cash from affiliates by issuing preferred stock, from subsidiaries in the form of dividends and from its parent by receiving capital contributions when necessary. 

HSBC USA received cash dividends from its subsidiaries totaling $1,955 million in 2023. During 2023, HSBC USA did not receive any cash capital contributions from its parent, HSBC North America. 

HSBC USA has a number of obligations to meet with its available cash. It must be able to service its debt and meet the capital needs of its subsidiaries. It also must pay dividends on its preferred stock and may pay dividends on its common stock. HSBC USA paid dividends on its preferred stock totaling $16 million in 2023. During 2023, HSBC USA also paid dividends on its common stock totaling $1.5 billion. We may pay additional dividends in the future, but will maintain our capital at levels consistent with our regulatory requirements, risk appetite and internal capital adequacy process. 

At various times, we will make capital contributions to our subsidiaries to comply with regulatory guidance, support receivable growth, maintain acceptable investment grade ratings at the subsidiary level, or provide funding for long-term facilities and technology improvements. During 2023, HSBC USA made a capital contribution of $17 million to its subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA. 

As of December 31, 2023, HSBC Bank USA has the ability to pay dividends under bank regulatory guidelines, as cumulative net income for 2021 through 2023 exceeded dividends attributable to this period. Any reduction of permanent capital of HSBC Bank USA would require OCC approval. See Note 26, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details. In determining the extent of dividends to pay, HSBC Bank USA must also consider the effect of dividend payments on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of federal regulatory agencies that indicate banking organizations should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings. 

Subsidiaries At December 31, 2023, we had one major subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA. We manage substantially all of our operations through HSBC Bank USA, which contributes to the funding of our businesses primarily through receiving deposits from customers, the collection of receivable balances, issuing short-term, medium-term and long-term debt and selling residential mortgage loans. The vast majority of our domestic medium-term notes and long-term debt is marketed through subsidiaries of HSBC. Intermediate and long-term debt may also be marketed through unaffiliated investment banks. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

2024 Funding Strategy Our current estimate for funding needs and sources for 2024 are summarized in the following table: 

##TABLE_START &#160; (in billions) Increase (decrease) in funding needs: Net change in loans $ 4 Net change in short-term investments and securities (5) Net change in trading and other assets (2) Total funding needs $ (3) Increase (decrease) in funding sources: Net change in deposits $ (1) Net change in trading and other short-term liabilities (1) Net change in long-term debt (1) Total funding sources $ (3) ##TABLE_END

The above table reflects a long-term funding strategy. Daily balances fluctuate as we accommodate customer needs, while ensuring that we have liquidity in place to support the balance sheet maturity funding profile. Should market conditions deteriorate, we have contingency plans to generate additional liquidity through the sales of assets or financing transactions. We remain confident in our ability to access the market for long-term debt funding needs in the current market environment. We continue to seek well-priced and stable customer deposits. We also continue to sell new agency-eligible conforming residential mortgage loans to third parties. 

HSBC Bank USA is subject to significant restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other 'covered transactions' with HSBC USA and other affiliates. For further discussion, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Affiliate Transaction Restrictions," in this Form 10-K. 

See "Risk Management" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion relating to our liquidity contingency plans and our approach to liquidity and funding risk management. 

Material Cash Requirements Our material cash requirements comprise primarily contractual obligations to make future payments related to time deposits, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and operating lease obligations. The following table summarizes our material cash requirements outstanding as of December 31, 2023 by period due: 

##TABLE_START 

&#160; &#160; 

Due Within One Year Due After One Year Total &#160; (in millions) Time deposits $ 17,986 $ 3,218 $ 21,204 Short-term borrowings 9,914 &#8212; 9,914

4,710 13,951 18,661 Operating lease obligations 60 731 791 Total $ 32,670 $ 17,900 $ 50,570 ##TABLE_END

These short- and long-term cash obligations could be funded primarily through cash collection on loans and receipt of deposits, supplemented by the issuance of new short-term and long-term unsecured debt or secured financing repurchase agreements. Particular emphasis is placed on our ability to fund those short-term cash obligations that are due within one year. See "2024 Funding Strategy" above for additional information. In addition to the table above, we also have contractual cash obligations related to certain binding agreements we have entered into for loan servicing, securities processing, asset management services, lockbox and other services which are not material to our liquidity needs. 

Capital Expenditures We made capital expenditures of $36 million during both 2023 and 2022. In addition to these amounts, during 2023 and 2022, we capitalized $142 million and $116 million, respectively, relating to improving and modernizing our business systems. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal operations, we enter into credit derivatives and various off-balance sheet arrangements with affiliates and third parties. These arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily commitments to extend credit and, in certain cases, guarantees. 

Commitments to extend credit include arrangements whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans, participations in loans or similar transactions. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had commitments to extend credit totaling $87.4 billion and $88.8 billion, respectively, comprised primarily of commercial commitments and, to a lesser extent, consumer commitments. Commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

of credit. Consumer commitments comprise unused MasterCard/Visa credit card lines, where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer, and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties, where we have the right to change terms or conditions, for cause, upon notification to the customer. For a summary of guarantees, including standby letters of credit and certain credit derivative transactions, as well as the contractual amounts outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022, see Note 28, "Guarantee Arrangements, Pledged Asset and Repurchase Agreements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee. Many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default. As a result, we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. 

In addition, we had commitments to purchase securities under agreements to resell on a forward starting basis totaling $4.8 billion at December 31, 2023. These contracts expired in January 2024 and were secured by collateral from U.S. Treasury securities. 

Our off-balance sheet arrangements also include transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs"). See Note 27, "Variable Interest Entities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of these unconsolidated VIEs. 

Fair Value 

##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END

Fair Value Hierarchy Fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the "Fair Value Framework"). The Fair Value Framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants' assumptions. It emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs. For financial instruments carried at fair value, the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market (Level 1). Where the market for a financial instrument is not active, valuation techniques are used. The majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument (Level 2). Because Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are determined by observable inputs, less judgment is applied in determining their fair values. In the absence of observable market inputs, the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve. We consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy: 

&#8226; whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price; 

&#8226; the level of bid-ask spreads; 

&#8226; a lack of pricing transparency due to, among other things, complexity of the product and market liquidity; 

&#8226; whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time; 

&#8226; whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services; 

&#8226; whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data; and 

&#8226; whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value. 

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. A financial instrument is classified as a Level 1 measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume. We regard financial instruments such as debt securities, equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded. Non-exchange-traded instruments classified as Level 1 assets include securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, to-be-announced securities, non-callable securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign government-backed debt. 

Level 2 inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as Level 1 inputs. We classify mortgage pass-through securities, agency and certain non-agency mortgage collateralized obligations, non-exchange-traded derivative contracts, asset-backed securities, obligations of U.S. states and political subdivisions, corporate debt securities, certain foreign government-backed debt, preferred securities, securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, precious metals, certain loans held for sale, certain student loans, residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, real estate owned and certain client share repurchase 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

transactions as Level 2 measurements. Where possible, at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments. We have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third-party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and, where appropriate, this pricing data is back-tested to market trade executions. Where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value, we investigate and reconcile the differences. If the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value, the instrument will be classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. In general, we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a non-derivative instrument. 

Level 2 derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity. The fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the OTC market. Appropriate control processes and procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors. 

Level 3 inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability. That is, Level 3 inputs incorporate market participants' assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk. We develop Level 3 inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, our Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value included the following: certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded derivatives have significant unobservable inputs (e.g., volatility or default correlations), certain asset-backed securities, individually assessed commercial loans, mortgage servicing rights, derivatives with certain inputs which are unobservable, certain credit default swaps, certain loans held for sale and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation. See Note 29, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on Level 3 inputs.

Significant Changes in Fair Value for Level 3 Assets and Liabilities See Note 29, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into (out of) Level 3 measurements during 2023 and 2022 as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 

Effect of Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs &#160; The fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by, derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent. Changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments. For the purpose of preparing the financial statements, the final valuation inputs selected are based on management's best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities. 

The unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures. When we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time, it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $27 million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

of approximately $72 million at December 31, 2023. The effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of certain credit-linked structured notes and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares. 

Risk Management 

##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END

Overview &#160; The primary role of risk management is to protect our customers, business, colleagues and the communities that we serve, while ensuring we are able to support our strategy and provide sustainable growth. 

Our risk management framework We aim to use a comprehensive risk management approach across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our culture and values. This is outlined in our risk management framework, including the key principles and practices that we employ in managing material risks, both financial and non-financial. This framework fosters continuous monitoring, promotes risk awareness, and encourages sound operational and strategic decision-making and escalation processes. It also supports a consistent approach to identifying, assessing, managing, and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities, with clear accountabilities. We continue to actively review and develop our risk management framework and enhance our approach to managing risk through our activities with regard to people and capabilities, governance, reporting and management information, credit risk management models, and data. 

Our risk culture We recognize the importance of a strong culture which refers to shared attitudes, values and standards that shape behaviors related to risk awareness, risk taking and risk management. All our people are responsible for the management of risk, with the ultimate responsibility for the effective oversight of risk management residing with our Board of Directors. 

We seek to build our business for the long term by balancing social, environment and economic considerations in the decisions we make. Our strategic priorities are underpinned by our endeavor to operate in a sustainable way. This helps us to carry out our social responsibility and manage the risk profile of our business. We are committed to managing and mitigating climate-related risks, both physical and transition risks, and continue to incorporate consideration of these into how we manage and oversee risks internally and with our customers. 

The following principles guide our overarching appetite for risk and determine how our businesses and risks are managed: 

&#8226; We aim to maintain a strong capital position, defined by regulatory and internal capital ratios. 

&#8226; We carry out effective liquidity and funding management. 

&#8226; We seek to generate returns in line with our risk appetite and strong risk management capability. 

&#8226; We aim to deliver sustainable and diversified earnings and consistent returns. 

&#8226; We consider and, where appropriate, mitigate reputational risk that may arise from our business activities and decisions. 

&#8226; We have no appetite for deliberately or knowingly causing detriment to clients, counterparties or vendors, or incurring a breach of the letter or spirit of regulatory requirements. 

&#8226; We have no appetite for inappropriate market conduct by a member of our staff or by any of our lines of business. 

&#8226; We are committed to managing the climate risks that have an impact on our financial position and delivering on the HSBC Group's net zero ambition. 

&#8226; We monitor non-financial risk exposure against risk appetite, including exposure related to inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or events that impact our customers or can lead to censure or reputational damage. 

Risk governance Our Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for the effective oversight of risk management and approves our risk appetite. It is advised on risk matters by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, notably risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy, risk governance and internal controls, as well as high-level risk related matters. We use a defined executive risk governance structure to help ensure there is appropriate oversight and accountability embedded throughout our business for the effective management of risk. 

The Chief Risk Officer ("CRO"), supported by the Risk Management Meeting of the HSBC USA Executive Committee ("RMM"), holds executive accountability for the ongoing monitoring, assessment and management of the risk environment and the effectiveness of the risk management framework. The management of financial crime risk resides with the U.S. Head of Financial Crime and Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Officer. Day-to-day responsibility for risk management is delegated to senior managers with individual accountability for decision making. 

Our responsibilities All our people are responsible for identifying and managing risk within the scope of their roles. Roles are defined using the Three Lines of Defense ("LoD") model, which takes into account our business and functional structures. This model delineates management accountabilities and responsibilities for risk management and the control environment. The 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

model underpins our approach to risk management by clarifying responsibilities, encouraging collaboration, and enabling efficient coordination of risk and control activities. The Three LoD are summarized below: 

&#8226; The First LoD owns the risks and is responsible for identifying, recording, reporting, and managing them in line with risk appetite, and ensuring that the right controls and assessments are in place to mitigate them. 

&#8226; The Second LoD challenges the First LoD on effective risk management and provides advice and guidance in relation to the risk. 

&#8226; The Third LoD is our Internal Audit function, which provides independent assurance as to whether our risk management approach and processes are designed and operating effectively. 

The principle of individual accountability is exercised across the organization and is fundamental to effective risk management. Decisions are made by specific individuals in line with their mandates and/or delegated authority to ensure clear accountability. This includes those decisions made where approval should be requested from the accountable individual. Individual accountability is reinforced through the Three LoD model. The Board of Directors and its committees are collective decision-making bodies, as is the RMM. All employees are required to identify, assess and manage risk within the scope of their assigned responsibilities and, as such, they are critical to the effectiveness of the Three LoD model. 

Risk function Our Risk function, headed by the CRO, is responsible for our risk management framework. This responsibility includes establishing policies, monitoring risk profiles and forward-looking risk identification and management. Our Risk function is made up of sub-functions covering all risks to our business. The Risk function forms part of the Second LoD. It is independent from our lines of business, including sales and trading functions, to provide challenge, appropriate oversight and balance in risk/reward decisions. The CRO reports to the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and to the HSBC Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer. The CRO also reports on risk related matters to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Executive accountability for the ongoing monitoring, assessment and management of the risk environment and the effectiveness of the risk management framework resides with the CRO, supported by the RMM. 

Specific oversight of various risk management processes occurs through the following meetings: 

&#8226; the Asset and Liability Management Committee ("ALCO"); 

&#8226; the Reputational Risk and Client Selection Committees ("RRCSCs"); and 

&#8226; Line of business ("LoB") risk management and oversight meetings. 

Each of these committees, as well as the RMM, have separate charters which detail their respective roles and responsibilities. 

ALCO provides oversight of all capital, liquidity, interest rate and market risk and is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer. ALCO sets the limits of acceptable risk, monitors the adequacy of the tools used to measure risk and assesses the adequacy of reporting. In managing these risks, we seek to protect both our income stream and the value of our assets. ALCO also conducts contingency planning with regard to liquidity. 

The RRCSC structure supports the appropriate consideration of customers and transactions that may adversely affect our public perception. RRCSCs exist in each business and comprise senior members from the business, risk, legal, financial crime and compliance departments and other invited parties. The RRCSCs provide decision-making and guidance in respect of reputational risks and customer selection matters, and are responsible for ensuring that issues are appropriately tracked and resolved. 

The LoB risk management and oversight meetings provide recommendations and advice, as requested, to their respective LoB senior management teams in the exercise of their powers, authorities and discretions in relation to the enterprise-wide management of all risks within or impacting their respective businesses. 

Enterprise-wide risk management tools We use a range of tools to identify, monitor and manage risk. The key enterprise-wide risk management tools are summarized below: 

&#8226; Risk identification - Risk identification is a tool that allows us to provide a holistic view of risks facing the organization stemming from our unique business activities and associated exposures, including those that are difficult to quantify or only materialize under stressful conditions. The process is integrated with and built upon existing risk management tools such as top and emerging risk reporting as well as risk and control assessments. The risk identification process takes place on a quarterly basis and involves senior representatives from the First and Second LoD. Senior management governance is provided by the RMM with results presented to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors on an annual basis. Material risks identified are actively monitored and used to inform key aspects of our capital planning and stress testing program. 

&#8226; Risk appetite - The CRO oversees the development of our risk appetite which defines, shapes and monitors our risk profile. The HSBC North America Risk Appetite Statement ("RAS") is a written articulation of the aggregate level and types of risk that we are willing to accept in order to achieve our strategic business objectives. HSBC North America's conservative risk profile is articulated in the qualitative section of the RAS, which serves as guidance to embed risk 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

appetite and supports strategic and operational decision making at HUSI. The quantitative section of the RAS contains a set of key metrics covering both financial and non-financial risks. Non-financial risk is defined as the risk to achieving our strategy or objectives as a result of inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. 

Performance against the RAS metrics alongside key risk indicators is monitored by senior management and reported to the RMM and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors on a periodic basis, enabling senior management to monitor the risk profile and guide business activity to balance risk and return. All breaches of risk appetite thresholds and actions to remediate the breaches are documented and reviewed. This process helps to embed a strong risk culture across our businesses. The risk appetite profile is one of the key tools in the wider enterprise risk management framework, which drives the core of our active risk management. The RAS is aligned to strategic and financial planning and therefore provides a top down view of risk and return objectives. 

&#8226; Risk map - We utilize a risk map to provide a point-in-time view of our residual risk profile across a range of both financial and non-financial risk categories, including our principal banking risks. It assesses the potential of these risks to have a material impact on our financial results, reputation or sustainability of our business. Risks that have an 'amber' or 'red' rating require a rating justification to outline the key issues and monitoring and mitigating action plans to be in place to manage the risk down to acceptable levels. 

&#8226; Top and emerging risks - We use a top and emerging risks process to provide a forward-looking view of risks with the potential to threaten the execution of our strategy or operations. The top and emerging risks framework enables us to take action which either stop these risks from materializing or limit their impact. We proactively assess the internal and external risk environment as well as review the themes identified across our businesses and functions to update our top and emerging risks as necessary. A 'top risk' is defined as a risk we are currently managing which, if not managed and mitigated, has the potential to have a material impact on our financial results, reputation or business model. It may arise across any combinations of risk types or businesses. The impact of a 'top risk' may be well understood by senior management and some mitigating actions may already be in place. An 'emerging risk' is defined as a risk that could have a material impact on the risk profile of the organization, but is not under active management and is not immediate. Existing mitigating plans for an 'emerging risk' are likely to be minimal, reflecting the uncertain nature of these risks at this stage. 

&#8226; Stress testing - Stress testing is an important tool we use to assess potential vulnerabilities in our businesses, business model or portfolios. We operate a comprehensive stress testing program that supports our risk management and capital planning processes. It includes execution of stress tests mandated by our regulators, is supported by dedicated teams and infrastructure, and is overseen by senior management. It demonstrates our capital strength and enhances our resilience to external shocks. It allows us to understand the sensitivities of the core assumptions in our strategic and capital plans and improve decision making through balancing risk and return. In addition to taking part in regulators' stress tests, we conduct our own internal stress tests. Internal stress test scenarios are closely aligned to our assessment of top and emerging risks and help inform risk appetite thresholds. These may prompt management actions, including a reduction in limits or direct exposures, or closer monitoring of exposures sensitive to stress. 

&#8226; Models - In the course of our regular risk management activities, we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking. The output from some of these models is included in this section of our filing. By their nature, models are based on various assumptions and relationships. We believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable within the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate, but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models. In actual stressed market conditions, these assumptions and relationships may no longer hold, causing actual experience to differ from the results predicted in the model. Adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results. Models are also monitored to confirm they are performing as intended. 

Key developments in 2023 We continued to actively manage the risks related to macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties. In addition, we enhanced our risk management in the following areas: 

&#8226; We continued to make progress to strengthen our regulatory reporting processes, improve consistency and enhance controls. 

&#8226; We continued to embed climate considerations throughout the organization, including through risk policy updates, and evolve metrics to monitor climate risk. 

&#8226; We continued to invest in industry-leading technology and advanced analytic capabilities to improve how we proactively combat financial crime. We continue to monitor regulatory changes that support innovation and effectiveness. 

&#8226; We continued to develop and enhance our policies and procedures around electronic communications to help ensure compliance with federal securities laws. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

Our material risks The principal risks associated with our operations include the following: 

&#8226; Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract; 

&#8226; Treasury risk is the risk of having insufficient capital, liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements, including the risk of an adverse impact on earnings or capital due to changes in market interest rates, together with pension risk; 

&#8226; Market risk is the risk of an adverse financial impact on trading activities arising from changes in market parameters such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, asset prices, volatilities, correlations and credit spreads; 

&#8226; Climate risk relates to the financial and non-financial impacts that may arise as a consequence of climate change and the move to a net zero economy; 

&#8226; Resilience risk is the risk of sustained and significant business disruption from execution, delivery, physical security or safety events, causing the inability to provide critical services to our customers, affiliates and counterparties; 

&#8226; Regulatory compliance risk is the risk associated with breaching our duty to clients and other counterparties, inappropriate market conduct and breaching related financial services regulatory standards; 

&#8226; Financial crime risk is the risk that our products and services will be exploited for criminal activity, including fraud, bribery and corruption, tax evasion, sanctions and export control violations, money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing; 

&#8226; Strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify, execute and react appropriately to opportunities and/or threats arising from changes in the market, some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances, customer requirements, demographic trends, regulatory developments or competitor action; and 

&#8226; Model risk is the risk of inappropriate or incorrect business decisions arising from the use of models that have been inadequately designed, implemented or used, or from models that do not perform in line with expectations and predictions. 

Credit Risk Management Credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies, principles and guidance for risk managers. Credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities. 

The principle objectives of credit risk management are to: 

&#8226; maintain a strong culture of responsible lending, and robust risk policies and control frameworks; 

&#8226; both partner with and challenge our businesses in defining, implementing and continually re-evaluating our risk appetite under actual and scenario conditions; and 

&#8226; ensure there is independent scrutiny of credit risks, their cost and their mitigation. 

Credit risk arises from various on- and off-balance sheet instruments and arrangements, such as: 

&#8226; loan portfolios; 

&#8226; investment portfolios; 

&#8226; unfunded commitments such as letters of credit and lines of credit and unutilized credit card lines that customers can draw upon; and 

&#8226; derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, which may represent an exposure to the counterparty to the contract. 

While credit risk exists widely in our operations, diversification among various commercial and consumer portfolios helps to lessen risk exposure. Day-to-day management of credit risk is performed by the Chief Credit Officer and the WPB Chief Risk Officer, who report directly to the CRO and maintain independent risk functions. The credit risk associated with wholesale commercial portfolios is managed by the Chief Credit Officer, while credit risk associated with retail consumer loan portfolios is managed by the WPB Chief Risk Officer. Further discussion of credit risk can be found under the "Credit Quality" caption in this MD&#38;A. 

Our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles, including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty. The Credit Risk function continues to refine early warning indicators and reporting, including stress testing scenarios on the basis of recent experience. Stress testing results are taken into consideration within our business planning process. Action has been taken, where necessary, to improve our resilience to risks associated with the current market conditions by selectively discontinuing business lines or products, closely managing underwriting criteria and investing in improved fraud prevention technologies. At December 31, 2023, economic uncertainty remains due to elevated interest rates, inflation levels and the expectation for slowing economic growth. We continue to monitor the performance of our material commercial loans as conditions evolve and take necessary credit actions where warranted. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

The responsibilities of the Credit Risk function include: 

&#8226; Formulating credit risk policies &#8211; Our policies are designed to ensure that all of our various retail and wholesale business units operate within clear standards of acceptable credit risk. Our policies ensure that the HSBC standards are consistently implemented across all businesses and that all regulatory requirements are also considered. Credit policies are reviewed and approved annually at the RMM and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. 

&#8226; Approving new credit exposures and independently assessing large exposures annually &#8211; Credit approval authorities are delegated by the Board of Directors to the CEO and subsequently sub-delegated to the CRO with the authority to sub-delegate to the Chief Credit Officer and WPB Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Credit Officer and WPB Chief Risk Officer in turn delegate limited credit authority to the various lending units. However, most wholesale credits are reviewed and approved centrally through a dedicated Credit Approval Unit that reports directly to the Chief Credit Officer. In addition, the Chief Credit Officer coordinates the review of material credits with HSBC Group Credit Risk which, subject to certain agreed-upon limits, will concur on material new and renewal transactions. Large retail credits are escalated to the WPB Chief Risk Officer for review and concurrence. 

&#8226; Overseeing retail credit and collateral risk &#8211; The WPB Chief Risk Officer manages the credit and collateral risk associated with retail portfolios, supported by expertise from a dedicated advanced risk analytics unit. Collateral risk in retail arises when the underlying value of the property securing a retail loan loses value due to macroeconomic, housing market or industry conditions. This risk is actively managed through on-going monitoring of house price indices in the metropolitan statistical areas in which the mortgage portfolio is concentrated. In areas where property values are declining, maximum LTV requirements will be adjusted downward to compensate for this risk. 

&#8226; Maintaining and developing the governance and operation of the wholesale risk rating system &#8211; A two-dimensional credit risk rating system is utilized in order to categorize exposures meaningfully and enable focused management of the risks involved. This rating system comprises a 23 category customer risk rating, which considers the probability of default of an obligor, and a separate facility risk rating, representing an assessment of the obligor's expected performance in servicing its obligations in accordance with the terms. Rating methodologies are based upon a wide range of analytics and market data-based tools, which are core inputs to the assessment of counterparty risk. Although automated risk rating processes are increasingly used, for larger facilities the ultimate responsibility for setting risk ratings rests in each case with the final approving executive. Risk ratings are reviewed frequently and amendments, where necessary, are implemented promptly. 

&#8226; Measuring portfolio credit risk &#8211; We continue to advance the measurement of the risk in our credit portfolios using techniques such as stress testing in certain internal reporting. Efforts continue to refine both the inputs and assumptions used to increase the usefulness in the evaluation of large and small commercial and retail customer portfolio products and business unit return on risk. 

&#8226; Monitoring portfolio performance &#8211; Credit data warehouses have been implemented to centralize the reporting of credit risk, support the analysis of risk and to calculate credit loss reserves. These data warehouses also support HSBC's wider effort to meet the requirements of Basel III and to generate credit reports for management and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. 

&#8226; Establishing counterparty and portfolio limits &#8211; We monitor and limit our wholesale exposure to individual counterparties and to the combined exposure of related counterparties. In addition, selected industry portfolios, such as real estate, are subject to caps that are recommended by the Chief Credit Officer and reviewed where appropriate by management committees and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Retail establishes portfolio limits by product as well as limits on new products and higher-risk segments such as investment property, high LTV mortgages and credit cards. These limits are approved by the WPB Chief Risk Officer and monitored by a retail credit risk management committee. Counterparty credit exposure related to derivative activities is also managed under approved limits. Since the exposure related to derivatives is variable and uncertain, internal risk management methodologies are used to calculate the 95 percent worst-case potential future exposure for each customer. These methodologies take into consideration, among other factors, cross-product close-out netting, collateral received from customers under collateral support annexes, termination clauses, and off-setting positions within the portfolio. 

&#8226; Managing problem loans &#8211; Special attention is paid to problem loans. When appropriate, our wholesale Special Credits Unit and retail Collection and Recovery teams provide customers with intensive management and support in order to help them avoid default wherever possible and maximize recoveries. 

&#8226; Establishing allowances for credit losses &#8211; The Chief Credit Officer and the WPB Chief Risk Officer share responsibility with the Chief Financial Officer for establishing appropriate levels of allowances for credit losses inherent in our various loan and other portfolios carried at amortized cost. This responsibility includes overseeing the processes for: model performance monitoring and redevelopment of new models, establishing forward-looking economic scenarios, projecting results from the impairment calculation engine, and determining management judgment utilized for estimating lifetime ECL. Management review committees, comprising representatives from 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

Credit Risk and Finance, have been established in order to review and challenge the results of the lifetime ECL calculations before approving them each period. 

Credit Review is an independent and critical Second LoD function. Its mission is to identify and evaluate areas of credit risk within our business. Credit Review will focus on the review and evaluation of wholesale and retail lending activities and will identify risks and provide an ongoing assessment as to the effectiveness of the risk management framework and the related portfolios. Credit Review will independently assess the business units and risk management functions to ensure the portfolios are managed and operating in a manner that is consistent with HSBC Group strategy, risk appetite, appropriate local and HSBC Group credit policies and procedures and applicable regulatory requirements. For example, this includes the unilateral authority to independently assess and revise customer risk ratings, facility risk ratings and loss given default estimates. To ensure its independent stature, the Credit Review Delegation of Authority is endorsed by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors which grants the Head of Credit Review unhindered access to the Risk Committee and executive sessions at the discretion of the Head of Credit Review. Accordingly, our Risk Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight of the Credit Review annual and ongoing plan, quarterly plan updates and results of reviews. 

Treasury Risk Management Treasury risk arises from changes to the respective resources and risk profiles driven by customer behavior, management decisions or the external environment. Treasury risks, including capital, liquidity and funding, and interest rate risk, are owned and actively managed on an ongoing basis by the Treasurer, supported by ALCO. 

Capital risk is the risk that we fail to meet our regulatory capital requirements. Capital risk arises from a deterioration in the capital base due to losses and increased risk profile from management activity or the external environment. We aim to maintain a strong capital base to support the risks inherent in our business and invest in accordance with our strategy, meeting regulatory capital requirements at all times. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for a full discussion of our approach to capital risk management, including our capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements. 

Liquidity and funding risk is the risk that we do not have sufficient financial resources to meet our obligations as they fall due or that we cannot raise funding or can only do so at excessive cost. Liquidity and funding risk arises from mismatches in the timing of cash flows or when illiquid asset positions cannot be funded at the expected terms and when required. We continuously monitor the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our liquidity and funding framework to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices. Historically, we have seen the greatest strain in the wholesale market as opposed to the retail market (the latter being the market from which we source stable demand and time deposit accounts which are less sensitive to market events or changes in interest rates). 

Liquidity is managed to provide the ability to generate cash to meet lending, deposit withdrawal and other commitments at a reasonable cost in a reasonable amount of time while maintaining routine operations and market confidence. Market funding is coordinated with other HSBC Group entities, as the markets increasingly view debt issuances from the separate companies within the context of our common parent company. Liquidity and funding risk management is performed at the HSBC North America, HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA levels. Each entity is required to have sufficient liquidity for a crisis situation. 

Liquidity risk policies and procedures have been implemented to ensure that the minimum liquidity ratios and a strong overall liquidity position are maintained. ALCO projects cash flow requirements and determines the level of liquid assets and available funding sources to have at our disposal, with consideration given to anticipated deposit and balance sheet growth, contingent liabilities, and the ability to access wholesale funding markets. In addition to base case projections, multiple stress scenarios are generated to simulate crisis conditions, including: 

&#8226; run-off of non-stable deposits; 

&#8226; inability to renew maturing interbank funding; 

&#8226; draw-downs of committed loan facilities; 

&#8226; decreases in the market value of liquid securities; 

&#8226; additional collateral requirements for derivative transactions under existing collateral support agreements; 

&#8226; rating downgrades of HSBC USA or HSBC Bank USA; and 

&#8226; increased discount on security values for repos or disposals. 

In addition, ALCO monitors the overall mix of deposit and funding concentrations to avoid undue reliance on individual funding sources and large deposit relationships. 

As part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, we employ the measures discussed below to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. 

HSBC North America is subject to the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio ("LCR") rule, which is designed to be a short-term liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets ("HQLA") to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days, and both HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA calculate and report their LCR to U.S. regulators on a daily 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

basis. During 2023, HSBC Bank USA's LCR remained above 100 percent. Under the Tailoring Rules, a 70 percent LCR requirement applies to Category IV firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding that equals or exceeds $50 billion. As a result, a LCR of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds 70 percent of a Category IV firm's liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. HQLA consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets. 

HSBC North America is also subject to the U.S. net stable funding ratio ("NSFR") rule, which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12-month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities, and both HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA calculate and report their NSFR to U.S. regulators. At both December 31, 2023 and 2022, HSBC Bank USA's NSFR exceeded 100 percent. Under the Tailoring Rules, a 70 percent NSFR requirement applies to Category IV firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding that equals or exceeds $50 billion. As a result, a NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds 70 percent of a Category IV firm's required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. In addition, under the United Kingdom ("U.K.") Prudential Regulatory Authority ("PRA") based NSFR rule, HSBC USA's NSFR exceeded 100 percent at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. Under the U.K. PRA NSFR rule, a NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. 

As a Category IV firm, HSBC North America is subject to liquidity stress testing and related liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules and may need to make changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules. 

ALCO also maintains a liquidity management and contingency funding plan ("Contingency Funding Plan"), which identifies certain potential early warning indicators of liquidity problems, and actions that can be taken both initially and in the event of a liquidity crisis, to minimize the long-term impact on our businesses and customer relationships. The Contingency Funding Plan is reviewed annually and approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. We recognize a liquidity crisis can either be specific to us, relating to our ability to meet our obligations in a timely manner, or market-wide, caused by a macro risk event in the broader financial system. A range of indicators are monitored to attain an early warning of any liquidity issues. These include widening of key spreads or indices used to track market volatility, material reductions or extreme volatility in customer deposit balances, increased utilization of credit lines, widening of our own credit spreads and higher borrowing costs. At the onset of a crisis, liquidity needs would be satisfied primarily with unsecured wholesale market funding, depending on the scenario. If the crisis escalates, contingency funding needs will be satisfied primarily through monetization of the Liquid Asset Buffer we maintain, consisting of cash, short-term liquid assets and unencumbered government and other highly rated investment securities as a source of funding. Further, collateral is maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB, including portions of the mortgage portfolio, providing additional secured borrowing capacity in a liquidity crisis. 

In addition to the oversight provided by ALCO, Treasury Risk Management ("TRM") is a Second LoD oversight function for treasury risk-related activities, including capital, liquidity and funding, and interest rate risk, which is led by the Head of Traded and Treasury Risk Management and Risk Analytics who is the accountable risk steward for treasury risks and independently reports into the CRO. TRM's primary mandate is to strengthen our treasury risk management framework through review and challenge of existing processes and recommending areas that need improvement to the RMM. TRM serves as an advisory function to senior management to ensure front line units with direct responsibility for managing treasury risk are operating within their operating guidelines and defined risk appetite parameters. The TRM oversight mandate is carried out through critical evaluation and challenge of existing risk management processes including stress testing and ratio calculations. 

Our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits, supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet, and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans. In addition, regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of HQLA. As such, we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities.

Our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit rating agencies. The following table reflects the short and long-term credit ratings of HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA at December 31, 2023:

Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and legal matters, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions. 

In October 2023, Moody's downgraded the long-term debt ratings of HSBC USA by one notch, including the senior debt rating which was downgraded to A2 from A1. These rating downgrades reflect Moody's view that there is a decrease in loss absorbing capacity debt outstanding at HSBC North America. The outlook for the senior debt ratings of HSBC USA is stable. While this rating action did not have a material financial impact on our borrowing costs or liquidity, any future actions could have such an impact. 

Although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings, there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future. At December 31, 2023, none of the ratings on the debt of HSBC USA or HSBC Bank USA from any of the rating agencies were under review for potential downgrade. 

Numerous factors, internal and external, may impact access to and costs associated with issuing debt in the global capital markets. These factors include our debt ratings, overall economic conditions, overall capital markets volatility and the effectiveness of the management of credit risks inherent in our customer base. 

Cash resources, short-term investments and a trading asset portfolio are available to provide highly liquid funding for us. Additional liquidity is provided by available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities. Approximately $2,200 million of the debt securities in these portfolios at December 31, 2023 are expected to mature in 2024. The remaining $38,572 million of debt securities not expected to mature in 2024 are available to provide liquidity by serving as collateral for secured borrowings, or if needed, by being sold. Further liquidity is available through our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets. In 2023, in addition to the normal sales of agency-eligible mortgage loan originations, we sold commercial real estate loans of approximately $439 million to third parties. 

It is the policy of HSBC Bank USA to maintain both primary and secondary collateral in order to ensure precautionary borrowing availability from the Federal Reserve Bank. Primary collateral is collateral that is physically maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank, and serves as a safety net against any unexpected funding shortfalls that may occur. Secondary collateral is collateral that is acceptable to the Federal Reserve Bank, but is not maintained there. If unutilized borrowing capacity were to be low, secondary collateral would be identified and maintained as necessary. Further liquidity is available from the FHLB. 

See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for further discussion of our liquidity position, including additional information regarding our outstanding borrowings, the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy. 

Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income due to mismatched pricing between assets and liabilities as well as losses in value due to interest rate movements. We are subject to interest rate risk associated with the repricing characteristics of our balance sheet assets and liabilities. Specifically, as interest rates change, amounts of interest earning assets and liabilities fluctuate, and interest earning assets reprice at intervals that do not correspond to the maturities or repricing patterns of interest bearing liabilities. This mismatch between assets and liabilities in repricing sensitivity results in changes to projected net interest income as interest rates move. To help manage the risks associated with changes in interest rates, and to manage net interest income within interest rate risk ranges management considers acceptable, we use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps, options, futures and forwards as hedges to modify the repricing characteristics of specific assets, liabilities, forecasted transactions or firm commitments. Analysis of this risk is complicated by having to make assumptions on embedded optionality within certain product areas such as the incidence of mortgage prepayments, and from behavioral assumptions regarding the economic duration of liabilities which are contractually repayable on demand such as current accounts. These assumptions around behavioral features are captured in our interest rate behavioralization framework, which is described further below. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

For purposes of interest rate risk, our non-trading portfolios are referred to as the banking book. Management of interest rate risk in the banking book is governed by the HSBC Group's Non-Trading Market Risk Policy. ALCO establishes our risk appetite and related limits for interest rate risk in the banking book. Day-to-day management of interest rate risk in the banking book is centralized principally in Markets Treasury, which includes the non-trading interest rate risk positions transferred to it from the global businesses as discussed further below. 

We have significant, but historically well controlled, interest rate risk in large part due to our portfolio of residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, which consumers can prepay without penalty, and our large base of demand and savings deposits. These deposits can be withdrawn by consumers at will, but historically they have been a stable source of relatively low cost funds. 

In the course of managing interest rate risk, a combination of risk assessment techniques are utilized to identify and assess the potential impact of interest rate movements and take appropriate action. This combination of techniques, with some focusing on the impact of interest rate movements on the valuation of the balance sheet (e.g., economic value of equity, present value of a basis point, repricing gap analysis, value at risk) and others focusing on the impact of interest rate movements on earnings (e.g., earnings-at-risk), allows for comprehensive analyses from different perspectives. 

A key element of managing interest rate risk is the management of the convexity of the balance sheet, largely resulting from the mortgage related products on the balance sheet. Convexity risk arises as mortgage loan consumers change their payment behavior significantly in response to large movements in market rates, but do not change behavior appreciably for smaller changes in market rates. Certain interest rate management tools, such as economic value of equity and earnings-at-risk, better capture the embedded convexity in the balance sheet, while measures such as present value of a basis point are designed to capture the risk of smaller changes in rates. Similarly, managed rate deposits with no stated maturity experience convexity that impacts net interest income sensitivity. 

The assessment techniques discussed below act as a guide for managing interest rate risk associated with balance sheet composition and off-balance sheet hedging strategy (the risk position). Calculated values within limit ranges reflect an acceptable risk position, although possible future unfavorable trends may prompt adjustments to on or off-balance sheet exposure. Calculated values outside of limit ranges will result in consideration of adjustment of the risk position, or consideration of temporary dispensation from making adjustments. 

Economic value of equity ("EVE") EVE represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed run-off scenario. An EVE sensitivity represents the change in EVE due to a defined movement in interest rates. We manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of 200 basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of 200 basis points to the market implied interest rates. At both December 31, 2023 and 2022, our EVE remained within risk limits for the up 200 and down 200 basis point interest rate shock scenarios.

Repricing gap analysis The following table shows the repricing structure of our assets and liabilities at December 31, 2023. For assets and liabilities whose cash flows are subject to change due to movements in interest rates, such as the sensitivity of mortgage loans to prepayments, data is reported based on the earlier of expected repricing or maturity and reflects anticipated prepayments based on the current rate environment. The resulting "gaps" are reviewed to assess the potential sensitivity to earnings with respect to the direction, magnitude and timing of changes in market interest rates. Data shown is as of year-end, and one-day figures can be distorted by temporary swings in assets or liabilities.

Various techniques are utilized to quantify and monitor risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets, liabilities and derivative contracts. 

Earnings-at-risk Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, we replaced net interest income simulation modeling with earnings-at-risk in our ALCO reporting as we now employ earnings-at-risk as part of our approach towards interest rate risk management. Earnings-at-risk is a measure of interest rate risk in the banking book generated by our non-trading assets and liabilities that primarily includes loans, deposits with banks, investment securities, deposits, long-term debt and any associated interest rate hedges that are not held for trading intent or in order to hedge positions held with trading intent. As a result, we no longer utilize net interest income simulation modeling to manage interest rate risk. Earnings-at-risk utilizes a number of interest rate scenarios to estimate the impact on projected banking book net interest income over a twelve month period, such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by 100 basis points, as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by 100 basis points. In the gradual scenarios, 25 percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter. The following table reflects the estimated impact of the earnings-at-risk scenarios on projected banking book net interest income: 

##TABLE_START December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Amount % Amount % &#160; (dollars are in millions) Estimated increase (decrease) in projected banking book net interest income (reflects projected rate movements on January 1, 2024 and 2023, respectively):

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

Projected earnings-at-risk figures represent the effect of movements in banking book net interest income based on our current interest rate risk profile and the projected yield curve scenarios, which incorporate assumptions of deposit pricing, loans spreads and mortgage prepayment behavior implied by the yield curves in each scenario. This effect, however, does not incorporate actions which would probably be taken by Markets Treasury or in the businesses to mitigate the effect of interest rate risk. In reality, Markets Treasury seeks proactively to change the interest rate risk profile to minimize losses and optimize net revenues. The earnings-at-risk calculations assume that interest rates of all maturities move by the same amount in the 'up-shock' scenarios. However, certain interest rates are subject to flooring assumptions in the 'down-shock' scenarios. In addition, the calculations take account of the effect on banking book net interest income of anticipated differences in changes between interbank interest rates and interest rates over which we have discretion in terms of the timing and extent of rate changes. Deposit pricing sensitivities (i.e., deposit betas) are informed by historical and expected behavior. The projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality, size and composition of the balance sheet. Therefore, although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity, actual results will differ from these estimates, possibly by significant amounts. 

Interest rate risk behavioralization Unlike liquidity risk which is assessed on the basis of a very severe stress scenario, interest rate risk is assessed and managed according to business-as-usual conditions. In many cases the contractual profile of our assets and liabilities does not reflect the behavior observed. Behavioralization is therefore used to assess the interest rate risk of our assets and liabilities, and this assessed risk is transferred to Markets Treasury in accordance with the rules governing the transfer of interest rate risk from the global businesses to Markets Treasury. 

Behavioralization is applied in three key areas: 

&#8226; the assessed re-pricing frequency of managed rate balances; 

&#8226; the assessed duration of non-interest bearing balances, typically capital and current accounts; and 

&#8226; the base case expected prepayment behavior or pipeline take-up rate for fixed rate balances with embedded optionality. 

Interest rate behavioralization policies have to be formulated in line with the HSBC Group's behavioralization policies and approved at least annually by ALCO and global Asset, Liability and Capital Management, in conjunction with local, regional and HSBC Group risk monitoring teams. 

The extent to which balances can be behavioralized is driven by: 

&#8226; the amount of the current balance that can be assessed as stable under business-as-usual conditions; and 

&#8226; for managed rate balances the historic market interest rate re-pricing behavior observed; or 

&#8226; for non-interest bearing balances the duration for which the balance is expected to remain under business-as-usual conditions. This assessment is often driven by the re-investment tenors available to Markets Treasury to neutralize the risk through the use of fixed rate government bonds or interest rate derivatives, and for derivatives the availability of cash flow hedging capacity. 

Non-trading value at risk ("VaR") Non-trading VaR predominantly relates to Markets Treasury and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value (which includes available-for-sale and held-to-maturity assets) and associated hedges. Our investment portfolio holdings comprise mainly U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. Our non-trading VaR exposure is driven by interest rates and agency mortgage-backed security spread volatility. Refer to "Market Risk Management" below for further discussion regarding VaR and the management of market risk in our non-trading portfolios. 

Non-trading VaR at December 31, 2023 was higher as compared with December 31, 2022 due primarily to a combination of higher yields and yield volatility in the two-year VaR historical time series.

(1) Refer to the Trading VaR table in "Market Risk Management" below for additional information. 

Non-trading VaR also includes the interest rate risk of non-trading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into Markets Treasury which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it. Interest rate swaps used by Markets Treasury to hedge the interest rate risk of the investment portfolio and transfer price risk from the banking book are typically classified as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge and included within our non-trading VaR. In case there is residual market risk that cannot be efficiently and conveniently hedged by Markets Treasury they are managed by ALCO in segregated ALCO books. 

Pension risk is a component of treasury risk and represents the risk of increased costs from offering post-employment benefit plans to our employees. Certain employees are eligible to participate in the HSBC North America qualified defined benefit pension plan which has been frozen. Plan assets were higher than projected plan liabilities resulting in an over-funded status of approximately $272 million at December 31, 2023. Because these obligations relate to the HSBC North America pension plan, only a portion of any future deficit could be considered our responsibility. We and other HSBC North America affiliates with employees participating in this plan will be required to make up any shortfall over a number of years as specified under the Pension Protection Act. This can be accomplished through direct contributions, appreciation in plan assets and/or increases in market-driven discount rates resulting in lower liability valuations. See Note 22, "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the HSBC North America defined benefit plan. 

Market Risk Management Exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios: 

&#8226; Trading portfolios comprise positions held for client servicing and market-making, with the intention of short-term resale and/or to hedge risks resulting from such positions. 

&#8226; Non-trading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities as well as financial investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. 

We apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and non-trading portfolios. Our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite. 

The nature of the hedging and risk mitigation strategies performed corresponds to the market risk management instruments available. These strategies range from the use of traditional market instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to more sophisticated hedging strategies to address a combination of risk factors arising at the portfolio level. 

Market risk governance Market risk is managed and controlled through limits approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and the RMM, as well as the various businesses, and also ratified by the HSBC Group Risk Management Meeting. These limits are allocated across business lines and to the HSBC Group legal entities, including HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA. 

We have an independent market risk management and control function in North America which is responsible for setting the risk appetite, measuring market risk exposures in accordance with the policies defined by HSBC Group Risk, and monitoring and reporting these exposures against the prescribed limits on a daily basis. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

Model risk is governed through model oversight forums at the regional and global levels. The forums have direct oversight and approval responsibility for all traded risk models utilized for risk measurement and management and stress testing. They prioritize the development of models, methodologies and practices used for traded risk management and ensure that they remain within our risk appetite and business plans. We are committed to the ongoing development and enhancement of our in-house risk models subject to regulatory approval. Refer to "Model Risk Management" below for further discussion regarding the management and monitoring of model risk across North America. 

Our control of market risk in the trading and non-trading portfolios is based on a policy of restricting operations to trading within a list of permissible instruments ultimately approved by HSBC Group Risk as well as enforcing new product approval procedures through a dedicated committee. 

Market risk measures We use a range of tools to monitor and limit market risk exposures, including: 

Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis measures the impact of individual market factor movements on specific instruments or portfolios, for example the impact of a one basis point change in the yield curve. We use sensitivity analysis to monitor the market risk positions within each risk type. Sensitivity limits are set for portfolios, products and risk types, with the depth of the market being one of the principal factors in determining the level of limits set. 

Value at risk ("VaR") VaR is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence. The use of VaR is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them. In addition, we calculate VaR for non-trading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk. Where we do not calculate VaR explicitly, we use alternative tools as summarized in the 'Stress Testing' section below. 

Our VaR models are predominantly based on historical simulation which incorporates the following features: 

&#8226; historical market rates and prices are calculated with reference to foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates and the associated volatilities; 

&#8226; potential market movements utilized for VaR are calculated with reference to data from the past two years; 

&#8226; scenario profit and losses are calculated utilizing the market scenarios for all relevant risk factors; and 

&#8226; VaR measures are calculated to a 99 percent confidence level and use a one-day holding period. 

The models also incorporate the effect of option features on the underlying exposures. The nature of the VaR models means that an increase in observed market volatility will lead to an increase in VaR without any changes in the underlying positions. 

Although a valuable guide to risk, VaR should always be viewed in the context of its limitations. For example: 

&#8226; the use of historical data as a proxy for estimating future events may not encompass all potential events, particularly those which are extreme in nature; 

&#8226; the use of a holding period assumes that all positions can be liquidated or the risks offset during that period, which may not fully reflect the market risk arising at times of severe illiquidity, when the holding period may be insufficient to liquidate or hedge all positions fully; 

&#8226; the use of a 99 percent confidence level does not take into account losses that might occur beyond this level of confidence; and 

&#8226; VaR is calculated on the basis of exposures outstanding at the close of business and therefore does not necessarily reflect intra-day exposures. 

The risks not in VaR ("RNIV") framework aims to capture and capitalize material market risks that are not adequately covered in the VaR model. Risk factors are reviewed on a regular basis and either incorporated directly in the VaR models, where possible, or quantified through the RNIV. RNIV stresses interest rate basis risk exposure and interest rate volatility skewness. RNIV risk-weighted assets make up approximately 1 percent of HUSI market risk risk-weighted assets and the contribution to total HUSI risk-weighted assets remains immaterial. 

Stressed VaR Stressed VaR is primarily used for regulatory capital purposes and is integrated into the risk management process to facilitate efficient capital management. Stressed VaR complements other risk measures by providing severe potential losses associated with stressed market conditions. Stressed VaR modeling follows the same approach as VaR, except Stressed VaR calculates potential loss at a 99 percent confidence level for a one-day holding period based on a one year historical period that is calibrated to the most volatile period for the trading portfolio. 

Stress testing Stress testing is an important procedure that is integrated into our market risk management framework to evaluate the potential impact on portfolio values of more extreme, although plausible, events or movements in a set of financial variables. In such scenarios, losses can be much greater than those predicted by VaR modeling. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

A set of scenarios is used consistently across the HSBC Group. Scenarios are tailored to capture the relevant potential events or market movements at each level. The risk appetite around potential stress losses is set and monitored against corresponding limits. 

The process is governed by the Stress Testing Review Group forum which, in conjunction with regional risk management, determines the scenarios to be applied. Main scenario types are as follows: 

&#8226; single risk factor stress scenarios that are unlikely to be captured within the VaR models, such as the break of a currency peg; 

&#8226; technical scenarios that incorporate the largest move in each risk factor independent from any underlying market correlation; 

&#8226; hypothetical scenarios are mainly built on potential macroeconomic events, for example, a worsening global energy crisis and the potential effects of a sovereign debt default, including its wider contagion effects, curves steepening or flattening scenarios; and 

&#8226; historical scenarios which incorporate past observations of market movements during periods of stress which are not captured within VaR. 

Market risk reverse stress tests are undertaken on the premise that there is a fixed loss. The stress testing process identifies which scenarios lead to this loss. The rationale behind the reverse stress test is to understand scenarios which are beyond normal business conditions and could have contagion and systemic implications. 

Stressed VaR and stress testing, together with reverse stress testing, provide management with insights regarding the 'tail risk' beyond VaR, for which our appetite is limited. 

Market risk in 2023 The global market environment remained volatile in 2023, centered around central bank policy actions, economic data and stress in the banking sector which was especially prevalent in the first half of the year. The FRB raised its policy rate by 100 basis points during the year leading to volatility in the fixed income markets. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield traded within a broad range, ending the year nearly unchanged at 3.9 percent, but hitting a high of 5.0 percent and a low of 3.3 percent, exemplifying the market volatility. Credit markets remained strong, however certain sectors came under pressure like regional banks, certain pockets of technology and other high-yielding credits. 

Trading VaR Trading VaR is generated principally from trading activities within the MSS segment of GBM. These include positions in interest rates, foreign exchange, precious metals (i.e., gold, silver, platinum) and credit default swaps. In September 2023, we entered into derivative transactions to transfer the substantial majority of the market risk associated with our precious metals trading positions to HSBC Bank plc, where it will be centrally managed going forward. 

Trading VaR at December 31, 2023 was lower as compared with December 31, 2022 due to the transfer of precious metal market risk to HSBC Bank plc as discussed above as well as changes in market conditions that favor reduced overall risk exposure.

(1) Portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types. It represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types, for example, foreign exchange, interest rate and credit spread, together in one portfolio. It is measured as the difference between the sum of the VaR by individual risk type and the combined total VaR. A negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification. As the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types, it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures. 

(2) The total VaR is non-additive across risk types due to diversification effects. For presentation purposes, portfolio diversification of the VaR for trading portfolios includes VaR-based risk-not-in-VaR. 

Refer to "Treasury Risk Management" above for disclosure of our non-trading VaR. 

Back-testing We routinely validate the accuracy of our VaR models by back-testing them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes non-modeled items such as fees, commissions and revenues of intra-day transactions from the actual reported profit and loss. We would expect, under stable market conditions, to experience two or three losses in excess of VaR at the 99 percent confidence level over a one-year period. However, in periods of unstable market conditions, we could see an increase in the number of back-testing exceptions. 

During 2023, we experienced one loss back-testing exception in the fourth quarter due primarily to increased market volatility in interest rates and credit spreads.

Climate Risk Management Climate risk can materialize through physical risk, transition risk and climate-related greenwashing risk. Physical risk arises from the increased frequency and severity of weather events, such as hurricanes and floods, or chronic shifts in weather patterns. Transition risk arises from the process of moving to a low-carbon economy, including changes in government or public policy, technology and end-demand. Climate-related greenwashing risk is a thematic risk that arises from the act of knowingly or unknowingly misleading stakeholders regarding our strategy relating to climate, the climate impact/benefits of a product or service, or the climate commitments or performance of our customers. 

A climate risk focused working group was established in 2022 to identify and escalate climate risk issues to the CRO, the RMM and to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. This working group was enhanced in 2023 to include all lines of business and all LoDs. Climate risk management matters are governed principally through the RMM and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The RMM has a standing agenda item for climate risk topics. Governance around these risks continues to evolve. 

We have assessed climate risk across our existing risk taxonomy, and are incorporating it within the risk management framework through enhancement of policies and controls for the existing risks, where appropriate. Our climate risk approach is aligned to our risk management framework and Three LoD model, which sets out how we identify, assess, and manage our 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

risks. This approach promotes that the Board of Directors and senior management understand and take action to manage key climate risks. 

Our dedicated climate risk program continues to support the development of our climate risk management capabilities. The key achievements in 2023 included: 

&#8226; continued enhancing our climate risk management approach across our risk taxonomy; 

&#8226; provided additional climate-related training for senior leaders and employees, including a relaunch of HSBC's global sustainability learning and resource portal that increased the availability of training to the broader workforce; and 

&#8226; continued to evolve metrics to monitor climate risk. 

Climate risk should be considered part of the broader sustainability risks that also cover risks related to wider environmental, social and governance considerations. The HSBC Group has specific sustainability risk policies covering thermal coal phase-out, agricultural commodities, chemicals, energy, forestry, mining and metals, UNESCO World Heritage Sites and Ramsar-designated wetlands. The HSBC Group also applies the Equator Principles when financing projects. In December 2022, the HSBC Group revised its Energy Policy to support their transition to net zero in the future. During 2023, we implemented this policy into our applicable lines of business. The HSBC Group will continue to engage with clients, where relevant, and support them in an effort to adopt more sustainable practices. Our network of sustainability risk managers supports the implementation of these policies. These sustainability risk managers are supported by reputational and sustainability risk professionals across the HSBC Group. 

Resilience Risk Management Resilience risk arises from failures or inadequacies in processes, people, systems or external events. Operational resilience is our ability to anticipate, prevent, adapt, respond to, recover and learn from internal or external disruption while minimizing customer and market impact. Resilience is determined by assessing whether we are able to continue to provide our important business services, within an agreed level. We accept that we will not be able to prevent all disruption, but we prioritize investment to continuously improve our response and recovery strategies for our most important business services. 

The Operational and Resilience Risk sub-function provides robust non-financial risk steward oversight of our businesses, functions, and critical business services, supported by effective and timely independent challenge. It provides guidance and stewardship about how we can prevent, adapt, and learn from resilience-related threats when something goes wrong. The Operational and Resilience Risk target operating model provides a consistent view across resilience risks, strengthening our risk management oversight while operating effectively as part of a simplified non-financial risk structure. We view resilience risk across several risk types related to: third-party risk; technology and cybersecurity risk; transaction processing; business interruption and incident risk; data risk; change execution risk; and facilities availability, safety and security. 

The operational and resilience risk stewards actively provide day-to-day oversight and periodic assurance to the businesses which may result in challenges being raised. We continue to prioritize our efforts on material risks and areas undergoing strategic growth. Operational and resilience risk matters are governed principally through the RMM and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. 

Technology and cybersecurity risk The security of our information and technology infrastructure is crucial for maintaining our applications and processes while protecting our customers and the HSBC brand. In common with other financial institutions and multinational organizations, we face a growing threat of cyberattacks that continue to increase in sophistication. A failure of our defenses against such attacks could result in financial loss or the loss of customer data or other sensitive information which could undermine both our reputation and our ability to attract and retain our customers. As discussed above, cybersecurity risk is overseen by the Operational and Resilience Risk sub-function, with regular reporting of cyber risks to the RMM and the Board of Directors by both the First and Second LoD. For more information, see Item 1C, "Cybersecurity," in this Form 10-K. We continue to mature our cyber intelligence capabilities as the cyber threat landscape evolves. These intelligence monitoring capabilities increase our agility and ability to respond with increased detection and response capabilities reducing potential exposure to cyber threats. Regulation continues to increase from multiple jurisdictions and perspectives, and is at times deployed without coordination with other regulators. HSBC is engaged with peer institutions and, in conjunction with them and the Cyber Risk Institute ("CRI"), developed a CRI Profile which is recognized within the United States and globally. As part of this forum, we continue to meet with various U.S. regulators (e.g., the OCC, FRB, FDIC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, New York State Department of Financial Services, etc.) and other financial institutions to progress acceptance and utilization of the CRI Profile to address regulatory harmonization as it relates to cyber and information security. Cybersecurity will continue to be a strong focus of ongoing initiatives to strengthen the control environment and our readiness to respond in the event of an attack. 

Regulatory Compliance Risk Management &#160; Regulatory compliance risk arises from the failure to observe relevant laws, codes, rules and regulations and can manifest itself in poor market or customer outcomes and lead to fines, penalties and reputational damage to our business. Regulatory compliance risk is measured by reference to identified metrics, key risk indicators, testing 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

of controls by the three LoDs, employee feedback, customer complaints and through regulatory feedback. Regulatory compliance risks are assessed through detailed assessments and reported to the RMM and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors through the reporting of RAS metrics and the Regulatory Compliance Enterprise Risk Assessment report. Regulatory compliance risk is managed by establishing and communicating appropriate policies and procedures, training employees in regulatory requirements, establishing controls, and monitoring and testing controls to help ensure that the regulatory requirements are being adhered to. Proactive assessment and enhancement of controls is undertaken where required. 

The Second LoD risk stewards provide independent, objective oversight and challenge and promote a compliance-oriented culture, supporting the businesses in delivering fair outcomes for customers, maintaining the integrity of financial markets and achieving our strategic objectives. Any actual or potential regulatory breaches require prompt identification and escalation to the Regulatory Compliance function or other applicable risk stewards. Any major breaches, gaps, issues and emerging risks are escalated to the RMM and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, as appropriate. 

The Compliance function oversees the management of regulatory compliance risk for laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards that align under its scope of oversight as the Second LoD risk steward. As a Board of Directors committee, the Risk Committee oversees our compliance risk management program (both Regulatory Compliance and Financial Crime Risk) as well as fiduciary matters as discussed further below. 

Fiduciary risk is a component of regulatory compliance risk and represents the risk of breaching fiduciary duties where we act in a fiduciary capacity as trustee, investment manager or as mandated by law or regulation. It is the risk associated with failing to offer services honestly and properly to clients in that capacity. Fiduciary risks reside in our WPB businesses (such as Investment Management, Personal Trust, Security Operation Services) and other business lines outside of WPB (such as Corporate Trust). The Risk Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight responsibility of the management of fiduciary risk. The Risk Committee has delegated day-to-day management and oversight responsibilities to management, whose primary oversight body for management of fiduciary activity is the Fiduciary Risk Management Meeting, chaired by the U.S. Head of Enterprise Compliance. The U.S. Head of Enterprise Compliance reports to the U.S. Chief Compliance Officer. 

Financial Crime Risk Management Financial crime risk management is the framework in place to identify and deter potential illegal activity from occurring by, at, or through the HSBC Group. It is embedded in our day-to-day operations and culture. 

The Financial Crime function ("FC") is led by the U.S. Head of Financial Crime, who reports to the U.S. Chief Compliance Officer. FC provides oversight to enable us to build on our achievements in managing financial crime risk effectively and to continue to strengthen financial crime detection, and anti-money laundering, sanctions, fraud, tax evasion and anti-bribery and corruption compliance. We use a Financial Crime Risk Management Information Dashboard, the RAS, risk map, and top and emerging risk process to monitor risk and performance indicators of financial crime, including trends and potential gaps in the management of financial crime risk that require attention. On an annual basis, we perform an enterprise-wide risk assessment of financial crime. Any major breaches, gaps, issues and emerging risks are escalated to the RMM and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, as appropriate. 

Compliance continues to proactively identify, analyze and investigate financial crime risk and ensure proper mitigation of these risks. It embeds policies and procedures, introduces new technology solutions, and supports a culture of compliance needed to effectively manage financial crime risk. 

Strategic Risk Management Strategic risk may be mitigated by consideration of the potential opportunities and challenges through the strategic planning process. This risk is also a function of the compatibility of our strategic goals, the business strategies developed to achieve those goals, the resources deployed against those goals and the quality of implementation. 

We have established a strong internal control structure to minimize the impact of strategic risk to our earnings and capital. All changes in strategy as well as the process in which new strategies are implemented are subject to detailed reviews and approvals at business line, functional, regional, board and HSBC levels. This process is monitored by the Strategy and Planning function to ensure compliance with our policies and standards. 

Reputational risk is a component of strategic risk and represents the risk arising from failure to meet stakeholder expectations as a result of any event, behavior, action or inaction, either by us, our employees, the HSBC Group or those with whom it is associated, that may cause stakeholders to form a negative view of us. Reputational risk relates to stakeholders' perceptions, whether based on fact or otherwise. Stakeholder expectations are constantly changing and thus, reputational risk is dynamic and will differ between geographies, groups and individuals. This might also result in financial or non-financial impacts, loss of confidence or other consequences. The safeguarding of our reputation is of paramount importance to our continued prosperity and is the responsibility of every member of our staff. Reputational risk can arise from social, ethical or environmental issues, or as a consequence of operational and other risk events. Our good reputation depends upon the way in which we conduct our business, but can also be affected by the way in which customers to whom we provide financial services conduct themselves. 

We tolerate a limited degree of reputational risk arising from business activities or association where foreseeable reputational risk has been escalated to the appropriate level of management, carefully considered and/or mitigated and is determined to fall 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. ##TABLE_END

to acceptable risk thresholds as defined by the HSBC Group risk appetite statement. Since reputational risk can arise from all aspects of operations and activities, all businesses and functions are required to articulate and track reputational risk. 

Reputational risk is considered and assessed by the HSBC Group Executive Committee, the HSBC Group, and senior management. The Risk Committee of the Board of Directors reviews, with senior management, and as appropriate, approves guidelines and policies related to the process for assessing and managing risk topics, including reputational risk. These policies, which are an integral part of the internal control systems, are communicated through manuals and statements of policy, internal communication and training. The policies form the basis for operational procedures, as well as consideration of reputational risk in areas including money laundering deterrence, economic sanctions, environmental impact, anti-corruption measures, employee relations, inappropriate market conduct and breach of regulatory duty and requirements. In addition, we continue to review our internal control structure to minimize the risk of operational and financial failure and to ensure that a full appraisal of reputational risk is made before strategic decisions are taken. 

The RMM provides governance and oversight of reputational risk. Additionally, each business reviews transactions and customers that may adversely affect our public perception via their RRCSC. The RRCSCs are chaired by a senior executive and comprise senior members from the business, risk, legal, financial crime and compliance departments and other invited parties. The RRCSCs are responsible for reviewing the individual merits and involved parties in higher-risk transactions, and approving or declining customer relationships and transactions based on the potential risks to us. In addition to the RRCSCs, the responsibility of the practical implementation of such policies and the compliance with the letter and spirit of them rests with our CEO and senior management of our businesses. 

Model Risk Management In order to manage the risk of inappropriate or incorrect business decisions (e.g., customer conduct, financial crime, pricing, profit &#38; loss and balance sheet and capital reporting, etc.) arising from the use of models that have been inadequately designed, implemented or used, or from models that do not perform in line with expectations and predictions, a comprehensive model risk management framework has been established that provides oversight and challenge to all models across HSBC North America. The framework includes a Model Risk Policy that aligns with model risk management regulations. A model inventory is maintained and updated. In addition, model risk appetite measures are used to manage and monitor model risk. Model risk is managed on an ongoing basis as part of a Model Risk Committee, which is chaired by the CRO with representation from businesses and functions. The Model Risk Management function is responsible for providing effective challenge to and approval of models implemented for use within HSBC North America. Model risk controls that form the basis for model risk control assessments have been implemented for all of our businesses and functions and are being used to manage and mitigate model risk.
