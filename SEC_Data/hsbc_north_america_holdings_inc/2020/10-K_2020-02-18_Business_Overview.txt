Organization History 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

##TABLE_END

HSBC USA Inc. ("HSBC USA"), incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland in 1973 as Republic New York Corporation, was acquired through a series of transactions by HSBC Holdings plc ("HSBC" and, together with its subsidiaries, "HSBC Group") and later changed its name to "HSBC USA Inc.". HSBC USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America Holdings Inc. ("HSBC North America"), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC. HSBC USA's principal business is to act as a holding company for its subsidiaries. In this Form 10-K, HSBC USA and its subsidiaries are referred to as "HUSI," "we," "us" and "our." 

HSBC Group 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

##TABLE_END

HSBC Group aims to be the world's preeminent international bank and is a leading provider of transactional banking products and services with a geographical network which provides clients and investors access to what it believes are the most attractive growth opportunities. HSBC seeks growth where the opportunities best align with its strengths, focused on enabling and supporting business and trade between the developed world and the faster growing, higher returning markets of the world, particularly in Asia and the Middle East. However, the more challenging economic environment requires strategic changes in order to increase returns and create capacity for future growth. These strategic changes include materially reshaping underperforming areas of HSBC Group, particularly in Global Banking and Markets, in Europe, and in the United States. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview - 2020 Business Update." 

HSBC North America Operations 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

##TABLE_END

HSBC North America is the holding company for HSBC Group's operations in the United States. The principal subsidiaries of HSBC North America at December 31, 2019 &#32;were HSBC USA, HSBC Markets (USA) Inc. ("HMUS"), a holding company for certain subsidiaries primarily associated with global banking and markets businesses, and HSBC Technology &#38; Services (USA) Inc. ("HTSU"), a provider of information technology and centralized operational and support services including human resources, tax, finance, compliance, legal, corporate affairs and other services shared among the subsidiaries of HSBC North America and the HSBC Group. HSBC USA's principal U.S. banking subsidiary is HSBC Bank USA, National Association (together with its subsidiaries, "HSBC Bank USA"). Under the oversight of HSBC North America, HUSI works with its affiliates to maximize opportunities and efficiencies in HSBC Group's operations in the United States. These affiliates do so by providing each other with, among other things, alternative sources of liquidity to fund operations and expertise in specialized corporate functions and services through the pooling of resources within HTSU to provide shared, allocated support functions to all of HSBC North America's subsidiaries. In addition, clients of HSBC Bank USA and other affiliates are investors in debt issued by HSBC USA and/or HSBC Bank USA, providing significant sources of liquidity and capital to both entities. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. ("HSI"), a registered broker dealer and a subsidiary of HMUS, generally leads or participates as underwriter of all HUSI domestic issuances of term debt. While neither HSBC USA nor HSBC Bank USA has received advantaged pricing, the underwriting fees and commissions paid to HSI historically have benefited the HSBC Group.

Our Corporate Center ("CC") is comprised of certain centralized activities and functions such as Balance Sheet Management ("BSM") and our legacy structured credit products in order to better reflect the way we manage our businesses. 

##TABLE_END HSBC Bank USA, HSBC USA's principal U.S. banking subsidiary, is a national banking association. Through HSBC Bank USA, we offer our customers a full range of commercial and consumer banking products and related financial services. HSBC Bank USA is also an international dealer in derivative instruments denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies, focusing on structuring transactions to meet clients' needs. 

In 2005, HSBC USA incorporated a nationally chartered limited purpose bank subsidiary, HSBC Trust Company (Delaware), National Association ("HTCD"), the primary activities of which are providing personal trust services. The impact of HTCD's operations on HSBC USA's consolidated balance sheets and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 &#32;and 2017 &#32;was not material. 

We report financial information to our ultimate parent, HSBC, in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") and endorsed by the European Union ("EU"). As a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of HSBC Group's accounting and reporting policies ("Group Reporting Basis"). We continue, however, to monitor capital adequacy and report to regulatory agencies in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). For additional financial information relating to our business and operating segments as well as a summary of the significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results, see Note 24, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of our current strategy and how it may impact each of the businesses described below, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview - 2020 Business Update." 

Retail Banking and Wealth Management Segment Our RBWM segment provides a range of banking and wealth products and services to individuals and small businesses through our branches and on-line channels to individuals and certain small businesses. Banking services are provided through HSBC Bank USA, securities services and annuities are provided through our affiliate HSI and additional insurance products are offered through the bank's subsidiary, HSBC Insurance Agency (USA) Inc. These services include asset-driven services such as credit and lending, liability-driven services such as deposit taking and account services and fee or commission driven services such as investment advisory and securities brokerage, as well as the sale of certain third-party insurance solutions. RBWM is focused on growing its wealth and banking business in key urban centers with strong international connectivity across the U.S. including New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and Washington DC.

Supporting our three client groups is our International Subsidiary Banking team which provides solutions to international subsidiaries operating in the US. We also have a specialized Commercial Real Estate group which focuses on selective business opportunities in markets where we have strong portfolio expertise. This structure allows us to align our resources in order to efficiently deliver suitable products and services based on our clients' needs and abilities. Global Liquidity and Cash Management, Global Trade and Receivables Finance, Lending and Transaction Management, Global Banking and Global Markets are key product groups that CMB partners with to deliver the global connections and related products and services required by customers. Whether it is through commercial centers, the retail branch network, or via HSBC net , our online banking channel , &#32;CMB provides customers with the products and services needed to grow their businesses internationally and delivers those products and services through its relationship managers who operate within a robust, customer focused compliance and risk culture, and collaborate across HSBC to capture a larger percentage of a relationship. 

Global Banking and Markets Segment Our GB&#38;M business segment supports HSBC's global strategy by leveraging the HSBC Group's advantages and scale, strength in developed and emerging markets and product expertise in order to focus on delivering international products to U.S. clients and local products to international clients, with New York as the hub for the Americas business, including Canada and Latin America. GB&#38;M provides tailored financial solutions to major government, corporate and institutional clients as well as private investors worldwide. GB&#38;M clients are served by sector-focused teams that bring together relationship managers and product specialists to develop financial solutions that meet individual client needs. With a focus on providing client connectivity between the emerging markets and developed markets, GB&#38;M aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc.

each client's financial requirements with a long-term relationship management approach. In addition to GB&#38;M clients, GB&#38;M also provides financial solutions to RBWM, CMB and PB clients where those clients have needs that require the product set that GB&#38;M has available. 

Within client-focused business lines, GB&#38;M offers a full range of capabilities, including: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Banking and financing advice and solutions for sovereign, corporate and institutional clients, including loans, working capital, trade services, liquidity and cash management, leveraged and acquisition finance, project and infrastructure finance, asset finance, mergers and acquisitions advisory, as well as capital raising in the debt and equity capital markets; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

A markets business with 24-hour coverage and knowledge of world-wide local markets which provides services in credit and rates, foreign exchange, precious metals trading, equities and securities services. 

##TABLE_END Private Banking Segment PB provides a broad range of banking and investment products and services to high net worth and ultra-high net worth individuals and families with a focus on multi-generational families, business executives and entrepreneurs who require sophisticated solutions to help meet their most complex needs domestically and abroad, with many clients sourced in collaboration with our other business lines. PB works with its clients to offer tailored, coordinated and innovative ways to manage and preserve wealth while optimizing returns. PB offers a wide range of products and services, including banking, liquidity management, investment services, custody, tailored lending, trust and fiduciary services, insurance, family wealth and philanthropy advisory services. PB also works to ensure that its clients have access to other products and services available throughout the HSBC Group, such as credit cards and investment banking, to deliver total solutions for their financial and wealth needs. 

Corporate Center Segment &#32;&#32;CC includes BSM, our legacy structured credit products, certain corporate function costs, certain debt issued for which fair value option accounting was elected and related derivatives, certain affiliate transactions, tax credit investments and adjustments to the fair value of HSBC shares held for stock plans. Prior to 2018, CC also included costs to achieve (representing costs incurred to deliver the cost reduction and productivity outcomes previously outlined by HSBC) as well as our legacy residential mortgage activities, including a portfolio of residential mortgage loans that we previously purchased from HSBC Finance Corporation ("HSBC Finance") and certain residential mortgage servicing activities performed on behalf of HSBC Finance. 

BSM is responsible for managing liquidity and funding under the supervision of our Asset and Liability Management Committee. BSM also manages our structural interest rate position within a limit structure. The majority of the liquidity is invested in interest bearing deposits with Federal Reserve banks and U.S. Government and other high quality securities. BSM is permitted to use derivatives as part of its mandate to manage interest rate risk. Derivative activity is predominantly comprised of the use of traditional interest rate swaps which are part of cash flow hedging relationships. Credit risk in BSM is predominantly limited to short-term exposure created by exposure to banks as well as high quality sovereigns or agencies which constitute the majority of BSM's liquidity portfolio. BSM manages interest rate risk and liquidity risk. 

Funding 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

##TABLE_END

We fund our operations using a diversified deposit base, supplemented by issuing short-term and long-term unsecured debt, secured financing repurchase agreements utilizing High Quality Liquid Assets ("HQLA"), accessing the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, issuing preferred equity, and, as necessary, receiving capital contributions from our parent, HSBC North America. Emphasis is placed on maintaining stable deposit balances. In 2019 , our primary source of funds continued to be deposits, augmented by issuances of commercial paper, securities sold under repurchase agreements and term debt. 

Numerous factors, both internal and external, may impact our access to, and the costs associated with, both retail and wholesale sources of funding. These factors may include our debt ratings, overall economic conditions, overall capital markets volatility, the counterparty credit limits of investors to the HSBC Group, and our management of the credit risks inherent in our business and customer base. 

A detailed description of our sources and availability of funding are set forth in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" and "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Credit Derivatives and Other Contractual Obligations" sections of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&#38;A"). 

The cash generated by these funding sources is primarily used to service our debt obligations, originate new loans, purchase investment securities, pay preferred dividends and, as available and appropriate, common dividends to our parent.

Regulation and Competition 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

##TABLE_END

Regulation We are subject to, among other things, an extensive statutory and regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies, financial holding companies and banks. U.S. regulation of banks, bank holding companies and financial holding companies is intended primarily for safety and soundness of banks, and the protection of the interests of depositors, the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and the banking system as a whole rather than the protection of security holders and creditors. Events since early 2008 affecting the financial services industry and, more generally, the financial markets and the economy have led to a significant number of initiatives regarding reform of the financial services industry and the regulation governing the industry. 

Bank Holding Company Supervision As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended ("BHC Act"), and to inspection, examination and supervision by our primary regulator, the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB"). We are also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). 

Financial Holding Company Regulation &#32;&#32;HSBC USA and its parent bank holding companies qualified as financial holding companies pursuant to the amendments to the BHC Act effected by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 ("GLB Act"). Financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of activities than bank holding companies. Under regulations implemented by the FRB, if any financial holding company, or any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company, ceases to meet certain capital or management standards, the FRB may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the financial holding company and place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies. In addition, the FRB may require divestiture of the holding company's depository institutions or its affiliates engaged in broader financial activities in reliance on the GLB Act if the deficiencies persist. The regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the "CRA"), as amended, the FRB must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. 

In 2018, the FRB finalized revisions to its supervisory rating system for intermediate holding companies and large bank holding companies with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, including HSBC North America and HSBC USA. Under the revised ratings system, covered bank holding companies receive separate ratings from the FRB for (i) capital planning and positions, (ii) liquidity risk management and positions, and (iii) governance and controls. A covered bank holding company that receives a deficient rating for any of the three components is not considered to be "well managed." 

We are generally prohibited under the BHC Act from acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of more than five percent of any class of voting shares of, or substantially all the assets of, or exercising control over, any U.S. bank, bank holding company or many other types of depository institutions and/or their holding companies without the prior approval of the FRB and, potentially, other U.S. banking regulatory agencies. 

The GLB Act and the regulations issued thereunder contain a number of other provisions that affect our operations and those of our subsidiary banks, including regulations and restrictions on the activities we may conduct and the types of businesses and entities we may acquire. Furthermore, other provisions contain detailed requirements relating to the financial privacy of consumers. In addition, the so-called 'push-out' provisions of the GLB Act removed the blanket exemption from registration for securities and brokerage activities conducted in banks (including HSBC Bank USA) under the Exchange Act. Applicable regulations allow banks to continue to avoid registration as a broker or dealer only if they conduct securities activities that fall within a set of defined exemptions. 

Consumer Regulation &#160; Our consumer businesses operate in a highly regulated environment. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act" or "Dodd-Frank") created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB"), which has a broad range of powers to administer and enforce a federal regulatory framework of consumer financial regulation, including the authority to regulate credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services and providers of those products and services. The CFPB has the authority to issue regulations to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

acts or practices in connection with consumer financial products or services and to ensure features of any consumer financial products or services are fully, accurately and effectively disclosed to consumers. The CFPB also has authority to examine large banks, including HSBC Bank USA, and their affiliates for compliance with those regulations. Our consumer lending businesses are also subject to additional laws relating to consumer protection including, without limitation, fair lending, fair debt collection practices, mortgage loan origination and servicing obligations, bankruptcy, military service member protections, use of credit reports, privacy matters, and disclosure of credit terms and correction of billing errors. Local, state and national regulatory and enforcement agencies continue efforts to address perceived problems within the mortgage lending and credit card industries through broad or targeted legislative or regulatory initiatives aimed at lenders' operations in consumer lending markets. There continues to be a significant amount of legislative and regulatory activity, nationally, locally and at the state level, designed to limit certain lending practices while mandating certain servicing procedures. Federal bankruptcy and state debtor relief and collection laws, as well as the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act affect the ability of banks, including HSBC Bank USA, to collect outstanding balances. 

Supervision of Bank Subsidiaries Our subsidiary national banks, HSBC Bank USA and HTCD, are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"). These subsidiary banks are subject to additional regulation and supervision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), the FRB and the CFPB. HSBC Bank USA and HTCD are subject to banking laws and regulations that place various restrictions and requirements on their activities, investments, operations and administration, including the establishment and maintenance of branch offices, capital and reserve requirements, deposits and borrowings, investment and lending activities, payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates, overall compliance and risk management and numerous other matters. 

HSBC Bank USA is subject to the CRA, which imposes affirmative, ongoing obligations on depository institutions to meet the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution. In December 2019, the OCC and FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking intended to (i) clarify which activities qualify for CRA credit; (ii) update where activities count for CRA credit; (iii) create a more transparent and objective method for measuring CRA performance; and (iv) provide for more transparent, consistent, and timely CRA-related data collection, recordkeeping, and reporting. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the CRA. 

Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks. Dividends payable by HSBC Bank USA and HTCD are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a "recent earnings" test and an "undivided profits" test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year's net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the national bank obtains the approval of the OCC. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank's undivided profits account. HSBC Bank USA is also required to maintain reserves in the form of vault cash and deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank, as well as maintain appropriate amounts of capital against its assets as discussed further in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Federal &#32; banking laws and regulations apply a variety of requirements or restrictions on insured depository institutions with respect to brokered deposits. For instance, only a "well capitalized" insured depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. &#32; In December 2019, the FDIC issued a proposed rule intended to update and modernize the FDIC's brokered deposit regulations. The proposed rule, among other things, would revise the definition of "deposit broker" and the accompanying exceptions. We are evaluating the proposed rule and its potential impact on our operations and results. 

The types of activities in which the non-U.S. branches of HSBC Bank USA may engage are subject to various restrictions imposed by the FRB in addition to those generally applicable to HSBC Bank USA under OCC rules. These branches are also subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate. 

Under longstanding FRB policy, which Dodd-Frank codified as a statutory requirement, HSBC USA is expected to act as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy. 

Affiliate Transaction Restrictions HSBC Bank USA and HTCD are subject to significant restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other "covered transactions" with HSBC USA or other affiliates. Covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit, investments and asset purchases, derivatives and certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from, or taking the credit risk by, a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate. Dodd-Frank expanded these affiliate transaction restrictions to include as a covered transaction the credit exposure of a bank to an affiliate arising from a derivative, securities lending/borrowing or repurchase transaction with an affiliate. The FRB has yet to propose rules to implement these revisions. A bank's transactions with its non-bank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm's length terms. Certain Edge Act subsidiaries of HSBC Bank USA are limited in the amount of funds they can provide to other affiliates including their parent. Amounts above their level of invested capital generally must be secured with U.S. government securities. 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

Unless an exemption applies, or a specific waiver is granted by the FRB, covered transactions by a bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 percent of the bank's capital and surplus, and all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate are limited to 20 percent of a bank's capital and surplus. Loans and extensions of credit to affiliates by a bank generally are to be secured in specified amounts with specific types of collateral. 

Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators including Basel III (the "Basel III rule"). A bank or bank holding company's failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory actions and possibly additional discretionary actions by its regulators. Generally, bank holding company regulatory capital compliance is performed at a consolidated level within the United States at HSBC North America, our parent, and also separately for HSBC Bank USA. However, we do present HSBC USA's capital ratios below in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in our MD&#38;A, as well as, together with HSBC Bank USA's, in Note 25, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our ultimate parent, HSBC, is also subject to regulatory capital requirements under United Kingdom ("U.K.") law. 

Basel III Overview The Basel III rule updated the compositions of capital and established a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio. The Basel III rule also revised minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements and added a supplementary leverage ratio ("SLR"). Under the Basel III rule, there are two methods available to calculate risk-weighted assets, the generally-applicable Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approaches, which are required in addition to the Standardized Approach for large banking organizations that meet certain thresholds. The Standardized Approach relies primarily on supervisory risk weights based on exposure type, and the Advanced Approaches determine risk weights based on internal models. 

The FRB requires certain large non-U.S. banks with significant operations in the United States, such as HSBC, to establish a single intermediate holding company ("IHC") to hold all of their U.S. bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The HSBC Group operates in the United States through such an IHC structure (i.e., HSBC North America). In accordance with FRB rules, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are not required to use the Advanced Approaches and are calculating their risk-based and leverage capital requirements solely under the Standardized Approach. 

To be categorized as "well capitalized" under the Basel III rule, a banking institution must have the ratios reflected in the table included in Note 25, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and must not be subject to a directive, order or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. The federal bank regulatory agencies may, however, set higher capital requirements for an individual bank or bank holding company when particular circumstances warrant. Under the Basel III rule, all banking organizations continue to be subject to the U.S. regulators' existing minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 percent. Additionally, certain banking organizations, such as HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, are subject to an SLR of 3 percent (calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure, which includes balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet items). 

In 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the "Relief Act") was signed into law. In October 2019, the FRB and the other federal banking agencies jointly finalized rules to implement the Relief Act that would tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards for large bank holding companies ("BHCs") and foreign banking organizations (the "Tailoring Rules"). The Tailoring Rules assign each BHC and U.S. IHC with $50 billion or more in total U.S. assets into one of five classifications (Categories I through IV, and 'other firms') based on its size and four risk-based indicators. As a Category III firm, HSBC North America and its subsidiary bank, HSBC Bank USA, is no longer considered "Advanced Approaches banking organizations." Prior to adoption of the Tailoring Rules, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA had requested and received regulatory approval to opt out of the Advanced Approaches and therefore have previously calculated and will continue to calculate their risk-based capital requirements for credit risk solely under the Standardized Approach. Under the Tailoring Rules, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA remain subject to certain other capital requirements that were previously applicable only to Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the SLR and the countercyclical capital buffer. The Tailoring Rules also permit Category III firms including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA to opt-out of the requirement to recognize most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital. The provisions of the Tailoring Rules relevant to HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA became effective January 1, 2020. 

Category III firms such as HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA will also benefit from (i) simpler capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, and (ii) a simplified treatment for the amount of capital issued by consolidated subsidiaries to third parties (generally known as minority interests) which can be included in regulatory capital. These simplifying amendments were adopted in a separate rulemaking (the "Simplifications Rule") finalized by the federal banking agencies in July 2019 and become effective April 1, 2020 although firms may choose to apply the simplifications as early as January 1, 2020. In November 2019, the federal banking agencies jointly amended the Basel III rule to implement a provision of the Relief Act by reducing the risk weighting applicable to high-volatility commercial real estate exposures. Also in November 2019, the federal banking agencies finalized a rule to include a revised standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk ("SA-CCR") to calculate total risk-weighted asset amounts for derivative transactions in addition to the existing current exposure method ("CEM"). The Tailoring Rules clarify that Category III firms and their subsidiary banks are not required to use SA-CCR to measure their derivative exposure. Instead, HSBC North 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

America and HSBC Bank USA have the option to use either SA-CCR or CEM for their risk-based capital ratios and the SLR. The federal banking agencies issued a separate proposal in April 2019 which would exclude Category III firms and their subsidiary banks from the requirement to deduct from their regulatory capital holdings of total loss absorbing capital instruments issued by other banks. We continue to evaluate the potential impacts of the Relief Act, the Tailoring Rules, the Simplification Rule and other related proposals on our operations. 

HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are required to maintain minimum capital ratios (exclusive of any countercyclical capital buffer, as explained below) as follows:

##TABLE_END

Currently, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA hold capital in excess of these regulatory minimums. 

In 2018, the FRB issued a proposal to replace the capital conservation buffer with a "stress capital buffer," which would be floored at 2.5 percent. Per the proposal, the stress capital buffer would equal (i) a bank holding company's projected decline in common equity Tier 1 under the supervisory severely adverse stress testing scenario prior to any planned capital actions, plus (ii) one year of planned common stock dividends and would be reset each year based on the bank holding company's stress testing results. We are reviewing these possible changes to the capital conservation buffer in anticipation of the formal rulemaking and their potential impact on our capital planning processes specifically and our operations and results generally. We currently target internal capital levels using an approach analogous to the stress capital buffer and, therefore, we do not expect the proposal to have a significant impact on our U.S. operations or change our capital planning processes. 

In addition, and subject to discretion by the respective regulatory authorities, a countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5 percent, consisting of common equity Tier 1 capital, could also be required to be built up by banking organizations in periods of excess credit growth in the economy, which could be more pronounced under the new guidance on expected credit losses from the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"). The FRB, in consultation with the OCC and FDIC, has affirmed the current countercyclical capital buffer level of 0 percent and noted that any future modifications to the buffer would generally be subject to a 12-month phase-in period. 

We continue to review the composition of our capital structure and capital buffers in light of these developments. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing &#32;The FRB requires IHCs and BHCs, including HSBC North America, to comply with the FRB's capital plan rule and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") program, as well as the annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the FRB, and annual company-run stress tests (with disclosure of the company-run stress tests every other year) as required under the Dodd-Frank Act (collectively, "DFAST"), as amended by the Relief Act. Beginning in 2020, HSBC Bank USA is no longer subject to the OCC's DFAST requirements, which require certain banks to conduct annual company-run stress tests. The company-run stress tests are forward looking exercises to assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB and the OCC for the annual exercise, and internally developed scenarios for both the annual and periodic exercises, on the financial condition and capital adequacy of a bank holding company or bank over a nine quarter planning horizon. 

As part of the CCAR process, the FRB undertakes a supervisory assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies, including HSBC North America, based on a review of a comprehensive capital plan submitted by each participating bank holding company to the FRB that describes the company's planned capital actions during the nine quarter review period, as well as the results of stress tests conducted by both the company and the FRB under different hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios, including a supervisory baseline scenario and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB. The FRB can object to a capital plan, in which case the company cannot make capital distributions (with the exception of those that may have already received a non-objection in the previous year) without specific FRB approval. 

The FRB considers whether under different hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios, including a severely adverse scenarios, the company would be able to maintain throughout the nine quarter planning horizon, regulatory risk-based and leverage capital ratios that exceed the minimum requirements after taking into account the company's planned capital distributions, such as dividends and stock repurchases. Failure to meet a minimum regulatory risk-based or leverage capital requirement on a projected stress basis is grounds for objection to a capital plan. 

HSBC North America submitted its latest CCAR capital plan and both HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA submitted their latest annual company-run DFAST results in April 2019. In July 2019, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA publicly 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

disclosed their latest annual DFAST results. In October 2019, HSBC North America submitted and publicly disclosed its latest periodic DFAST results. 

In June 2019, the FRB publicly disclosed its own DFAST and CCAR results and informed HSBC North America that it did not object to HSBC North America's capital plan or the planned capital distributions included in its 2019 CCAR submission. 

Under the Tailoring Rules, HSBC North America, as a Category III firm, remains subject to CCAR on an annual basis although, beginning January 1, 2020, it is no longer subject to a mid-cycle stress testing requirement and is now required to disclose its company-run stress tests only every other year. In October 2019, the OCC adopted a final rule implementing the Relief Act which eliminated the requirement to conduct company-run stress tests for national banks with less than $250 billion in total assets, such as HSBC Bank USA. 

Liquidity Risk Management The Basel Committee has adopted two required liquidity metrics: the liquidity coverage ratio ("LCR"), designed to be a short-term measure to ensure banks have sufficient HQLA to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days, and the net stable funding ratio ("NSFR"), which is a longer term measure with a 12-month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities. 

Currently, U.S. institutions, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100 percent and report their LCRs to U.S. regulators on a daily basis. In April 2016, U.S. regulators issued for public comment a proposal to implement the NSFR in the United States, applicable to certain large banking organizations, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA. 

The Tailoring Rules also reduced the LCR requirement for Category III IHCs with weighted short-term wholesale funding under $75 billion and their depository institution subsidiaries, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, from 100 to 85 percent on a daily basis beginning January 1, 2020. The Tailoring Rules also indicate that an 85 percent NSFR would apply to Category III IHCs with weighted short-term wholesale funding under $75 billion and their depository institution subsidiaries once the NSFR is finalized. As a Category III firm, HSBC North America remains subject to liquidity stress testing on a monthly basis and related liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements. 

HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have adjusted their liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA may need to make further changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future final rules. 

TLAC The U.S. IHCs of non-U.S. global systemically important banks ("G-SIBs"), including HSBC North America, must maintain minimum amounts of total loss-absorbing capacity ("TLAC"), which includes minimum levels of Tier 1 capital and long-term debt satisfying certain eligibility criteria, and a related TLAC buffer. The TLAC rules also include 'clean holding company requirements' that impose limitations on the types of financial transactions that HSBC North America may engage in. To support compliance with the TLAC rules, in 2018, HSBC North America issued additional long-term debt and modified the terms of existing debt in order to be TLAC compliant. HSBC North America will continue to assess the amount of additional long-term debt that is needed to be compliant in future periods. 

U.S. Resolution Planning &#32;&#32;Large international banks, such as HSBC (generally with regard to its U.S. operations), and large insured depository institutions, such as HSBC Bank USA, are required to file resolution plans identifying, among other things, material subsidiaries and core business lines and describing what strategy would be followed to resolve the institution in the event of significant financial distress, including identifying how insured bank subsidiaries would be adequately protected from risk created by other affiliates. The failure to cure deficiencies in a resolution plan would enable the FRB and the FDIC, acting jointly, to impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, or restrictions on growth, activities or operations and, if such failure persists, require the divestiture of assets or operations. HSBC and HSBC Bank USA submitted their latest resolution plans in 2018. 

Simultaneous with the Tailoring Rules, the FRB and FDIC jointly finalized a rule to revise the regulations implementing the resolution planning requirements for depository institution holding companies (the "SIFI Plan") in the Dodd-Frank Act (the "SIFI Plan Rule"). Under the SIFI Plan Rule, HSBC is required to file a SIFI Plan every three years, alternating between a full resolution plan and a targeted resolution plan, which would generally be limited to core areas such as capital and liquidity, as well as identifying material changes in other areas of the plan since its last submission. HSBC's next submission is a targeted resolution plan, which is due by July 1, 2021. HSBC's next full resolution plan submission is not required until July 1, 2024. The SIFI Plan Rule did not revise the resolution plan requirements applicable to HSBC Bank USA, which are administered solely by the FDIC. In April 2019, the FDIC requested comment on an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that would alter the FDIC's separate resolution plan requirements for insured depository institutions (the "IDI Plan") with total consolidated assets of at least $50 billion ("Covered IDIs"), including HSBC Bank USA. The proposal delays the requirement for HSBC Bank USA (as well as other Covered IDIs) to file its next IDI Plan until a future date to be specified by the FDIC. Consequently, HSBC Bank USA did not file an IDI Plan in 2019.

Non-U.S. Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements HSBC North America and HSBC USA also continue to support HSBC's implementation of the Basel III framework, as adopted by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority. We supply data regarding credit risk, operational risk and market risk to support HSBC's regulatory capital and risk-weighted asset calculations and information relevant to HSBC's compliance with applicable liquidity requirements. 

General Our capital resources are summarized under "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in MD&#38;A. Capital amounts and ratios for HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA are summarized in Note 25, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements" of the consolidated financial statements. From time to time, bank regulators propose amendments to or issue interpretations of risk-based or leverage capital guidelines. Such proposals or interpretations could, upon implementation, affect reported capital ratios and net risk-weighted assets. 

Deposit Insurance Deposits placed at HSBC Bank USA and HTCD are insured by the FDIC, subject to the limitations and conditions of applicable law and the FDIC's regulations. The standard deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor for each account category. HSBC Bank USA and HTCD are subject to risk based assessments from the FDIC. Such assessments determine the deposit insurance costs paid by HSBC Bank USA and HTCD to the FDIC. While the assessments are generally payable quarterly, the FDIC also has the authority to impose special assessments to prevent the Deposit Insurance Fund from declining to an unacceptable level. 

Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering The USA Patriot Act (the "Patriot Act") of 2001, contains significant record keeping and customer identity requirements, expands the government's powers to freeze or confiscate assets and increases the available penalties that may be assessed against financial institutions for violation of the requirements of the Patriot Act intended to detect and deter money laundering. The U.S. Treasury Secretary developed and implemented final regulations with regard to the anti-money laundering ("AML") compliance obligations of financial institutions (a term which includes insured U.S. depository institutions, U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, U.S. broker-dealers and numerous other entities). The U.S. Treasury Secretary delegated certain authority to a bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department known as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ("FinCEN"). 

Many of the AML compliance requirements of the Patriot Act, as implemented by FinCEN, are generally consistent with the anti-money laundering compliance obligations that applied to HSBC Bank USA under the Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA") and applicable FRB regulations before the Patriot Act was adopted. These include requirements to adopt and implement an AML program, report suspicious transactions and implement due diligence procedures for certain correspondent and private banking accounts. Certain other specific requirements under the Patriot Act involve compliance obligations. The Patriot Act and other recent events have also resulted in heightened scrutiny of the BSA and AML compliance programs by bank regulators. 

Cybersecurity Regulatory Proposals &#32;&#32; In 2016, the FRB, FDIC, and OCC issued a joint advance notice of proposed rulemaking that would impose enhanced cyber risk management standards on banking organizations with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets and certain of their service providers. The standards address five categories: (i) cyber risk governance; (ii) cyber risk management; (iii) internal dependency management; (iv) external dependency management; and (v) incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. The agencies are also considering proposing more stringent "Sector Critical Standards" that would apply to systems "deemed critical to the financial sector." The advanced notice of proposed rulemaking leaves open the precise form the enhanced standards would take, and instead lays out possibilities ranging from policy guidance on best practices to specific regulations. We are monitoring future developments in this area and their potential impact on our operations. 

State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity to continue, and are continually monitoring developments in the states. 

Single-Counterparty Credit Limits &#32;&#32; In 2018, the FRB finalized a rule, consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, to limit credit exposures to single counterparties for large BHCs and IHCs, including HSBC North America. As a result of the rule, HSBC North America, together with its subsidiaries, will be prohibited from having net credit exposure to a single unaffiliated counterparty in excess of 25 percent of HSBC North America's Tier 1 capital beginning July 1, 2020. In addition, HSBC North America, together with its subsidiaries, could become subject to a separate limit on its exposures to certain unaffiliated systemically important counterparties if its parent, HSBC, cannot certify its compliance with a large exposure regime in the U.K. that is consistent with the Basel large exposure framework by July 1, 2020. In November 2019, the FRB proposed to extend the initial compliance dates for foreign banks such as HSBC, but not their IHCs. &#32; We continue to evaluate the potential effects of this rule and the recent proposal on our operations. 

Derivatives Regulation &#32; &#32;Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act imposes comprehensive regulation on the over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives markets, including credit default, equity, foreign exchange and interest rate swaps. Implementation of Title VII is the responsibility of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") (for swaps based on non-securities underliers or broad-based security indices), the SEC (for swaps based on individual securities and narrow-based security indices, known as "security- 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

based swaps") and, to a lesser extent, U.S. banking regulators (for certain rules applicable to banks). The CFTC has adopted final rules implementing the most significant provisions of Title VII applicable to swaps. In particular, certain swap dealers, including HSBC Bank USA, have provisionally registered with the CFTC and become members of the National Futures Association, subjecting them to an extensive array of corporate governance requirements, business conduct standards, reporting requirements, mandatory clearing and trading of certain swaps and other regulatory standards affecting their derivatives businesses. These requirements have and continue to significantly increase the costs associated with HSBC Bank USA's derivatives businesses. 

In addition to these CFTC rules, as a provisionally registered swap dealer that is a national bank, HSBC Bank USA is subject to the final rules establishing margin requirements for non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps adopted in November 2015 by the OCC jointly with other U.S. banking regulators. Subject to certain exceptions, the final margin rules require HSBC Bank USA to collect and post initial and variation margin for non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps entered into with other swap dealers and certain financial end users that exceed a minimum threshold of transactional activity, and for financial end users that do not meet the minimum transactional activity threshold, to collect and post variation margin (but not initial margin). 

The final margin rules also limit the types of assets that are eligible to satisfy initial and variation margin requirements, require initial margin to be segregated at a third-party custodian and impose requirements on internal models used to calculate initial margin requirements. The final margin rules follow a phased implementation schedule, with additional counterparties becoming subject to initial margin requirements in September 2020 depending on the transactional volume of the parties and their affiliates. These final rules, as well as parallel margin rules from the CFTC, the SEC, and certain non-U.S. regulators will increase the costs and liquidity burden associated with trading non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps and may adversely affect our business in such products. In particular, the imposition of initial margin requirements on inter-affiliate transactions will significantly increase the cost of certain consolidated risk management activities and may adversely affect HSBC to a greater extent than some of our competitors. 

Also, HSBC Bank USA engages in equity and credit derivatives businesses that are subject to the SEC's jurisdiction to regulate security-based swaps under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. The SEC has finalized the key rules governing the application of Title VII requirements to security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants. The registration requirements and other rules applicable to security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants are expected to come into effect in October 2021. Certain HSBC affiliates, including HSBC Bank USA, may be required to register and become subject to these rules when the registration requirement becomes effective. Because HSBC Bank USA's equity and credit derivatives businesses are also subject to the CFTC's jurisdiction under Title VII, material differences between the final SEC rules and existing CFTC rules could materially increase our costs of compliance with Title VII by requiring the implementation of significant additional policies, procedures, documentation, systems and controls for those businesses. 

The " Volcker Rule " &#32;&#32;The Volcker Rule prohibits insured depository institutions and companies affiliated with insured depository institutions (collectively, banking entities) from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options for their own account. The Volcker Rule also imposes limits on banking entities' investments in, and other relationships with, hedge funds and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule provides exemptions for certain activities, including market-making, underwriting, hedging, trading in government obligations and organizing and offering hedge funds and private equity funds, subject to certain conditions. A banking entity with significant U.S. trading operations, such as HSBC North America, is required to maintain a detailed compliance program to comply with the restrictions of the Volcker Rule. 

In September and October 2019, the federal agencies responsible for administration of the Volcker Rule (the SEC, FDIC, FRB, OCC and CFTC) finalized amendments to simplify and tailor compliance requirements related to the proprietary trading provisions of the Volcker Rule. Given that HSBC North America has more than $20 billion in trading assets and liabilities, it remains subject to the highest expectations under the Volcker Rule. While the recent amendments are intended to streamline the existing requirements and result in a more simplified revised final rule, these changes to the Volcker Rule may result in increased compliance and operational costs. These amendments to the Volcker Rule became effective January 1, 2020, with compliance required by January 1, 2021. We continue to assess the impact of the amendments on our operations. On January 30, 2020, the agencies proposed further amendments to the Volcker Rule's funds provisions, which would, if adopted, clarify key definitions and add new, and modify certain existing, exclusions from the definition of covered fund. The proposal is currently open for comment, and the timeline for finalization remains uncertain. 

Competition The GLB Act eliminated many of the regulatory restrictions on providing financial services in the United States. The GLB Act allows for financial institutions and other providers of financial products to enter into combinations that permit a single organization to offer a complete line of financial products and services. In addition, the Volcker Rule places restrictions on bank-affiliated financial companies' trading activities and private equity and hedge fund investments, which may provide a competitive advantage to financial companies that do not have U.S. banking operations and may impact liquidity in the products and activities in which we engage. We face intense competition in all of the markets we serve, competing with banks and other financial institutions such as insurance companies, commercial finance providers, brokerage firms and investment companies. The financial services industry has experienced consolidation in recent years as financial institutions involved in a broad range of products and services have merged, been acquired or dispersed. This trend is expected to continue and has resulted in, among other 

##TABLE_START HSBC USA Inc. 

##TABLE_END

things, greater concentrations of deposits and other resources. Competition is expected to continue to be intense given the multiple banks and other financial services companies which offer products and services in our markets, noting that we compete with different banks and financial services companies in different markets, given our strategy.
