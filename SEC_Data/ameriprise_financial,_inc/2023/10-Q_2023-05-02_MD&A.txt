 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; that follow and our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes presented in Item 1. Our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) on February 23, 2023 (&#8220;2022 10-K&#8221;), as well as our current reports on Form 8-K and other publicly available information. References below to &#8220;Ameriprise Financial,&#8221; &#8220;Ameriprise,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries. 

Overview 

Ameriprise Financial is a diversified financial services company with a more than 125-year history of providing financial solutions. We are a long-standing leader in financial planning and advice with $1.2 trillion in assets under management and administration as of March 31, 2023. We offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve individual and institutional clients&#8217; financial objectives. 

The products and services we provide retail clients and, to a lesser extent, institutional clients, are the primary source of our revenues and net income. Revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies. These factors, in turn, are largely determined by overall investment market performance and the depth and breadth of our individual client relationships. 

We operate our business in the broader context of the macroeconomic forces around us, including the global and U.S. economies, the coronavirus disease 2019 (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) pandemic, changes in interest and inflation rates, financial market volatility, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, geopolitical strain, the competitive environment, client and customer activities and preferences, and the various regulatory and legislative developments. Financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. In addition, the business, political and regulatory environments in which we operate are subject to elevated uncertainty and substantial, frequent change. Accordingly, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives and obtaining operational and strategic leverage from our core capabilities. The success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed in Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in our 2022 10-K and other factors as discussed herein. 

Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the values of market risk benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits and the &#8220;spread&#8221; income generated on our deposit products, fixed insurance, the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts and fixed deferred annuities. We have been operating in a historically low interest rate environment but have recently experienced a substantial increase in rates with uncertainty about where rates will go in the future. A higher (lower) interest rate environment may result in decreases (increases) to our long-duration contract reserves, which may impact our adjusted operating earnings after tax. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.&#8221; 

On June 2, 2021, we filed an application to convert Ameriprise Bank, FSB to a state-chartered industrial bank regulated by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We also filed an application to transition the FSB&#8217;s personal trust services business to a new limited purpose national trust bank regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. If the applications are approved, the proposed changes are not expected to impact our long-term strategy for the bank and should enable us to continue our strong lineup of banking solutions, including deposits, credit cards, mortgages and securities-based lending to our wealth management clients without interruption. 

We consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (&#8220;CIEs&#8221;). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate &#38; Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in net investment income. We include the fees from these entities in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment. 

While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), management believes that adjusted operating earnings measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of reinsurance accrual; the market impact on non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and universal life (&#8220;UL&#8221;) insurance contracts), net of hedges and the reinsurance accrual; mean reversion related impacts (the impact on variable universal life (&#8220;VUL&#8221;) products for the difference between assumed and updated separate account investment 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

performance on the reinsurance accrual and additional insurance benefit reserves); the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate and currency changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; block transfer reinsurance transaction impact; gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. 

The market impact on non-traditional long-duration products includes changes in market risk benefits and embedded derivative values caused by changes in financial market conditions, net of changes in economic hedge values and unhedged items including the difference between assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and certain policyholder contract elections. The market impact also includes certain valuation adjustments made in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure s, including the impact on embedded derivative values of discounting projected benefits to reflect a current estimate of our life insurance subsidiary&#8217;s nonperformance spread. 

In the first quarter of 2023, management introduced an adjusted capital measure (&#8220;Available Capital for Capital Adequacy&#8221;), which management believes best reflects the available capital resources of our core operations and facilitates a meaningful trend analysis. Available Capital for Capital Adequacy adjusts GAAP total equity and excludes accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;); goodwill and intangibles; RiverSource Life Insurance Company&#8217;s GAAP equity excluding AOCI; and includes RiverSource Life Insurance Company&#8217;s statutory total adjusted capital prepared in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the State of Minnesota Department of Commerce; and other adjustments primarily certain deferred tax balances. 

Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance and available capital on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as adjusted operating measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. 

Concurrent with the adoption of ASU 2018-12, Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts , management no longer excludes adjustments for deferred acquisition costs (&#8220;DAC&#8221;), deferred sales inducement costs (&#8220;DSIC&#8221;) and unearned revenue amortization from adjusted operating earnings measures. Amortization of DAC, DSIC, and unearned revenue is no longer impacted by markets and is now amortized on a constant-level basis in accordance with GAAP. 

It is management&#8217;s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets. 

Our financial targets are: 

&#8226; Adjusted operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and 

&#8226; Adjusted operating return on equity of over 30%.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting and reporting policies and estimates we have identified as fundamental to a full understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition are described below. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our accounting policies. 

Valuation of Investments 

The most significant component of our investments is our Available-for-Sale securities, which we carry at fair value within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the fair value of our Available-for-Sale securities. Financial markets are subject to significant movements in valuation and liquidity, which can impact our ability to liquidate and the selling price that can be realized for our securities and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain investments. We are unable to predict impacts and determine sensitivities in reported amounts reflecting such market movements on our aggregate Available-for-Sale portfolio. Changes to these assumptions do not occur in isolation and it is 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

impracticable to predict such impacts at the individual security unit of measure which are predominately Level 2 fair value and based on observable inputs. 

Market Risk Benefits 

Market risk benefits are contracts or contract features that both provide protection to the contractholder from other-than-nominal capital market risk and expose us to other-than-nominal capital market risk. Market risk benefits include certain contract features on variable annuity products that provide minimum guarantees to policyholders. Guarantees accounted for as market risk benefits include guaranteed minimum death benefits (&#8220;GMDB&#8221;), guaranteed minimum income benefits (&#8220;GMIB&#8221;), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (&#8220;GMWB&#8221;) and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (&#8220;GMAB&#8221;). 

Variable Annuities 

We have approximately $77 billion of variable annuity account value that has been issued over a period of more than fifty years. The diversified variable annuity block consists of $33 billion of account value with no living benefit guarantees and $44 billion of account value with living benefit guarantees, primarily GMWB provisions. The business is predominately issued through the Ameriprise Financial &#174; advisor network. The majority of the variable annuity contracts offered by us contain GMDB provisions. We discontinued most new sales of GMWB and GMAB at the end of 2021 and new sales were completely discontinued as of mid-2022. We also previously offered contracts containing GMIB provisions. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our variable annuity contracts. 

In determining the liabilities for market risk benefits, we project these benefits and contract assessments using actuarial models to simulate various equity market scenarios. Significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to customer asset value growth rates, mortality, persistency, benefit utilization and investment margins. Management reviews, and where appropriate, adjusts its assumptions each quarter. Unless management identifies a material deviation over the course of quarterly monitoring, management reviews and updates these assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year. 

In addition, the valuation of market risk benefits is impacted by an estimate of our nonperformance risk adjustment. This estimate includes a spread over the U.S. Treasury curve as of the balance sheet date. As our estimate of this spread over the U.S. Treasury curve widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. The change in fair value due to changes in our nonperformance risk is recorded in other comprehensive income. 

Regarding the exposure to variable annuity living benefit guarantees, the source of behavioral risk is driven by changes in policyholder surrenders and utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits. We have extensive experience studies and analysis to monitor changes and trends in policyholder behavior. A significant volume of company-specific policyholder experience data is available and provides management with the ability to regularly analyze policyholder behavior. On a monthly basis, actual surrender and benefit utilization experience is compared to expectations. Experience data includes detailed policy information providing the opportunity to review impacts of multiple variables. The ability to analyze differences in experience, such as presence of a living benefit rider, existence of surrender charges, and tax qualifications provide us an effective approach in quickly detecting changes in policyholder behavior. 

At least annually, we perform a thorough policyholder behavior analysis to validate the assumptions included in our market risk benefit reserves. The variable annuity assumptions and resulting reserve computations reflect multiple policyholder variables. Differentiation in assumptions by policyholder age, existence of surrender charges, guaranteed withdrawal utilization, and tax qualification are examples of factors recognized in establishing management&#8217;s assumptions used in reserve calculations. The extensive data derived from our variable annuity block informs management in confirming previous assumptions and revising the variable annuity behavior assumptions. Changes in assumptions are governed by a review and approval process to ensure an appropriate measurement of all impacted financial statement balances. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement, sensitivities in reported amounts, offsetting impacts, or future impacts to the Consolidated Financial Statements over time or in any given future period. 

Future Policy Benefits and Claims 

We establish reserves to cover the benefits associated with non-traditional and traditional long-duration products. Non-traditional long-duration products include variable and structured variable annuity contracts, fixed annuity contracts and UL and VUL policies. Traditional long-duration products include term life insurance, whole life insurance, disability income (&#8220;DI&#8221;) and long term care (&#8220;LTC&#8221;) insurance and life contingent payout annuity products. 

The establishment of reserves is an estimation process using a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements. If actual experience is better than or equal to the results of the estimation process, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If actual experience is worse than the results of the estimation process, additional reserves may be required. 

Non-Traditional Long-Duration Products, including Embedded Derivatives 

UL and VUL 

A portion of our UL and VUL policies have product features that result in profits followed by losses from the insurance component of the contract. These profits followed by losses can be generated by the cost structure of the product or secondary guarantees in the contract. The secondary guarantee ensures that, subject to specified conditions, the policy will not terminate and will continue to 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

provide a death benefit even if there is insufficient policy value to cover the monthly deductions and charges. The liability for these future losses is determined at the reporting date using actuarial models to estimate the death benefits in excess of account value and recognizing the excess over the estimated life based on expected assessments (e.g. cost of insurance charges, contractual administrative charges, similar fees and investment margin). Significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to client asset value growth rates, mortality, persistency and investment margins. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement, sensitivities in reported amounts, offsetting impacts, or future impacts to the Consolidated Financial Statements over time or in any given future period. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the liability for contracts with secondary guarantees. 

Embedded Derivatives 

The fair value of embedded derivatives related to structured variable annuities, indexed annuities and IUL fluctuates based on equity markets and interest rates and is a liability. In addition, the valuation of embedded derivatives is impacted by an estimate of our nonperformance risk adjustment. This estimate includes a spread over the U.S. Treasury curve as of the balance sheet date. As our estimate of this spread over the U.S. Treasury curve widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. 

See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the fair value measurement of embedded derivatives. 

Traditional Long-Duration Products 

The liabilities for traditional long-duration products include cash flows related to unpaid amounts on reported claims, estimates of benefits payable on claims incurred but not yet reported and estimates of benefits that will become payable on term life, whole life, DI, LTC, and life contingent payout annuity policies as claims are incurred in the future. Accordingly, the claim liability (also referred to as disabled life reserves) is presented together as one liability for future policy benefits. 

A liability for future policy benefits, which is the present value of estimated future policy benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and certain related expenses less the present value of estimated future net premiums to be collected from policyholders, is accrued as premium revenue is recognized. Expected insurance benefits are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to premium revenue recognized (referred to as the net premium approach). The net premium ratio reflects cash flows from contract inception to contract termination (i.e., through the claim paying period) and cannot exceed 100%. 

The liability for future policy benefits will be updated for actual experience at least on an annual basis and concurrent with changes to cash flow assumptions. When net premiums are updated for cash flow changes, the estimated cash flows over the entire life of a group of contracts are updated using historical experience and updated future cash flow assumptions. 

The cash flows used in the calculation are discounted using the forward rate curve on the original contract issue date. The discount rate represents an upper-medium-grade (i.e., low credit risk) fixed-income instrument yield (i.e., an A rating) that reflects the duration characteristics of the liability. 

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 

We use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to various market risks. All derivatives are recorded at fair value. The fair value of our derivative instruments is determined using either market quotes or valuation models that are based upon the net present value of estimated future cash flows and incorporate current market observable inputs to the extent available. We are unable to predict impacts and determine sensitivities in reported amounts reflecting such market movements on our aggregate derivative portfolio. Changes to assumptions do not occur in isolation and it is impracticable to predict such impacts at the individual security unit of measure which are predominately Level 2 fair value and based on observable inputs. 

For further details on the types of derivatives we use and how we account for them, see Note 2, Note 13 and Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For discussion of our market risk exposures and hedging program and related sensitivity testing, see Item 3. &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.&#8221;

Assets Under Management and Administration 

Assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia Threadneedle Investments funds, institutional clients and clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisors selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and CIEs. 

Assets under administration (&#8220;AUA&#8221;) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies&#8217; products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients&#8217; brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. 

AUM and AUA do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide advisory services such as model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.

Overall 

Pretax income decreased $510 million, or 51%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; The market impact on non-traditional long duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and UL insurance contracts), net of hedges and the reinsurance accrual was an expense of $475 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to a benefit of $180 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A negative impact from lower average equity markets compared to the prior year period. Our average WEI, which is a proxy for equity movements on AUM, decreased 10% in the quarter compared to the prior year period. The average S&#38;P 500 index was 10% lower in the quarter compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; An $18 million unfavorable impact of lower asset management net performance fees. 

&#8226; A favorable impact from the continued increase in short-term interest rates compared to the prior year along with higher balances in bank and certificate products. 

Net Revenues 

Management and financial advice fees decreased $322 million, or 13%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period reflecting market depreciation, the cumulative impact of Asset Management net outflows and a decrease in performance fees of $49 million, partially offset by continued wrap account net inflows. 

Distribution fees increased $71 million, or 16%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period due to $110 million of higher fees on off-balance sheet brokerage cash due to an increase in short-term interest rates, partially offset by lower transactional activity and market depreciation. 

Net investment income increased $437 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting: 

&#8226; The favorable impact of growth in Ameriprise Bank customer deposits and certificate business as a result of the market environment and our strategic decision to invest in these businesses. 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

&#8226; The favorable impact of the recent trend in rising interest rates on the investment portfolio yield, including from investment portfolio repositioning in our insurance business in the fourth quarter of 2022. 

&#8226; The unfavorable impact of net realized investment gains of $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to net realized investment gains of $20 million for the prior year period. 

Premiums, policy and contract charges increased $24 million, or 7%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher sales of immediate annuities with a life contingent feature. 

Banking and deposit interest expense increased $101 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting higher average crediting rates and higher average volumes on certificates and Ameriprise Bank cash deposits. 

Expenses 

Distribution expenses decreased $74 million, or 6%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting lower advisor compensation due to a decrease in average wrap account balances from market depreciation. 

Interest credited to fixed accounts increased $23 million, or 16%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following item: 

&#8226; A $34 million increase in expense from other market impacts on IUL benefits, net of hedges, which was an expense of $46 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to an expense of $12 million for the prior year period. The increase in expense was primarily due to an increase in the IUL embedded derivative in the current period, which reflected less discounting due to lower treasury rates. 

Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $269 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; A $223 million increase in expense from market impacts on structured variable annuities (&#8220;SVA&#8221;) embedded derivative, net of hedges in place to offset those risks. This increase was the result of a favorable $160 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the SVA embedded derivative and an unfavorable $383 million change in the market impact on SVA embedded derivative. The main market driver contributing to these changes was the equity market impact on the SVA embedded derivative net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to a benefit in the prior year period. 

&#8226; The impact of higher sales of immediate annuities with a life contingent feature. 

&#8226; The impact of increased volume in structured variable annuities. 

Change in fair value of market risk benefits increased $389 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following item: 

&#8226; A $405 million increase in expense from market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks. This increase was the result of a favorable $519 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and an unfavorable $924 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits reserves. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below: 

&#8226; Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to an expense in the prior year period. 

&#8226; Interest rate and bond impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to a benefit in the prior year period. 

&#8226; Volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a lower net expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period. 

Interest and debt expense increased $32 million, or 80%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting higher interest expense of CIEs and the issuance of $750 million of unsecured senior notes in March 2023. 

Income Taxes 

Our effective tax rate was 15.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 18.0% for the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 was primarily the result of lower pretax income, an increase in foreign tax credits net of addback, and an increase in incentive compensation, offset by an increase in state income taxes net of federal benefit compared to the prior year period. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on income taxes.

General and administrative expense, which excludes integration and restructuring charges, increased $5 million, or 8%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the unfavorable mark-to-market impact on share-based compensation expense. 

Fair Value Measurements 

We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, market risk benefits, embedded derivatives, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements. 

Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance Risk 

Companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders, fixed deferred indexed annuities, structured variable annuities, and IUL insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders, fixed deferred indexed annuities, structured annuities, and IUL insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for risk, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the U.S. Treasury curve as of March 31, 2023. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the U.S. Treasury curve, the reduction to total equity would be approximately $1.2 billion, net of the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 21%), based on March 31, 2023 credit spreads. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview 

As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had Available Capital for Capital Adequacy of $5.4 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively. Available Capital for Capital Adequacy best reflects the available capital resources of our core operations. 

We maintained substantial liquidity during the three months ended March 31, 2023. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $8.4 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding CIEs and other restricted cash on a consolidated basis. 

As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the parent company had $770 million and $389 million, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents, and unencumbered liquid securities. Liquid securities predominantly include U.S. government agency mortgage back securities. Additional sources of liquidity at the parent company include a line of credit with an affiliate up to $727 million and an unsecured revolving committed credit facility for up to $1.0 billion that expires in June 2026. Management&#8217;s estimate of liquidity available to the parent company in a volatile and uncertain economic environment as of March 31, 2023 was $2.0 billion which includes cash, cash equivalents, unencumbered liquid securities, the line of credit with an affiliate and a portion of the committed credit facility. 

Under the terms of the committed credit facility, we can increase the availability to $1.25 billion upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At March 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of letters of credit issued against the facility. Our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We remain in compliance with all such covenants at March 31, 2023. 

In addition, we have access to collateralized borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) advances, and advances at the Federal Reserve. Our subsidiaries, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (&#8220;RiverSource Life&#8221;), and Ameriprise Bank, FSB are members of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $8.2 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, under the FHLB facilities, of which $201 million was outstanding as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities. In addition, Ameriprise Bank, FSB maintains access to a significant level of collateralized borrowings from the Federal Reserve and the Company has no advances outstanding. 

There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2022 10-K. 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

We issued $750 million of 5.150% unsecured senior notes on March 9, 2023. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our long-term debt maturities, including $750 million maturing within the 2023 calendar year. 

We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances, our availability of internal and external borrowings and dividends from our subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term operating liquidity needs and stress requirements. 

On August 16, 2022, federal legislation commonly referred to as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (&#8220;IRA&#8221;) was enacted. We have evaluated the tax provisions of the IRA, the most significant of which are the corporate alternative minimum tax (&#8220;CAMT&#8221;) and the share repurchase excise tax. Both the CAMT and share repurchase tax are effective beginning in 2023. We expect to be an applicable corporation required to compute CAMT; however, based on current estimates, we do not believe we will be liable for the CAMT in 2023 and therefore have not recorded a liability. We will be a covered corporation subject to the share repurchase excise tax. As the Internal Revenue Service issues additional guidance related to the IRA, we will continue to evaluate any impact to our consolidated financial statements. 

Dividends from Subsidiaries 

Ameriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (&#8220;ACC&#8221;), AMPF Holding, LLC, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC (&#8220;AFS&#8221;) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (&#8220;AEIS&#8221;), our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp., our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC, TAM UK International Holdings Ltd, which includes Ameriprise International Holdings GmbH within its organizational structure, and Columbia Threadneedle Investments UK International Ltd. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements. 

Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows:

In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a strategy for 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $605 million (including $200 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $138 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $777 million (including $300 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $129 million (including $95 million to Ameriprise Bank, FSB). 

In 2009, RiverSource Life established an agreement to protect its exposure to Genworth Life Insurance Company (&#8220;GLIC&#8221;) for its reinsured LTC. In 2016, substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized. The terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies. GLIC is domiciled in Delaware, so in the event GLIC was subjected to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings, such proceedings would be located in (and governed by) Delaware laws. Delaware courts have a long tradition of respecting commercial and reinsurance affairs as well as contracts among sophisticated parties. Similar credit protections to what we have with GLIC have been tested and respected in Delaware and elsewhere in the United States, and as a result we believe our credit protections would be respected even in the unlikely event that GLIC becomes subject to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings in Delaware. Accordingly, while no credit protections are perfect, we believe the correct way to think about the risks represented by our counterparty credit exposure to GLIC is not the full amount of the gross liability that GLIC reinsures, but a much smaller net exposure to GLIC (if any that might exist after taking into account our credit protections). Thus, management believes that our agreement and offsetting non-LTC legacy arrangements with Genworth will enable RiverSource Life to recover on all net exposure in all material respects in the event of a rehabilitation or insolvency of GLIC. 

Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases 

We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $138 million and $133 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. On April 24, 2023, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.35 per common share. The dividend will be paid on May 19, 2023 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on May 8, 2023. 

In January 2022, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $3.0 billion for the repurchase of our common stock through March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2023, we had $1.1 billion remaining under the share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we repurchased a total of 1.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $322.54 per share.
