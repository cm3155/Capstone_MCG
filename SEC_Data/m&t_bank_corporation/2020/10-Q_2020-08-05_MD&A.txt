 Item 2. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Overview

M&#38;T Bank Corporation (&#8220;M&#38;T&#8221;) recorded net income in the second quarter of 2020 of $241 million or $1.74 of diluted earnings per common share, compared with $473 million or $3.34 of diluted earnings per common share in the year-earlier quarter. Net income and diluted earnings per common share during the first quarter of 2020 were $269 million and $1.93, respectively. Basic earnings per common share were $1.74 in the recent quarter, compared with $3.34 in the year earlier quarter and $1.93 in the initial quarter of 2020. Net income totaled $510 million or $3.67 of diluted and basic earnings per common share in the first half of 2020, compared with $956 million or $6.69 of diluted and basic earnings per common share in the corresponding period of 2019.

The annualized rate of return on average total assets for M&#38;T and its consolidated subsidiaries (&#8220;the Company&#8221;) in the second quarter of 2020 was .71%, compared with 1.60% in the year-earlier quarter and .90% in the first quarter of 2020. The annualized rate of return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity was 6.13% in the recent quarter, compared with 12.68% in the second quarter of 2019 and 7.00% in 2020&#8217;s initial quarter. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, the annualized rates of return on average assets and average common shareholders&#8217; equity were .80% and 6.56%, respectively, compared with 1.64% and 12.91%, respectively, in the similar period of 2019. 

Effective January 1, 2020, M&#38;T adopted amended accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. That guidance requires an allowance for credit losses to be deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net carrying value that is expected to be collected over the contractual term of the assets considering relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. The new accounting guidance replaces the previous incurred loss model for determining the allowance for credit losses. The adoption of the amended guidance resulted in a $132 million increase in the allowance for credit losses as of January 1, 2020. Additional information on the new accounting guidance is provided under the heading &#8220;Provision for Credit Losses&#8221; and in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

Financial results for the second quarter of 2020 were adversely impacted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) pandemic. The economic outlook at June 30 deteriorated as compared with what had been assumed by the Company as of the end of the first quarter of 2020, with considerable uncertainty existing about the length and extent of the pandemic&#8217;s impact on the nation&#8217;s economy. Due to higher expected credit losses that reflect the worsening outlook, the provision for credit losses in the recent quarter rose to $325 million from $250 million in the initial 2020 quarter and $55 million in the second quarter of 2019. The 2020 periods reflect the adoption of the new accounting guidance for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial instruments. Spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, the low interest rate environment has resulted in decreased taxable-equivalent net interest income in the recent quarter, while waivers and reduced customer transaction activity led to lower fees earned on deposit accounts.

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (&#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) was signed into law. Among other things, the CARES Act provides relief to borrowers, including the opportunity to defer loan payments while not negatively affecting their credit standing, and also provides funding opportunities for small businesses under the Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) from approved Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) lenders, including M&#38;T Bank. For commercial and consumer customers, the Company has provided a host of relief options, including loan maturity extensions, payment deferrals, fee waivers and low interest rate loan products. During the second quarter of 2020, M&#38;T Bank funded PPP loans that totaled $6.5 billion at June 30, 2020. 

Updated economic forecasts at June 30, 2020 and at March 31, 2020 resulted in higher estimates of expected credit losses in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio than at January 1, 2020, resulting in significant increases in the provision for credit losses in the first two quarters of 2020. The Company expects that it will continue to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic after June 30, 2020 and believes that the pandemic could have a material impact on its future financial results. Specifically, the Company expects the following balance sheet and income statement categories to be affected:

- 52 -

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; 

M&#38;T Bank is an approved lender in the Main Street Lending Program, a provision of the CARES Act. Customer demand for this borrowing opportunity is not fully known, so that potential impact is not determinable&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Net interest income and net interest margin &#8211;the low interest rate environment will continue to negatively affect the Company&#8217;s net interest margin&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Provision for credit losses &#8211; deteriorating economic assumptions used to calculate the allowance for credit losses at the end of future reporting periods could result in higher levels of the provision and allowance for credit losses than have been historically experienced. In addition, the impact on borrowers&#8217; ability to repay loans could be negatively affected, potentially leading to increased charge-offs&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Noninterest income will likely be lower as it relates to the trust businesses, as it is likely that fee waivers will increase for proprietary money market mutual fund management fees, and some of trust income is derived from equity market performance, which could be volatile. The potential for a prolonged slowdown in debt capital market activities also exists. Consumer deposit service charge fees may continue to be lower than historical levels due to fee waivers and lower debit card transactions. Credit card interchange volumes are also expected to be lower than historical norms, resulting in lower fees. Residential mortgage applications are expected to continue to be strong given the low interest rate environment&#59; and 

&#160;

&#8226; 

The resurgence of the epidemic in many parts of the country has resulted in certain government mandates that will impact aspects of the Company&#8217;s expense base, such as the use of contractors, travel and entertainment costs, and other types of discretionary expenditures. In addition, the Company has curtailed hiring and has redeployed employees to address the changing dynamics of the business given the current environment. 

The national effort to mitigate the pandemic has resulted in a challenging environment for businesses and their employees. The Company has taken actions to provide a safe environment for its customers and employees and to provide relief to customers in a variety of ways. Examples of those actions include:

&#160;

&#8226; 

The deployment of a Pandemic Response Plan to manage the pandemic&#8217;s effects on operations, employees and customers, including seeking to ensure employee safety, maintain continuity of operations and service levels for customers, preserve the Company&#8217;s financial strength, and comply with applicable laws and regulations. Actions have included placing restrictions on travel, implementing a modified branch service model, implementing social distancing requirements, and mandating for all employees whose jobs can be performed remotely to work from home. The Company has formed a task force to develop a plan for employees to return to the office when deemed appropriate while ensuring a safe work environment&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Nearly all M&#38;T Bank branches remain open, with open lobbies or with in-person visits by appointment and normal access to drive-through windows and ATMs&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Nearly 90% of the Company&#8217;s non-branch employees continue to work remotely&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Loan customers are receiving COVID-19 related relief in various forms, including modification and forbearance requests as of June 30, 2020 as follows: 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Commercial &#8211; 9,300 customers with balances of $14.0 billion, including $4.2 billion associated with automobile and recreation finance dealers&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Residential real estate &#8211; 85,000 customers with balances of $15.4 billion (including approximately 77,000 customers with balances of $13.2 billion that are serviced for others and, therefore not included in the Company&#8217;s assets ) &#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Consumer &#8211; including automobile, recreational finance, home equity lines and loans, credit cards and personal loans &#8211; 22,200 customers with balances of $685 million. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Paycheck Protection Program &#8211; At June 30, 2020, 34,600 customers have outstanding loans totaling $6.5 billion&#59; and

In July 2019, M&#38;T agreed to sell its non-controlling interest in an asset manager obtained in the 2011 acquisi tion of Wilmington Trust Corporation that had been accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, as a result, as of June 30, 2019 recorded a $48 million charge (reflected in &#8220;other costs of operations&#8221;) to reduce the carrying value of the invest ment to its net realizable value. Similar to other active investment managers, the investee entity had experienced a decrease in assets under management and during the second quarter of 2019 the entity&#8217;s chief executive and investment officer announced hi s retirement. Following that announcement, successor management submitted a proposal to M&#38;T to restructure the organization of the entity. The after-tax impact of the charge was a reduction in net income of $36 million, or $.27 of diluted earnings per comm on share in the second quarter of 2019. The sale of M&#38;T&#8217;s interest in the asset manager was effective September 30, 2019. 

During the first quarter of 2019, the Company increased its reserve for legal matters by $50 million in conjunction with matters associated with a subsidiary&#8217;s role as trustee of Employee Stock Ownership Plans in its Institutional Client Services business. That increase, on an after-tax basis, reduced net income in that quarter by $37 million, or $.27 of diluted earnings per common share. Also during that quarter, M&#38;T realized $37 million of distributed income from Bayview Lending Group LLC (&#8220;BLG&#8221;), increasing net income by $28 million, or $.20 of diluted earnings per common share. A similar distribution of $23 million was received in the first quarter of 2020, increasing net income by $17 million, or $.13 of diluted earnings per common share.

Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations

M&#38;T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a &#8220;net operating&#8221; or &#8220;tangible&#8221; basis, from which M&#38;T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations (when incurred) into the Company, since such items are considered by management to be &#8220;nonoperating&#8221; in nature. Although &#8220;net operating income&#8221; as defined by M&#38;T is not a GAAP measure, M&#38;T&#8217;s management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results.

Net operating income totaled $244 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $477 million in the year-earlier quarter and $272 million in the initial 2020 quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share the recent quarter were $1.76, compared with $3.37 in the second quarter of 2019 and $1.95 in the first quarter of 2020. For the first six months of 2020, net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per common share were $516 million and $3.71, respectively, compared with $963 million and $6.74, respectively, in the first half of 2019. 

Net operating income in the recent quarter expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets was .74%, compared with 1.68% in the similar quarter of 2019 and .94% in the initial 2020 quarter. Net operating income represented an annualized return on average tangible common equity of 9.04% in the second quarter of 2020, compared with 18.83% and 10.39% for the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2020, respectively. For the first half of 2020, net operating income represented an annualized return on average tanglibe assets and average tanglible common shareholders&#8217; equity of .84% and 9.71%, respectively, compared with 1.72% and 19.19%, respectively, in the corresponding 2019 period. 

Reconciliations of GAAP amounts with corresponding non-GAAP amounts are provided in table 2.

Taxable-equivalent Net Interest Income

Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $961 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $1.05 billion in the year-earlier quarter. That decline resulted predominantly from a 78 basis point (hundredths of one percent) narrowing of the net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets, to 3.13% in the recent quarter from 3.91% in the second quarter of 2019. The narrowing of the net interest margin was largely the result of declines in rates on loans and deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, reflecting the lower interest rate environment due to actions initiated by the Federal Reserve to decrease its target Federal funds rate three times in the second half of 2019 (each by a .25% increment) and twice in March of 2020 (first by .50%, than another by 1.0%). The impact of the recent quarter&#8217;s lower net interest margin on net interest income was partially offset by an increase in average earning assets of $16.0 billion from the year-earlier quarter. 

- 54 -

&#160;

Taxable-equivalent net interest income in the recent quarter declined $20 million, or 2%, from the first quarter of 2020 primarily driven by a 52 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin from 3.65% in the prior quarter, partially offset by a $15.3 billion rise in average earning assets. The increase in average earning assets in the recent quarter as compared with the second quarte r of 2019 and the initial quarter of 2020 resulted from higher average balances of loans and leases and interest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, partially offset by lower average investment securities balances. 

For the first six months of 2020, taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1.94 billion, down 8% from $2.10 billion in the corresponding 2019 period. That decrease was primarily attributable to a 60 basis point narrowing of the margin to 3.37% in the 2020 period from 3.97% in the year-earlier period, partially offset by a $9.1 billion increase in average earning assets. 

Average loans and leases totaled $97.8 billion in the second quarter of 2020, up $8.6 billion or 10% from $89.2 billion in the similar quarter of 2019. Commercial loans and leases averaged $29.7 billion in the second quarter of 2020, $6.4 billion or 27% higher than in the year-earlier quarter. That increase was predominantly the result of average outstanding PPP loans of $4.8 billion that were funded in the recent quarter. Average commercial real estate loans were $36.9 billion in the recent quarter, up $2.2 billion, or 6%, from $34.8 billion in the similar 2019 quarter. Included in average commercial real estate loans in the second quarters of 2020 and 2019 were loans held for sale of $287 million and $245 million, respectively. Reflecting ongoing repayments of loans obtained in a 2015 acquisition, average residential real estate loans declined $1.1 billion or 7% to $15.6 billion in the second quarter of 2020 from $16.7 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Included in average residential real estate loans were loans held for sale of $406 million in the recent quarter and $227 million in the second quarter of 2019. Consumer loans averaged $15.5 billion in the second quarter of 2020, up $1.2 billion, or 8%, from $14.3 billion in the year-earlier quarter, due to growth in average recreational finance loans (consisting predominantly of loans secured by recreational vehicles and boats) and, to a lesser extent, automobile loans that was partially offset by declines in outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit.

Average loan and lease balances in the second quarter of 2020 increased $6.1 billion, or 7%, from $91.7 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Commercial loan and lease average balances in the recent quarter were up $5.4 billion, or 22%, from $24.3 billion in the first quarter of 2020. That rise resulted predominantly from average loan balances associated with the PPP loans originated during 2020&#8217;s second quarter. Average commercial real estate loans in the second quarter of 2020 increased $914 million, or 3%, from $36.0 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Commercial real estate loans held for sale averaged $185 million in the first quarter of 2020. Average balances of residential real estate loans in the recently completed quarter declined $332 million, or 2%, from $15.9 billion in 2020&#8217;s first quarter, reflecting the continued pay down of loans obtained in the 2015 acquisition. Residential real estate loans held for sale averaged $409 million in the first quarter of 2020. Average consumer loans in the recent quarter increased $67 million from $15.5 billion in 2020&#8217;s first quarter. The accompanying table summarizes quarterly changes in the major components of the loan and lease portfolio.

For the first six months of 2020, average loans and leases totaled $94.8 billion, up 7%, from $88.8 billion in the corresponding 2019 period. Contributing to the rise were a $3.8 billion increase in average commercial loan and lease balances (due largely to PPP loans), a $1.8 billion increase in average commercial real eastate loans and a $1.3 billion increase in average consumer loan balances, partially offset by a $1.1 billion decline in average residential real estate loan balances.

The investment securities portfolio averaged $8.5 billion in the second quarter of 2020, down $3.7 billion, or 30%, from $12.2 billion in the year-earlier quarter and $602 million lower than the $9.1 billion averaged in the first quarter of 2020. For the first six months of 2020 and 2019, investment securities averaged $8.8 billion and $12.6 billion, respectively. The lower average balances in the recent periods reflect maturities of U.S. Treasury notes and pay downs of mortgage-backed securities. There were no significant sales of investment securities during the first six months of 2020 or 2019. During the first quarter of 2019, the Company purchased $500 million of U.S. Treasury notes. There were no other significant purchases of investment securities during the first six months of 2020 or 2019. The Company routinely has increases and decreases in its holdings of capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Those holdings are accounted for at cost and are adjusted based on amounts of outstanding borrowings and available lines of credit with those entities.

The investment securities portfolio is predominantly comprised of residential mortgage-backed securities, short term U.S. Treasury and federal agency notes, and certain other debt and marketable equity securities. Investment securities also include capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its liquidity position and its overall interest-rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including prepayments. The Company may occasionally sell investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads, actual or anticipated prepayments, credit risk associated with a particular security, or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio in connection with a business combination. The amounts of investment securities held by the Company are influenced by factors such as demand for loans, which generally yield more than investment securities and other earning assets, ongoing repayments, the levels of deposits, and management of liquidity and balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios.

Fair value changes in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Net unrealized gains on such equity securities were $7 million in the recent quarter, compared with net unrealized gains of $ 9 million in the second quarter of 2019 and net unrealized losses of $21 million in the initial 2020 quarter. Net unrealized losses on equity securities were $14 million during the first six months of 2020, compared with net unrealized gains of $21 million in the prior year period . Those gains and losses were predominantly related to the Company&#8217;s holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock. 

- 56 -

&#160;

The Company regularly reviews its debt investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be indicative of credit-related losses. In light of such reviews, there were no credit-related losses on debt investment securities recognize d in either of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 or 2019. Based on management&#8217;s assessment of future cash flows associated with individual investment securities as of June 30, 2020, the Company did not expect to incur any material credit-related lo sses in its portfolios of debt investment securities. Additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in notes 2 and 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

Other earning assets include interest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other banks, trading account assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities. Those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged $17.2 billion in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $6.2 billion in the year-earlier quarter and $7.4 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Interest-bearing deposits at banks averaged $ 16.5 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and $ 6.1 billion for each of the three-month periods ended June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2020. The amounts of interest-bearing deposits at banks at the respective dates were predominantly comprised of deposits held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The levels of those deposits often fluctuate due to changes in trust-related deposits and other deposits of commercial entities, purchases or maturities of investment securities, or borrowings to manage the Company&#8217;s liquidity. The higher amount at June 30, 2020 as compared with the earlier dates noted reflects the impact of increased commercial and consumer deposit balances.

As a result of the changes described herein, average earning assets totaled $123.5 billion in the most recent quarter, compared with $107.5 billion in the second quarter of 2019 and $108.2 billion in the initial 2020 quarter. Average earning assets totaled $115.9 billion and $106.8 billion during the first six months of 2020 and 2019 , respectively. 

The most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits. The Company considers noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less as core deposits. The Company&#8217;s branch network is its principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Average core deposits totaled $106.1 billion in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $86.2 billion in the similar 2019 quarter and $90.9 billion in the first quarter of 2020. The increase in average core deposits in the recent quarter as compared with the second quarter of 2019 and 2020&#8217;s initial quarter reflected higher balances of noninterest-bearing deposits and savings and interest-checking deposits. Average balances of savings and interest-checking core deposits rose $8.2 billion or 16% to $59.0 billion in the second 2020 quarter from $50.8 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $12.4 billion or 41% to $42.5 billion in the recent quarter from $30.1 billion in the second 2019 quarter. Those increases were largely due to higher average deposits of commercial customers, but also reflect higher levels of consumer deposits and deposits associated with residential mortgage servicing activities. In late March 2020, commercial customers drew down available lines of credit for liquidity purposes. A large portion of those funds were placed in customer deposit accounts at M&#38;T Bank. By the end of the second quarter, a significant portion of those line advances had been repaid by customers. Average core deposits were $90.9 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Average savings and interest-checking core deposits increased $5.3 billion or 10% in the second 2020 quarter from $53.6 billion in the immediately preceding quarter. Average noninterest-bearing deposits in the recent quarter were $10.0 billion or 31% above the first quarter 2020 average of $32.5 billion predominantly due to higher deposits of commercial customers. The following table provides an analysis of quarterly changes in the components of average core deposits. &#160;

The Company also receives funding from other deposit sources, including branch-related time deposits over $250,000, deposits associated with the Company&#8217;s Cayman Islands office and brokered deposits. Time deposits over $250,000, excluding brokered deposits, averaged $733 million in the recent quarter, compared with $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2019 and $872 million in the initial 2020 quarter. The decreases in such deposits since the second quarter of 2019 were predominantly the result of maturities of higher-rate time deposits. Cayman Islands office deposits averaged $1.0 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion for the quarters ended June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2020, respectively. The decrease in such deposits in the recent quarter as compared with the second quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 reflected customer reaction to the declines in short-term interest rates that followed actions by the Federal Reserve in March 2020. The Company had brokered savings and interest-bearing transaction accounts, which in the aggregate averaged $4.0 billion during the recent quarter, compared with $2.7 billion in each of the second quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. The amounts of Cayman Islands office deposits or brokered deposits is largely dependent on demand by customers and other investors for those types of deposit products.

The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and others as sources of funding. Short-term borrowings represent borrowing arrangements that at the time they were entered into had a contractual maturity of one year or less. Average short-term borrowings totaled $63 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $1.3 billion in the year-earlier quarter and $58 million in the initial 2020 quarter. In general, the higher short-term borrowings in the prior year period were entered into for liquidity management purposes.

Long-term borrowings averaged $6.2 billion in the two most recent quarters and $8.3 billion in the second quarter of 2019. Average balances of outstanding senior notes were $4.1 billion, $5.5 billion and $4.2 billion during the three months ended June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2020, respectively. On January 7, 2020, M&#38;T Bank, the principal bank subsidiary of M&#38;T, redeemed $750 million of fixed rate senior notes that were due to mature on February 6, 2020. In addition, M&#38;T Bank redeemed $750 million of fixed rate senior notes in July 2020 that were due to mature on August 17, 2020. Subordinated capital notes included in long-term borrowings averaged $1.4 billion in each of the three-month periods ended June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2020. Junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average long-term borrowings were $526 million, $523 million and $525 million during the second quarters of 2020 and 2019 and the initial 2020 quarter, respectively. Additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures is provided in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements. Long-term borrowings also included agreements to repurchase securities, which averaged $101 million in each of the first two quarters of 2020 and $373 million in the second quarter of 2019. The repurchase agreement held at June 30, 2020 totaled $100 million and matured in July 2020. 

Net interest income can be impacted by changes in the composition of the Company&#8217;s earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as discussed herein, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads. Net interest spread, or the difference between the taxable-equivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 2.98% in the recent quarter, compared with 3.53% in the second quarter of 2019. The yield on earning assets during the second quarter of 2020 was 3.38%, down 126 basis points from 4.64% in the year-earlier period, while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities declined 71 basis points to .40% in the recent quarter from 1.11% in the year-earlier 

- 59 -

&#160;

period. In the first quarter of 2020, the net interest spread was 3.35%, the yield on earning assets was 4.18% and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was .83%. The narrowing of the net interest spread in the recent quarter as compared with the corresponding 2019 period and the initial quarter of 2020 reflects the impact of the decreases in short-term interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve during the second half of 2019 and in March 2020. For the first six months of 2020, the net interest spread was 3.15%, down 45 basis points from 3.60% in the year-earlier period. The yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing l iabilities for the first half of 2020 were 3.75% and .60%, respectively, compared with 4.68% and 1.08% respectively, in the initial six months of 2019. 

Net interest-free funds consist largely of noninterest-bearing demand deposits and shareholders&#8217; equity, partially offset by bank owned life insurance and non-earning assets, including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets. Net interest-free funds averaged $47.9 billion in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $36.7 billion in the year-earlier quarter and $38.2 billion in the initial 2020 quarter. The increase in average net interest-free funds in the most recent quarter as compared with the prior periods reflects higher average balances of noninterest-bearing deposits. Those deposits averaged $42.5 billion, $30.1 billion and $32.5 billion in the quarters ended June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2020, respectively. The rise in such balances in the recent quarter as compared with the earlier periods was largely due to increased levels of deposits of commercial customers. During the first six months of 2020 and 2019, average net interest-free funds aggregated $43.1 billion and $36.9 billion, respectively. Shareholders&#8217; equity averaged $16.0 billion, during the three-month period ended June 30, 2020, $15.6 billion during the year-earlier period and $15.7 billion during the initial 2020 quarter. Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged $4.6 billion in each of the two most recent quarters and in the quarter ended June 30, 2019. The cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged $1.8 billion in each of the three-month periods ended June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2020. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance and benefits received are not included in interest income, but rather are recorded in &#8220;other revenues from operations.&#8221; The contribution of net interest-free funds to net interest margin was .15% in the second quarter of 2020, compared with .38% and .30% in the second quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, respectively. The reduced contribution of net interest-free funds to net interest margin in the two most recent quarters as compared with the second quarter of 2019 reflects the lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities used to value net interest-free funds. The contribution of net interest-free funds in the first half of 2020 and 2019 was .22% and .37%, respectively.

Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of net interest-free funds as described herein, the Company&#8217;s net interest margin was 3.13% in the second quarter of 2020, compared with 3.91% in the year-earlier period and 3.65% in the initial quarter of 2020. During the first six months of 2020 and 2019, the net interest margin was 3.37% and 3.97%, respectively. Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition of the Company&#8217;s portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads, could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s net interest income and net interest margin.

Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields on earning assets or the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $16.4 billion (excluding $40.9 billion of forward-starting swap agreements) at June 30, 2020, $17.8 billion (excluding $21.4 billion of forward-starting swap agreements) at June 30, 2019 and $17.2 billion (excluding $40.4 billion of forward-starting swap agreements) at December 31, 2019. Under the terms of those interest rate swap agreements, the Company received payments based on the outstanding notional amount at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates. Interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of $13.35 billion that were in effect at each of June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2019 were serving as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans. At June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2019, interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of $3.05 billion, $4.45 billion and $3.80 billion, respectively, were serving as fair value hedges of fixed rate long-term borrowings. The Company has entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements predominantly to extend the term of its interest rate swap agreements serving as cash flow hedges, and provide a hedge against changing interest rates on certain of its variable rate loans.

- 60 -

&#160;

In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the interest rate sw ap agreement) and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair value of the interest ra te swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded as an adjustment to the interest income or interest expense of the respective hedged item. In a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative&#8217;s gain or los s is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the derivative&#8217;s gain or loss on cash flow hedges is accounted fo r similar to that associated with fair value hedges. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized during each of the quarters ended June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2020 were not material to the Company&#8217;s consolidated results of operations. Information regarding the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and hedge ineffectiveness is presented in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items primarily resu lt from the effects of changing interest rates and spreads. 

The weighted-average rates to be received and paid under interest rate swap agreements currently in effect were 2.56% and .28%, respectively, at June 30, 2020. The average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes, the related effect on net interest income and margin, and the weighted-average interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in the accompanying table. Additional information about the Company&#8217;s use of interest rate swap agreements and other derivatives is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.

In addition to interest rate swap agreements, the Company had entered into interest rate floor agreements that were accounted for in the tr ading account rather than as hedging instruments but, nevertheless, provided the Company with protection against the possibility of future declines in interest rates on earning assets. At each of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2019, outstanding notional a mounts of such agreements totaled $15.6 billion. The interest rate floor agreements matured during the first quarter of 2020. 

As a financial intermediary, the Company is exposed to various risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Company&#8217;s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ. Core deposits represent the most significant source of funding for the Company and are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That customer base has, over the past several years, become more geographically diverse as a result of expansion of the Company&#8217;s businesses. Nevertheless, the Company faces competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. The Company supplements funding provided through deposits with various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including overnight federal funds purchased, short-term advances from the FHLB of New York, brokered deposits, Cayman Islands office deposits and longer-term borrowings . M&#38;T Bank has access to additional funding sources through borrowings from the FHLB of New York, lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, M&#38;T Bank&#8217;s Bank Note Program, and other available borrowing facilities. The Bank Note Program enables M&#38;T Bank to offer unsecured senior and subordinated notes. The Company has, from time to time, also issued subordinated capital notes and junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios. The Company&#8217;s junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities and other subordinated capital notes are considered Tier 2 capital and are includable in total regulatory capital. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, long-term borrowings aggregated $6.3 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively. 

Short-term federal funds borrowings outstanding were $3.2 billion at June 30, 2019. There were no such borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2020 or December 31, 2019. In general, those borrowings were unsecured, matured on the next business day and were entered into for liquidity management purposes. While predominantly used to satisfy customer demand, Cayman Islands office deposits may also be used by the Company as an alternative to short-term borrowings. Cayman Islands office deposits totaled $868 million at June 30, 2020, $1.4 billion at June 30, 2019 and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2019. The Company has also benefited from the placement of brokered deposits. The Company had brokered savings and interest-bearing checking deposit accounts which aggregated approximately $4.0 billion at June 30, 2020, $2.7 billion at June 30, 2019 and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2019. Brokered time deposits were not a significant source of funding as of those dates.

The Company&#8217;s ability to obtain funding from these sources could be negatively impacted should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets. The Company attempts to quantify such impact by performing stress tests that assess the effect on liquidity resulting from various levels of internal and external stress factors. The liquidity impact of such events is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash generated from operations, such as fees collected for services.

&#160;

Certain customers of the Company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds (&#8220;VRDBs&#8221;). The VRDBs are generally enhanced by letters of credit provided by M&#38;T Bank. M&#38;T Bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the VRDBs and, at its discretion, may from time-to-time own some of the VRDBs while such instruments are remarketed. When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading account assets in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. Nevertheless, M&#38;T Bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the VRDBs. The value of VRDBs in the Company&#8217;s trading account was not material at June 30, 2020 or December 31, 2019. The total amounts of VRDBs out standing backed by M&#38;T Bank letters of credit were $861 million at June 30, 2020, compared with $847 million at June 30, 2019 and $857 million at December 31, 2019 . M&#38;T Bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds. 

The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business that require future cash payments. Such obligations include, among others, payments related to deposits, borrowings, leases and other contractual commitments. Off-balance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity, including commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate loans. Because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.

M&#38;T&#8217;s primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory limitations. Dividends from any bank subsidiary to M&#38;T are limited by the amount of earnings of the subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of that test, at June 30, 2020 approximately $634 million was available for payment of dividends to M&#38;T from bank subsidiaries. M&#38;T also may obtain funding through long-term borrowings. Outstanding senior notes of M&#38;T at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were $790 million and $770 million, respectively. Junior subordinated debentures of M&#38;T associated with trust preferred securities outstanding at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 totaled $527 million and $525 million, respectively. 

Management closely monitors the Company&#8217;s liquidity position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs. Management does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long-term, for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either M&#38;T or its subsidiary banks.

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices and/or interest rates of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments. The primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises from the Company&#8217;s core banking activities of lending and deposit-taking, because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and derivatives used to manage interest rate risk. Management&#8217;s philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a &#8220;value of equity&#8221; model to supplement the modeling technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a long-term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At June 30, 2020, the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes that were currently in effect was $16.4 billion. In addition, the Company has entered into $40.9 billion of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements.

The Company&#8217;s Asset-Liability Commi ttee, which includes members of senior management, monitors the sensitivity of the Company&#8217;s net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios. In m odeling changing interest rates, the Company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel (that is, simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve) and non-parallel (that is, allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts) shifts in the yield curve. In utilizing the model, market-implied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios. The model considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit-gathering activities, as well as interrelations hips in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate ris k through the use of on- or off-balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes. 

The accompanying table as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 displays the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year.

The Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgage-related assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non-trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. In the scenarios presented, the Company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelve-month period as compared with the base scenario. In the declining rate scenario, the rate changes may be limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates remain at or above zero on all points of the yield curve. The assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes.

Changes in fair value of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets. That impact is most notable on the values assigned to some of the Company&#8217;s investment securities. Information about the fair valuation of investment securities is presented in notes 2 and 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company engages in limited trading account activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to fund the Company&#8217;s obligations under certain deferred compensation plans. Financial instruments utilized for trading account activities consist predominantly of interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swap agreements, and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading account activities by entering into offsetting trading positions that are also included in the trading account. The fair values of trading account positions associated with interest rate contracts and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts are presented in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. The amounts 

- 64 -

&#160;

of gross and net trading account positions, as well as the type of trading account activities conducted by the Company, are subject to a well-defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by management and approved by M&#38;T&#8217;s Board of Dir ectors. However, as with any non-government guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the Company&#8217;s trading account activities. 

The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading account purposes totaled $37.1 billion at June 30, 2020, $44.4 billion at June 30, 2019 and $48.6 billion at December 31, 2019. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading account purposes were $1.0 billion at June 30, 2020, compared with $949 million at June 30, 2019 and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Although the notional amounts of these contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, the unsettled fair values of all financial instruments used for trading account activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of all trading account assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet were $1.3 billion and $138 million, respectively, at June 30, 2020 and $470 million and $80 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. The fair value asset and liability amounts at June 30, 2020 have been reduced by contractual settlements of $3 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, and at December 31, 2019 have been reduced by contractual settlements of $43 million and $281 million, respectively. The higher balance of trading account assets at June 30, 2020 as compared with December 31, 2019 was largely the result of increased values associated with interest rate swap agreements entered into with commercial customers that are not subject to periodic variation margin settlement payments. Included in trading account assets were assets related to deferred compensation plans aggregating $20 million at June 30, 2020 and $21 million at each of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2019. Changes in the fair values of such assets are recorded as &#8220;trading account and foreign exchange gains&#8221; in the consolidated statement of income. Included in &#8220;other liabilities&#8221; in the consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2020 were $23 million of liabilities related to deferred compensation plans, compared with $24 million at June 30, 2019 and $25 million at December 31, 2019. Changes in the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in &#8220;other costs of operations&#8221; in the consolidated statement of income. Also included in trading account assets were investments in mutual funds and other assets that the Company was required to hold under terms of certain non-qualified supplemental retirement and other benefit plans that were assumed by the Company in various acquisitions. Those assets totaled $29 million at June 30, 2020, $27 million at June 30, 2019 and $28 million at December 31, 2019.

Given the Company&#8217;s policies, limits and positions, management believes that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk associated with trading account activities was not material, however, as previously noted, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to transactions related to the Company&#8217;s trading account activities. Additional information about the Company&#8217;s use of derivative financial instruments in its trading account activities is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Provision for Credit Losses

As described in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements, effective January 1, 2020 the Company adopted amended accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. That guidance requires an allowance for credit losses to be deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net carrying value that is expected to be collected over the contractual term of the assets considering relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. The new guidance replaces the previous incurred loss model for determining the allowance for credit losses. The adoption of the amended guidance resulted in a $132 million increase in the allowance for credit losses at January 1, 2020. Increases in the allowance for residential real estate loans and consumer loans, reflecting the longer-dated maturities of such portfolios, were offset somewhat by net decreases in the allowance for commercial loans resulting from lower loss estimates on demand loan products due to the assumption that the Company could require full repayment of such loans in the near-term. The following table depicts the changes in the allowance for credit losses by loan category resulting from the adoption of the amended guidance.

The amended guidance requires estimated credit losses on loans acquired at a discount to be reflected in the allowance for credit losses. Previously, such losses were netted in the carrying value of the loans unless there was an increased loss expectation subsequent to their acquisition. The gross-up of the estimated losses on loans acquired at a discount that was previously not recognized in the allowance for credit losses was $18 million on January 1, 2020. Prior to January 1, 2020, the Company generally recognized interest income on loans acquired at a discount regardless of the borrowers&#8217; repayment status. Effective with the adoption of the new accounting guidance, the Company&#8217;s nonaccrual loan policy now applies to loans acquired at a discount. Loans acquired at a discount at December 31, 2019 included $171 million of loans that, effective with the adoption of the new guidance, were classified as non-accrual loans on January 1, 2020.

A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. The provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 2020 was $325 million, compared with $55 million in the year-earlier quarter and $250 million in the initial quarter of 2020. As noted earlier, the significant increases in the provision in the two most recent quarters as compared with the second quarter of 2019 follow the adoption of new accounting guidance on January 1, 2020 and reflect updated economic assumptions and projections that considered the deteriorating macroeconomic outlook resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic as of the end of each of the first two quarters of 2020. Net charge-offs of loans were $71 million in the recent quarter, compared with $44 million and $49 million in the second quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, respectively. Net charge-offs as an annualized percentage of average loans and leases were .29% in the second quarter of 2020, .20% in the year-earlier quarter and .22% in the initial 2020 quarter. Excluding loans associated with the PPP, which are guaranteed by the SBA, net charge-offs for the recent quarter were .31% of average loans outstanding. Net charge-offs for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 were $120 million and $67 million, respectively, representing an annualized .26% and .15%, repectively, of average loans and leases. A summary of net charge-offs by loan type is presented in the table that follows.

Included in net charge-offs of consumer loans were net charge-offs of: automobile loans of $9 million in the recent quarter, $6 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $7 million in the first quarter of 2020&#59; recreational finance loans of $5 million in the second quarter of 2020, $5 million in the year-earlier quarter and $9 million in the initial 2020 quarter&#59; and home equity loans and lines of credit secured by one-to-four family residential properties of less than $1 million in the recent quarter, $1 million in last year&#8217;s second quarter and $2 million in the first quarter of 2020. 

Nonaccrual loans aggregated $1.16 billion or 1.18% of total loans and leases outstanding at June 30, 2020, compared with $1.06 billion or 1.13% at March 31, 2020 and $1.13 billion or 1.25% at January 1, 2020. The adoption of the new accounting guidance resulted in an increase in nonaccrual loans on January 1, 2020 of approximately $171 million. Previously such loans would have been classified as either purchased impaired loans or acquired accruing loans past due 90 days or more. Loans classified as nonaccrual at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2019 totaled $865 million and $963 million, respectively, or .96% and 1.06% of total loans outstanding.

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were $536 million or .55% of loans and leases at June 30, 2020, compared with $530 million or .56% at March 31, 2020. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more (excluding loans acquired at a discount) were $349 million or .39% of total loans outstanding at June 30, 2019 and $519 million or .57% of outstanding loans at December 31, 2019. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more included loans guaranteed by government-related entities of $454 million, $320 million, $480 million and $464 million at June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019, December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020, respectively. Guaranteed loans included one-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company that were repurchased to reduce associated servicing costs, including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors. Despite the loans being purchased by the Company, the insurance or guarantee by the applicable government-related entity remains in force. The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans that are guaranteed by government-related entities totaled $428 million at June 30, 2020, $300 million a year earlier, $452 million at December 31, 2019 and $439 million at March 31, 2020. The increase in such loans since June 30, 2019 resulted largely from loans associated with servicing the Company added in 2019. The remaining accruing loans past due 90 days or more not guaranteed by government-related entities were loans considered to be with creditworthy borrowers that were in the process of collection or renewal.

Loans that were 30-89 days past due were $618 million at June 30, 2020, compared with $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019 and $1.4 billion at March 31, 2020. The lower level of such past due loans at the recent quarter end was a result of loan paydowns, many of which resulted in return to current status, and migrations of loans to nonaccrual status. COVID-19 related payment deferral modifications, which largely occurred in the second quarter of 2020, resulted in such loans being classified as current in accordance with regulatory guidance and, as a result, did not contribute in incremental additions to loans categorized as 30-89 days past due.

Prior to the adoption of the new accounting standard on January 1, 2020, the Company reported purchased impaired loans. Those loans were impaired at the date of acquisition, were recorded at estimated fair value and were generally delinquent in payments, but, in accordance with GAAP, the Company continued to accrue interest income on such loans based on the estimated expected cash flows associated with the loans. The amended accounting guidance requires estimated credit losses on loans acquired at a discount to now be reflected in the allowance for credit losses and effective with the adoption of the guidance, the Company&#8217;s nonaccrual loan policy now applies to such loans. The

carrying amount of purchased impaired loans was $263 million at June 30, 2019 and $228 million a t December 31, 2019. 

The United States has been operating under a state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic since March 13, 2020. The direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a dramatic reduction in economic activity that has severely hampered the ability of some businesses and consumers to meet their repayment obligations. The CARES Act, in addition to providing financial assistance to both businesses and consumers, created a forbearance program for federally-backed mortgage loans, protects borrowers from negative credit reporting due to loan accommodations related to the national emergency, and provides financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings for a limited period of time to account for the effects of COVID-19. The banking regulatory agencies have likewise issued guidance encouraging financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are, or may be, unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of COVID-19. That guidance, with concurrence of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and provisions of the CARES Act, allow modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were generally current with their payments prior to any relief, to not be treated as troubled debt restructurings. Modifications may include payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment. The Company continues to work with its customers affected by COVID-19 and, as previously noted, has granted a significant amount of modifications across many of its loan portfolios. To the extent that such modifications met the criteria previously described, such modifications have not been classified as troubled debt restructurings. 

The Company also modified the terms of select loans in an effort to assist borrowers that were not related to the COVID-19 pandemic. If the borrower was experiencing financial difficulty and a concession was granted, the Company considered such modifications as troubled debt restructurings. Loan modifications included such actions as the extension of loan maturity dates and the lowering of interest rates and monthly payments. The objective of the modifications was to increase loan repayments by customers and thereby reduce net charge-offs. The modified loans are included in impaired loans for purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses. Information about modifications of loans that are considered troubled debt restructurings is included in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Residential real estate loans modified under specified loss mitigation programs prescribed by government guarantors that were not related to the COVID-19 pandemic have not been included in renegotiated loans because the loan guarantee remains in full force and, accordingly, the Company has not granted a concession with respect to the ultimate collection of the original loan balance. Such loans aggregated $188 million, $199 million, and $203 million at June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2019, respectively.

Commercial loans and leases classified as nonaccrual totaled $285 million, $224 million, $347 million, and $287 million at June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019, December 31, 2019, and March 31, 2020, respectively. The decline in such loans from December 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020 predominantly resulted from payments received from borrowers. Commercial real estate loans in nonaccrual status aggregated $260 million, $242 million, $195 million and $227 million at June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019, December 31, 2019, and March 31, 2020, respectively.

Nonaccrual residential real estate loans totaled $426 million at June 30, 2020, compared with $298 million at June 30, 2019, $319 million at December 31, 2019 and $413 million at March 31, 2020. The increase at the end of the first two quarters of 2020 as compared with the prior year dates is largely reflective of the impact of the adoption of the amended accounting guidance as noted earlier. Included in residential real estate loans classified as nonaccrual were limited documentation first mortgage loans of $119 million at each of June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, compared with $88 million at June 30, 2019 and $83 million at December 31, 2019. Limited documentation first mortgage loans represent loans secured by residential real estate that at origination typically included some form of limited borrower documentation requirements as compared with more traditional loans. The Company no longer originates limited documentation loans. Residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest (excluding loans acquired at a discount at the 2019 dates) aggregated $479 million at June 30, 2020, compared with $322 million at June 30, 2019, $487 million at December 31, 2019 and $474 million at March 31, 2020. A substantial portion of such amounts related to repurchased government-guaranteed loans, including the previously noted

&#160;

repurchases of loans associated with servicing that the Company added in 2019. Given the COVID-19 modifications, the Company expects that repurchases of loans associated with servicing could increase in the coming months of 2020. Information about the location of non accrual and charged-off residential real estate loans as of and for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 is presented in the accompanying table. 

Nonaccrual consumer loans were $187 million at June 30, 2020, compared with $101 million at June 30, 2019, $102 million at December 31, 2019 and $135 million at March 31, 2020. Included in nonaccrual consumer loans at June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019, December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020 were: automobile loans of $43 million, $20 million, $21 million and $19 million, respectively&#59; recreational finance loans of $24 million, $11 million, $14 million and $13 million, respectively&#59; and outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit of $77 million, $67 million, $63 million and $63 million, respectively. Information about the location of nonaccrual and charged-off home equity loans and lines of credit as of and for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 is presented in the accompanying table.

Information about past due and nonaccrual loans as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 is also included in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Real estate and other foreclosed assets totaled $67 million at June 30, 2020, compared with $73 million at June 30, 2019, $86 million at December 31, 2019 and $84 million at March 31, 2020. Net gains or losses associated with real estate and other foreclo sed assets were not material during the three-months ended June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019 or March 31, 2019 . At June 30, 2020, the Company&#8217;s holdings of residential real estate-related properties comprised approximately 88% of foreclosed assets. During the COVID-19 pandemic, government authorities have restricted the ability of mortgage servicers to initiate foreclosure procedures. 

A comparative summary of nonperforming assets and certain past due, renegotiated and impaired loan data and credit quality ratios is presented in the accompanying table.

(a) Predominantly residential real estate loans. Prior to 2020, excludes loans acquired at a discount. 

(b) 

Prior to 2020, loans acquired at a discount that were recorded at fair value at acquisition date. This category does not include purchased impaired loans that are presented separately.

(c) 

Prior to 2020, accruing loans acquired at a discount that were impaired at acquisition date and recorded at fair value.

Beginning in 2020, management determines the allowance for credit losses under new accounting guidance that requires estimating the amount of current expected credit losses over the remaining contractual term of the loan and leases portfolio. A description of the methodologies used by the Company to estimate its allowance for credit losses in 2020 can be found in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. For periods prior to 2020, a description of the methodologies used by the Company for determining the allowance for credit losses may be found in the Provision for Credit Losses section of Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in M&#38;T&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.

- 71 -

&#160;

In establishing the allowance for credit losses subsequent to December 31, 2019, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits identified through both normal and tar geted credit review processes and also estimates losses for other loans and leases with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. For purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company evaluates its loan and lease portfolio by loan type. At the time of the Company&#8217;s analysis regarding the determination of the allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2020 , there existed substantial concerns about the continued economic decline related to the COVID-19 pandemic&#59; the volatile nature of global commodity and export markets, including the impact international economic conditions could have on the U.S. economy&#59; Federal Reserve positioning of monetary policy&#59; and continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions (approximately 52 % of the Company&#8217;s loans and leases are to customers in New York State and Pennsylvania). The Company utilizes a loan grading system to differentiate risk amongst its commercial loans and commercial real es tate loans. Loans with a lower expectation of default are assigned one of ten possible &#8220;pass&#8221; loan grades and through the loss estimation modeling and other techniques used by the Company are generally considered to possess lower expected losses when dete rmining the allowance for credit losses. Loans with an elevated level of credit risk are classified as &#8220;criticized&#8221; and are ascribed higher expected loss amounts when determining the allowance for credit losses. Criticized loans may be classified as &#8220;nonac crual&#8221; if the Company no longer expects to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company re-graded a significant portion of its commerc ial loans and commercial real estate loans, particularly those that were modified as a result of COVID-19 impacts. Criticized commercial loans and commercial real estate loans totaled $6.2 billion at June 30, 2020, compared with $ 2.8 billion at June 30 , 2019, $2.5 billion at December 31, 2019, and $2.4 billion at March 31, 2020. The rise in criticized loans at the recent quarter-end as compared to March 31, 2020 reflects the impact of the pandemic on borrowers&#8217; financial condition and the re-grading o f loans by the Company. The declines from the second quarter of 2019 to the end of 2019&#8217;s final quarter and the first quarter of 2020 reflect payments received on criticized loans during 2019 and early 2020 and the removal of loans to customers experienci ng improved financial condition . 

The governmental responses to COVID-19 have led to a significant reduction in economic activity that has been detrimental to many businesses across the Company&#8217;s geographic regions. As a result, borrowers have been and will likely be significantly impacted by the shut-downs caused by the March 13, 2020 nationwide state of emergency resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Summaries of the commercial loan and lease and commercial real estate loan portfolios as of June 30, 2020 are provided below.

Loan officers in different geographic locations with the support of the Company&#8217;s credit department personnel review and reassign loan grades based on their detailed knowledge of individual borrowers and the regions in which they operate. The Company re-assessed its loan grades for those borrowers most impacted by COVID-19 in the second quarter of 2020 and expects that loans will continue to be re-graded in subsequent period as more information becomes available. At least annually, however, updated financial information is obtained from commercial borrowers associated with pass grade loans and additional analysis is performed. On a quarterly basis, the Company&#8217;s centralized credit department reviews all criticized commercial loans and commercial real estate loans greater than $1 million to determine the appropriateness of the assigned loan grade, including whether the loan should be reported as accruing or nonaccruing. For criticized nonaccrual loans, additional meetings are held with loan officers and their managers, workout specialists and senior management to discuss each of the relationships. In analyzing criticized loans, borrower-specific information is reviewed, including operating results, future cash flows, recent developments and the borrower&#8217;s outlook, and other pertinent data. The timing and extent of potential losses, considering collateral valuation and other factors, and the Company&#8217;s potential courses of action are contemplated.

With regard to residential real estate loans, the Company&#8217;s loss identification and estimation techniques make reference to loan performance and house price data in specific areas of the country where collateral securing the Company&#8217;s residential real estate loans is located. For residential real estate-related loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, the excess of the loan balance over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan is charged-off when the loan becomes 150 days delinquent. That charge-off is based on recent indications of value from external parties that are generally obtained shortly after a loan becomes nonaccrual. Loans to consumers that file for bankruptcy are generally charged off to estimated net collateral value shortly after the Company is notified of such filings. At June 30, 2020, approximately 60% of the Company&#8217;s home equity portfolio consisted of first lien loans and lines of credit. Of the remaining junior lien loans in the portfolio, approximately 60% (or approximately 23% of the aggregate home equity portfolio) consisted of junior lien loans that were behind a first lien mortgage loan that was not owned or serviced by the Company. To the extent known by the Company, if a senior lien loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency, even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the Company, the junior lien

&#160;

loan or line that is owned by the Company is placed on nonaccrual status. At June 30, 2020, the balance of junior lien loans and lines that were in nonaccrual status solely as a result of first lien loan performance was $4 million , compared with $5 million at June 30, 2019 and $6 million at each of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020. In monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses, the Compa ny reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent charge-off experience. When evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for charge off and for purposes of estimating incurred losses in determining the allowance for cr edit losses, the Company gives consideration to the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property. Home equity line of credit terms vary but such lines are generally originated with an open draw period of ten years followed by an amortization period of up to twenty years. At June 30, 2020, approximately 83% of all outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit related to lines that were still in the draw period, the weighted-average remaining draw periods were approxima tely six years, and approximately 18% were making contractually allowed payments that do not include any repayment of principal. 

Factors that influence the Company&#8217;s credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Company&#8217;s real estate loan portfolios. Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, and general economic conditions affecting consumers.

The Company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. To estimate expected losses, the Company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The Company&#8217;s approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases at June 30, 2020, March 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020 included utilizing macro-economic assumptions to project losses over a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. Subsequent to the forecast period, the Company reverted to longer-term historical loss experience, over a period of one year, to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life. Forward-looking estimates of certain macro-economic variables are determined by the M&#38;T Scenario Development Group, which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists. Changes in the forecasted economic assumptions from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 primarily reflect the projected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The assumptions utilized as of June 30, 2020 reflected a longer period of economic recovery than previously assumed. Those assumptions included a decline in the unemployment rate in the third quarter of 2020 to approximately 9% from a peak of nearly 14% in the second quarter of 2020, followed by a sustained high single-digit unemployment rate through 2022. The forecast also assumed gross domestic product to contract nearly 7% in 2020 and to then recover to pre-pandemic levels by the second quarter of 2022. Commercial real estate prices were assumed to decline by 15% in the first forecast year, followed by improvement. Residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate significantly. The forecast at March 31, 2020 reflected a sharp contraction of economic activity in the second quarter of 2020 resulting in a projected unemployment rate of 9.3% and an annualized rate of decrease in gross domestic product as low as 26.1% with a decrease of 2.9% during 2020. Additionally, commercial real estate prices were anticipated to decline by an average of 15.6% in the first forecast year, followed by improvement of 9.8% in year 2. The forecast utilized as of March 31 contemplated a significant economic recovery beginning in the third quarter of 2020. The assumptions utilized as of January 1, 2020 at the time of adoption of the expected credit loss accounting standard were significantly less severe. Those assumptions anticipated unemployment rates that averaged under 4% and steady growth in gross domestic product of 3.3% over the eight quarter forecast period. Forecasted changes in real estate prices as of that date were not significant. The assumptions utilized were based on information available to the Company at or near June 30, 2020, March 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020 at the time it was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dates.

In establishing the allowance for credit loss es the Company also considers the impact of portfolio concentrations, changes in underwriting practices, product expansions into new markets, imprecision in its economic forecasts, geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that influence its loss esti mation process. Geopolitical conditions assessed at June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020 included the potential impact of COVID-19 on economic activity that could influence the ability of customers to repay loan amounts in accordance with their contractual ob ligations. With respect to economic forecasts the Company assessed the likelihood of alternative economic scenarios during the two-year reasonable and supportable time period and of more negative or positive outcomes on its allowance for credit losses. Ec onomic forecasts have changed rapidly in the recent past due to the uncertain impacts of COVID-19. Generally, an increase in unemployment rate or a decrease in any of the rate of positive change in gross domestic product, commercial real estate prices or home prices would have an adverse impact on expected credit losses and would likely result in an increase to the allowance for credit losses. 

Further information about the Company&#8217;s methodology to estimate expected credit losses is included in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2020 appropriately reflected expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for credit losses totaled $1.64 billion at June 30, 2020 and $1.38 billion at March 31, 2020, compared with $1.18 billion on January 1, 2020 when the new accounting pronouncement became effective. The increases in the allowance for credit losses during the first and second quarters of 2020 were primarily the result of deteriorating forecasted economic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The allowance for credit losses totaled $1.03 billion at June 30, 2019, and $1.05 billion at December 31, 2019. As a percentage of loans and leases outstanding, the allowance was 1.68% at June 30, 2020, compared with 1.47% at March 31, 2020, 1.30% at January 1, 2020, 1.15% as of June 30, 2019 and 1.16% at December 31, 2019. Excluding the impact of government-guaranteed PPP loans originated by the Company in the second quarter of 2020, the allowance as a percentage of total loans and leases at June 30, 2020 was 1.79%. The level of the allowance reflects management&#8217;s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors previously referred to. Should the various economic forecasts and credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should management&#8217;s assessment of losses in the loan portfolio also change, the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods. The reported level of the allowance reflects management&#8217;s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date.

Other Income

Other income totaled $487 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $512 million in the year-earlier quarter and $529 million in the first quarter of 2020. The lower level of such income in the most recent quarter as compared with the prior periods reflects declines in service charges on deposit accounts, trading account and foreign exchange gains, merchant discount and credit card fees, and loan syndication fees, partially offset by higher residential mortgage banking revenues and trust income. During the first quarter of 2020, $23 million of income was received from Bayview Lending Group LLC, offsetting the impact of $21 million of unrealized losses on investment securities on total other income during that quarter.

Mortgage banking revenues were $145 million in the recent quarter, compared with $107 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $128 million in the initial 2020 quarter. Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities. The Company&#8217;s involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities includes the origination, sales and servicing of loans under the multi-family loan programs of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Residential mortgage banking revenues, consisting of realized gains from sales of residential real estate loans and loan servicing rights, unrealized gains and losses on residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments, residential real estate loan servicing fees, and other residential real estate loan-related fees and income, were $111 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $72 million in the similar quarter of 2019 and $98 million in the first 2020 quarter. As compared with the second quarter of 2019 and the immediately preceeding quarter, the higher residential mortgage banking revenues in the recent quarter resulted from increased gains associated with loans held for sale and related commitments, reflecting higher origination volumes and improved margins.

&#160;

New commitments to originate residential real estate loans to be sold were approximately $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $723 million in the year-earlier quarter and $919 million in the initial 2020 quarter. Realized gains from sales of residential real estate loans and loan servicing rights and recognized net unrealized gains or losses attributable to residential real estate loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans totaled to ga ins of $52 million in the second quarter of 2020, $13 million in the corresponding period of 2019 and $31 million in 2020&#8217;s first quarter. 

Loans held for sale that were secured by residential real estate aggregated $440 million at June 30, 2020, $294 million at June 30, 2019 and $414 million at December 31, 2019. Commitments to sell residential real estate loans and commitments to originate residential real estate loans for sale at pre-determined rates totaled $986 million and $1.03 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2020, compared with $626 million and $473 million, respectively, at June 30, 2019 and $713 million and $423 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Net recognized unrealized gains on residential real estate loans held for sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate loans for sale were $43 million and $9 million at June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively, compared with $12 million at December 31, 2019. Changes in net unrealized gains or losses are recorded in mortgage banking revenues and resulted in net increases in revenues of $26 million in the recent quarter, $2 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $5 million in the first quarter of 2020.

Revenues from servicing residential real estate loans for others were $59 million during each of the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, compared with $67 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020. Residential real estate loans serviced for others totaled $95.1 billion at June 30, 2020, $102.9 billion at June 30, 2019, $95.1 billion at December 31, 2019 and $93.5 billion at March 31, 2020. Reflected in residential real estate loans serviced for others were loans sub-serviced for others of $64.7 billion, $68.7 billion, $62.8 billion and $61.9 billion at June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019, December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020, respectively. Revenues earned for sub-servicing loans totaled $34 million during the recent quarter, compared with $29 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $37 million in the first quarter of 2020. During the first and second quarters of 2020, the Company added approximately $2.0 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively, to its residential mortgage loan sub-servicing portfolio. The Company added approximately $16.6 billion to its residential mortgage loan sub-servicing portfolio during the second quarter of 2019 and another $1.0 billion was added during the fourth quarter of 2019. The contractual servicing rights associated with loans sub-serviced by the Company were predominantly held by affiliates of BLG. Information about the Company&#8217;s relationship with BLG and its affiliates is included in note 14 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets totaled $211 million at June 30, 2020 (net of a $27 million valuation allowance), $245 million at June 30, 2019 (net of a $9 million valuation allowance), $237 million at December 31, 2019 (net of a $7 million valuation allowance) and $224 million at March 31, 2020 (net of a $17 million valuation allowance). A provision for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $10 million was recorded in each of the first and second quarters of 2020, and a similar charge of $9 million was recorded during the second quarter of 2019. Those provisions resulted from changes in the estimated fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights that reflected the impact of lower interest rates on the expected rate of residential mortgage loan prepayments.

Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $34 million in the recent quarter, compared with $35 million and $30 million in the second quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020, respectively. Included in such amounts were revenues from loan origination and sales activities of $19 million in the second quarter of 2020, $21 million in the year-earlier quarter and $14 million in the first quarter of 2020. Commercial real estate loans originated for sale to other investors were approximately $729 million in the recent quarter, compared with $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2019 and $611 million in the first quarter of 2020. Loan servicing revenues totaled $15 million and $16 million in the second and first quarters of 2020, respectively, compared with $14 million in the second 2019 quarter. Capitalized commercial mortgage servicing assets were $128 million and $117 million at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $131 million at December 31, 2019. Commercial real estate loans serviced for other investors totaled $21.4 billion at June 30, 2020, $19.6 billion at June 30, 2019 and $21.0 billion at December 31, 2019. Those servicing amounts included $3.9 billion at each of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and $3.6 billion at June 30, 2019, of loan balances for which investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are ultimately uncollectible. Commitments

&#160;

to sell commercial real estate loans and commitments to originate commercial real estate loans for sale were $492 million and $237 million, respectively, at June 30, 2020, $751 million and $247 million , respectively, at June 30, 2019 and $193 million and $164 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Commercial real estate loans held for sale at June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2019 were $ 255 million, $ 504 million and $ 28 million, respectively. 

Service charges on deposit accounts were $77 million and $108 million in the second quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $106 million in the first quarter of 2020. The decrease in such service charges in the recent quarter as compared with the preceding quarters resulted from lower consumer service charges, predominantly resulting from COVID-19 related fee waivers and lower debit card and other customer transaction activity, and decreased commercial service charges, largely due to higher customer deposit levels that can be used by those customers to offset transaction-related fees.

Trust income includes fees related to two significant businesses. The Institutional Client Services (&#8220;ICS&#8221;) business provides a variety of trustee, agency, investment management and administrative services for corporations and institutions, investment bankers, corporate tax, finance and legal executives, and other institutional clients who: (i) use capital markets financing structures&#59; (ii) use independent trustees to hold retirement plan and other assets&#59; and (iii) need investment and cash management services. The Wealth Advisory Services (&#8220;WAS&#8221;) business helps high net worth clients grow their wealth, protect it, and transfer it to their heirs. A comprehensive array of wealth management services are offered, including asset management, fiduciary services and family office services. Trust income aggregated $152 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $144 million in the year-earlier quarter and $149 million in the first quarter of 2020. Revenues associated with the ICS business were approximately $85 million during each of the two most recent quarters, compared with $77 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2019. The higher revenues in the most recent quarter as compared with the year-earlier quarter reflect the impact of higher sales activities and increased retirement services income resulting from growth in collective fund balances. Revenues attributable to WAS totaled approximately $60 million during each of the three-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 and $56 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020. The higher revenues in the recent quarter as compared with the first quarter of 2020 reflected annual tax service fees earned for assisting customers with their tax filings. Trust assets under management were $114.4 billion, $97.6 billion, $103.6 billion and $113.0 billion at June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Trust assets under management include the Company&#8217;s proprietary mutual funds&#8217; assets of $12.6 billion, $11.8 billion, $12.8 billion and $12.5 billion at June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019, March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Additional trust income from investment management activities was $7 million in each of the second quarters of 2020 and 2019, compared with $8 million in the initial 2020 quarter and is predominantly comprised of fees earned from retail customer investment accounts.

Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees, totaled $10 million in the recent quarter, compared with $12 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $13 million in the first quarter of 2020. Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $8 million, $18 million and $21 million during the quarters ended June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2020, respectively. The lower gains in the recent quarter as compared with the prior quarters were predominantly due to decreased activity related to interest rate swap agreements executed on behalf of commercial customers. The Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange contracts with customers who need such services and concomitantly enters into offsetting trading positions with third parties to minimize the risks involved with these types of transactions. Information about the notional amount of interest rate, foreign exchange and other contracts entered into by the Company for trading account purposes is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements and herein under the heading &#8220;Taxable-equivalent Net Interest Income.&#8221;

The Company recognized net gains on investment securities of $7 million in the recent quarter and $9 million in the second quarter of 2019, compared with net losses of $21 million in the first quarter of 2020. The gains and losses represented unrealized gains and losses on investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock.

Other revenues from operations were $87 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $113 million in the corresponding 2019 period and $133 million in the initial quarter of 2020. Contributing to the decline in such revenues in the recent quarter as compared with the prior quarters were the impact of reduced customer activity on

&#160;

merchant discount and credit card fees and loan syndication fees. Additionally, during the first 2020 quarter, M&#38;T received $23 million of income from BLG. There was no similar income in t he second quarters of 2020 or 2019. Included in other revenues from operations were the following significant components. Letter of credit and other credit-related fees aggregated $25 million in the recent quarter, compared with $29 million in the year-ear lier quarter and $32 million in the first quarter of 2020. Revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees were $23 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $31 million in the year-earlier quarter and $30 million in the initial 2020 quart er. Tax-exempt income from bank owned life insurance, which includes increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received, totaled $13 million in the recent quarter, compared with $14 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $12 million in the first quarter of 2020. Insurance-related sales commissions and other revenues totaled $10 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared with $12 million and $15 million in 2019&#8217;s second quarter and 2020&#8217;s first quarter, respec tively. M&#38;T&#8217;s investment in BLG resulted in income in the first quarter of 2020 of $23 million. As previously noted, there was no such income in the second quarters of 2020 or 2019. 

Other income totaled $1.02 billion during the first six months of 2020, up $4 million as compared with $1.01 billion in the year-earlier period. Higher mortgage banking revenues and trust income in 2020 were largely offset by decreases in service charges on deposit accounts, income from BLG and merchant discount and credit card fees, and unrealized losses on investment securities.

Mortgage banking revenues totaled $273 million during the first six months of 2020, compared with $203 million during the similar period in 2019. Residential mortgage banking revenues aggregated $210 million and $138 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. New commitments to originate residential real estate loans to be sold aggregated $2.1 billion and $1.1 billion in the initial six months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Realized gains from sales of residential real estate loans and loan servicing rights and recognized unrealized gains and losses on residential real estate loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans aggregated to gains of $84 million and $23 million in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenues from servicing residential real estate loans for others were $126 million in the first half of 2020 and $115 million in the corresponding 2019 period. Included in servicing revenues were sub-servicing revenues aggregating $71 million and $57 million in the first six months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, commercial mortgage banking revenues were $63 million and $65 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Commercial real estate loans originated for sale to other investors totaled $1.3 billion and $1.8 billion during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Service charges on deposit accounts aggregated $184 million during the first half of 2020, compared with $211 million in the year-earlier period. That decline was predominantly due to lower consumer service charges resulting from the impact of the pandemic, reflecting waived fees and lower debit card and other customer transaction activity. Trust income totaled $301 million and $277 million during the first six months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in trust income in 2020 as compared with 2019 was largely due to higher revenues from the ICS business, reflecting both sales activities and higher retirement services income from growth in collective fund balances. Brokerage services income totaled $24 million in the first half of 2020, compared with $25 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $29 million during each of the first six months of 2020 and 2019.

Net unrealized losses on investment securities totaling $14 million were recognized during the first six months of 2020, compared with net unrealized gains of $21 million in the corresponding 2019 period. 

&#160;

Other revenues from operations totaled $220 million in the first half of 2020, compared with $247 million in the year-earlier period. Other revenues from operations include the following significant components. Letter of credit and other credit-related fees aggregated $56 million and $53 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Income from bank owned life insurance totaled $25 million in the first six months of 2020, compared with $26 million in the corresponding 2019 period. Merchant discount and credit card fees were $52 million and $58 million in the first six months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Insurance-related commissions and other revenues aggregated $25 million and $26 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. M&#38;T&#8217;s investment in BLG resulted in income of $23 million in the first six months of 2020 and $37 million in the similar 2019 period.

Other Expense

Other expense totaled $807 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $873 million in the year-earlier quarter and $906 million in the first quarter of 2020. Included in those amounts are expenses considered to be &#8220;nonoperating&#8221; in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $4 million in each of the two most recent quarters and $5 million in the second quarter of 2019. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $803 million in the recent quarter, compared with $868 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $903 million in the initial 2020 quarter. The lower level of expenses in the recent quarter as compared with the second quarter of 2019 was largely attributable to a $48 million charge recorded in the 2019 period to reduce the carrying value of an investment in an asset manager that had been accounted for using the equity method of accounting to its estimated realizable value. The sale of that investment was completed in September 2019. Also contributing to the decreased expenses were lower costs for professional services, advertising and marketing, and travel and entertainment. The last two categories reflect reduced business activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The recent quarter&#8217;s decline in noninterest operating expenses as compared with the first quarter of 2020 was largely attributable to lower salaries and employee benefits expenses, reflecting seasonally higher stock-based compensation and employee benefits expenses in the initial 2020 quarter and reduced incentive compensation in 2020&#8217;s second quarter resulting from the pandemic-related slowdown in business activity, and decreases in advertising and marketing, and travel and entertainment costs. Table 2 provides a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense.

Other expense for the first half of 2020 totaled $1.71 billion, compared with $1.77 billion in the year-earlier period. Included in those amounts are expenses considered to be &#8220;nonoperating&#8221; in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $8 million and $10 million in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses for the first half of 2020 were $1.71 billion, compared with $1.76 billion in the first six months of 2019. The decline in noninterest operating expenses was largely attributable to the $48 million charge associated with the asset manager investment in 2019 and lower costs for legal-related and professional and outside services, partially offset by higher salaries and employee benefits expenses in the 2020 period.

Salaries and employee benefits expense totaled $459 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $456 million in the year-earlier quarter and $537 million in the first quarter of 2020. In comparing the second quarter of 2020 with that of 2019, higher expenses for salaries resulting from merit and other increases were offset by reduced incentive compensation costs. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense in the recent quarter as compared with the first quarter of 2020 was attributable to seasonally higher stock-based compensation, medical plan costs, payroll-related taxes, unemployment insurance and the Company&#8217;s contributions for retirement savings plan benefits related to annual incentive compensation payments in the first quarter of 2020, and decreased incentive compensation costs in the recent quarter. During the first six months of 2020 and 2019, salaries and employee benefits expense aggregated $996 million and $955 million, respectively. The higher expense level in 2020 largely reflects the impact of merit and other increases for employees and increased employee benefit costs, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs. The Company, in accordance with GAAP, has accelerated the recognition of compensation costs for stock-based awards granted to retirement-eligible employees and employees who will become retirement-eligible prior to full vesting of the award. As a result, stock-based compensation expense during the first quarter of 2020 included $31 million that would have been recognized over the normal vesting period if not for the accelerated recognition provisions of GAAP. That acceleration had no effect on the value of stock-based compensation awarded to employees. Salaries and employee benefits expense included stock-based compensation of $13 million and $12 million in the three-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively, $43 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, and $56 million and $53 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The number of full-time equivalent employees was 17,098 at June 30, 2020, compared with 17,516 and 17,416 at June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2020, respectively.

Excluding the nonoperating expense items described earlier from each quarter, nonpersonnel operating expenses were $344 million and $412 million in the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively, and $366 million in the initial quarter of 2020. On that same basis, such expenses were $710 million and $802 million in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decline in nonpersonnel expenses in the recent quarter 

- 79 -

&#160;

as compared with the second quarter of 2019 reflects lower co sts for professional services and advertising and marketing, and the $48 million charge related to the asset manager investment in the second quarter of 2019. The lower level of nonpersonnel operating expenses in the recent quarter as compared with the fir st 2020 quarter was predominantly attributable to decreased costs for advertising and marketing and travel and entertainment. The decline in nonpersonnel operating expenses in the first six months of 2020 as compared with the similar 2019 period reflected the 2019 asset manager investment charge of $48 million and reduced costs for legal-related and professional services, advertising and marketing, and travel and entertainment. 

The efficiency ratio measures the relationship of noninterest operating expenses to revenues. The Company&#8217;s efficiency ratio was 55.7% during the recent quarter, compared with 56.0% and 58.9% in the second quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020, respectively. The efficiency ratios for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 were 57.4% and 56.8%, respectively. The calculation of the efficiency ratio is presented in Table 2.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $71 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $152 million in the year-earlier quarter and $81 million in the initial 2020 quarter. For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the provisions for income taxes were $152 million and $304 million, respectively. The effective tax rates were 22.8%, 24.3% and 23.1% for the quarters ended June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2020, respectively, and 23.0% and 24.1% for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The effective tax rate is affected by the level of income earned that is exempt from tax relative to the overall level of pre-tax income, the level of income allocated to the various state and local jurisdictions where the Company operates, because tax rates differ among such jurisdictions, and the impact of any large discrete or infrequently occurring items. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate in future periods will also be affected by any change in income tax laws or regulations and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the Company&#8217;s interpretations by any of various tax authorities that may examine tax returns filed by M&#38;T or any of its subsidiaries.

Capital

Shareholders&#8217; equity was $15.9 billion at June 30, 2020, representing 11.43% of total assets, compared with $15.7 billion or 12.91% a year earlier and $15.7 billion or 13.11% at December 31, 2019.

Included in shareholders&#8217; equity was preferred stock with financial statement carrying values of $1.25 billion at each of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, compared with $1.23 billion at June 30, 2019. 

Common shareholders&#8217; equity was $14.7 billion, or $114.54 per share, at June 30, 2020, compared with $14.5 billion, or $107.73 per share, a year earlier and $14.5 billion, or $110.78 per share, at December 31, 2019. Tangible equity per common share, which excludes goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets and applicable deferred tax balances, was $78.62 at the end of the recent quarter, compared with $73.29 at June 30, 2019 and $75.44 at December 31, 2019. The Company&#8217;s ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets was 7.48% at June 30, 2020, compared with 8.41% a year earlier and 8.55% at December 31, 2019. Reconciliations of total common shareholders&#8217; equity and tangible common equity and total assets and tangible assets as of each of those respective dates are presented in table 2.

Shareholders&#8217; equity reflects accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which includes the net after-tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale, remaining unrealized losses on held-to-maturity securities transferred from available for sale that have not yet been amortized, gains or losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments and adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Net unrealized gains on investment securities reflected in shareholders&#8217; equity, net of applicable tax effect, were $170 million, or $1.32 per common share, at June 30, 2020, $7 million, or $.05 per common share, at June 30, 2019 and $37 million, or $.29 per common share, at December 31, 2019. Changes in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities are predominantly reflective of the impact of changes in interest rates on the values of such securities. 

- 80 -

&#160;

Information about unrealized gains and losses as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 is included in note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

Reflected in the carrying amount of available-for-sale investment securities at June 30, 2020 were pre-tax effect unrealized gains of $253 million on securities with an amortized cost of $5.4 billion and pre-tax effect unrealized losses of $16 million on securities with an amortized cost of $176 million. Information concerning the Company&#8217;s fair valuations of investment securities is provided in notes 2 and 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Each reporting period the Company reviews its available-for-sale investment securities for declines in value that might be indicative of credit-related losses through an analysis of the creditworthiness of the issuer or the credit performance of the underlying collateral supporting the bond. If the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a debt security a credit loss is recognized and such loss would be recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Beginning January 1, 2020, an allowance for credit losses would reduce the carrying value of available-for-sale investment securities. Previously if a credit-related loss was deemed to have occurred, the investment security&#8217;s cost basis was adjusted , as appropriate for the circumstances. A loss is also recognized in the consolidated statement of income if the Company intends to sell a bond or it more likely than not will be required to sell a bond before recovery of the amortized cost basis. 

As of June 30, 2020, based on a review of each of the securities in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio, the Company concluded that it expected to realize the amortized cost basis of each security. As of June 30, 2020, the Company did not intend to sell nor is it anticipated that it would be required to sell any securities for which fair value was less than the amortized cost basis of the security. The Company intends to continue to closely monitor the performance of its securities because changes in their underlying credit performance or other events could cause the amortized cost basis of those securities to become uncollectible. 

On January 1, 2020 the Company adopted amended accounting guidance that requires investment securities held to maturity to be presented at their net carrying value that is expected to be collected over their contractual term. The Company estimated no material allowance for credit losses for its investment securities classified as held-to-maturity at January 1, 2020, March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 as the substantial majority of such investment securities were obligations backed by the U.S. government or its agencies. The Company assessed the potential for expected credit losses on privately issued mortgage-backed securities in the held-to-maturity portfolio by performing internal modeling to estimate bond-specific cash flows considering recent performance of the mortgage loan collateral and utilizing assumptions about future defaults and loss severity. These bond-specific cash flows also reflect the placement of the bond in the overall securitization structure and the remaining subordination levels. In total, at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had in its held-to-maturity portfolio privately issued mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost basis of $86 million and $93 million, respectively, and a fair value of $76 million and $87 million, respectively. At June 30, 2020, 82% of the mortgage-backed securities were in the most senior tranche of the securitization structure with 17% being independently rated as investment grade. The mortgage-backed securities are generally collateralized by residential and small-balance commercial real estate loans originated between 2004 and 2008 and had a weighted-average credit enhancement of 9% at June 30, 2020, calculated by dividing the remaining unpaid principal balance of bonds subordinate to the bonds owned by the Company plus any overcollateralization remaining in the securitization structure by the remaining unpaid principal balance of all bonds in the securitization structure. The weighted-average default percentage and loss severity assumptions utilized in the Company&#8217;s internal modeling were 34% and 69% respectively. Given the securitization structure, some of the bonds held by the Company may defer interest payments in certain circumstances, but after considering the repayment structure and estimated future collateral cash flows of each individual senior and subordinate tranche bond, the Company has concluded that as of June 30, 2020, it expected to recover the amortized cost basis of those privately issued mortgage-backed securities. Nevertheless, it is possible that adverse changes in the estimated future performance of mortgage loan collateral underlying such securities could impact the Company&#8217;s conclusions.

Adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, net of applicable tax effect, reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by $324 million, or $2.53 per common share, at June 30, 2020, $255 million, or $1.90 per common share, at June 30, 2019 and $342 million, or $2.62 per common share, at December 31, 2019.

Pursuant to previously approved capital plans and authorizations by M&#38;T&#8217;s Board of Directors, M&#38;T repurchased 2,577,000 shares of its common stock for $374 million in the first quarter of 2020. There were no repurchases of common stock during the quarter-ended June 30, 2020. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic impact on overall economic conditions and consistent with regulatory guidance, M&#38;T has ceased repurchasing its common stock for the time being and does not anticipate repurchasing any shares during the third quarter of 2020. M&#38;T repurchased 2,450,000 shares of its common stock for $402 million in the second quarter of 2019 and 4,600,000 shares for $768 million during the first half of 2019. 

Cash dividends declared on M&#38;T&#8217;s common stock totaled $142 million in the recent quarter, compared with $135 million and $143 million during the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2020, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2019, M&#38;T&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $1.10 per common share from the previous rate of $1.00 per common share. Cash dividends declared on preferred stock aggregated $17 million in each of the first two quarters of 2020, compared with $18 million in the second quarter of 2019.

M&#38;T and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal banking agencies. Pursuant to those regulations, the minimum capital ratios are as follows:

&#160;

&#8226; 

4.5% Common Equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) to risk-weighted assets (each as defined in the capital regulations)&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets (each as defined in the capital regulations)&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets (each as defined in the capital regulations)&#59; and 

&#160;

&#8226; 

4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the &#8220;leverage ratio&#8221;), as defined in the capital regulations. 

In addition, capital regulations require a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; of 2.5% composed entirely of CET1 on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. 

The federal bank regulatory agencies have issued rules that allow banks and bank holding companies to phase -in the impact of adopting the expected credit loss accounting model on regulatory capital. Those rules allow banks and bank holding companies to delay for two years the day one impact on retained earnings of adopting the expected loss accounting standard and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses subsequent to the initial adoption, followed by a three year transition period. M&#38;T and its subsidiary banks have elected to adopt these rules and the impact is reflected in the regulatory capital ratios presented below.

The regulatory capital ratios of the Company and its bank subsidiaries, M&#38;T Bank and Wilmington Trust, N.A., as of June 30, 2020 are presented in the accompanying table.

The Company is subject to the comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to bank and financial holding companies and their subsidiaries, which includes examinations by a number of regulators. Regulation of financial institutions such as M&#38;T and its subsidiaries is intended prim arily for the protection of depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC and the banking and financial system as a whole, and generally is not intended for the protection of shareholders, investors or creditors other than insured depositors. Changes in laws, regulations and regulatory policies applicable to the Company&#8217;s operations can increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive environment in which the Company operates, all of whic h could have a material effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and in M&#38;T&#8217;s ability to pay dividends. For additional information concerning this comprehensive regulatory framework, refer to Part I, Item 1 of M&#38;T &#8217;s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Segment Information

The Company's reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Financial information about the Company's segments is presented in note 13 of Notes to Financial Statements. The reportable segments are Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking. 

The Business Banking segment earned net income of $38 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $42 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $33 million in the first quarter of 2020. As compared with the year-earlier quarter, the 11% recent quarter decline reflected a $4 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts, a $3 million increase in centrally-allocated costs associated with data processing, risk management and other support services provided to the Business Banking segment, and higher personnel-related costs of $2 million, partially offset by a $4 million increase in net interest income. The improvement in net interest income reflected higher average outstanding deposit and loan balances of $3.4 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, partially offset by a narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits and loans of 76 and 54 basis points, respectively. The increase in average loan balances reflects PPP loans originated in 2020&#8217;s second quarter. The recent quarter&#8217;s 14% increase in net income as compared with the first quarter of 2020 was largely due to an $8 million increase in net interest income and a $4 million decrease in the provision for credit losses (due to lower net charge-offs), partially offset by declines of $4 million in service charges on deposit accounts and $2 million in merchant and credit card fee income, each reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that has resulted in waived fees and reduced transaction activity. The improvement in net interest income reflected higher average outstanding deposit and loan balances of $3.2 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, partially offset by a narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits and loans of 42 and 68 basis points, respectively. Net income recorded by the Business Banking segment totaled $70 million in the first six months of 2020, compared with $86 million in the year-earlier period. That 18% year-over-year decrease was predominantly driven by a $9 million increase in the provision for credit losses, due to higher net charge-offs, higher personnel-related costs of $5 million and a $3 million decline in service charges on deposit accounts.

&#160;

The Commercial Banking segment recorded net income of $111 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2020, down from $124 million in the year-earlier quarter and $144 million in the first quarter of 2020. The 10% decrease as compared with the second quarter of 2019 reflected an increase of $27 million in the provision for credit losses, due to higher net charge-offs, a $9 million write-down of equipment under operating leases and lower merchant discount and credit card fees and advisory fees of $4 million and $3 million, respectively. Those unfavorable factors were offset, in part, by higher net interest income of $23 million, reflecting increased average outstanding deposit and loan balances of $7.2 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, partially offset by a narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits and loans of 65 and 14 basis points, respectively. The increased loan balances largely reflect PPP loans funded during the recent quarter, The decrease in the recent quarter&#8217;s net income as compared with the immediately preceding quarter resulted from a $40 million increase in the provision for credit losses, due to higher net charge-offs, a $9 million write-down of operating lease equipment, a $7 million decrease in letter of credit and credit-related fees, predominantly due to lower loan syndication fees, and a $5 million decline in merchant discount and credit card fees. Partially offsetting those declines were higher net interest income of $16 million, reflecting a $5.9 billion increase in average outstanding deposit balances partially offset by a 38 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits, and a $6 million reduction in salaries and employee benefits expense. Net income earned by the Commercial Banking segment totaled 

- 83 -

&#160;

$255 million for the first half of 2020, little changed from $256 million earned in the similar 2019 period. A higher provision for cr edit losses of $35 million, due to higher net charge-offs, was offset by a $30 million increase in net interest income, predominantly due to increases in average outstanding deposit and loan balances of $4.1 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, partial ly offset by a 29 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits, and a $7 million rise in letter of credit and credit-related fees, largely due to higher loan syndication fees. 

The Commercial Real Estate segment recorded net income of $107 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $122 million in the year-earlier period and $117 million in the initial 2020 quarter. Contributing to the 12% decline in the recent quarter&#8217;s net income as compared with the year-earlier quarter was a $21 million increase in the provision for credit losses, largely due to higher net charge-offs, partially offset by a $7 million increase in net interest income, chiefly due to a $1.8 billion increase in average outstanding loan balances, partially offset by a 64 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits. The recent quarter decline in net income as compared with the initial 2020 quarter reflects a $20 million increase in the provision for credit losses and a $7 million decline in trading account and foreign exchange gains (reflecting reduced customer interest rate swap agreement activity). Partially offsetting those unfavorable factors were a $9 million increase in net interest income, predominantly due to a $974 million increase in average outstanding loan balances, a $4 million increase in mortgage banking revenues, and a $3 million decline in salaries and employee benefits. Net income for the Commercial Real Estate segment totaled $224 million and $239 million during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A $22 million increase in the provision for credit losses, mainly due to higher net charge-offs, was offset, in part, by higher trading account and foreign exchange gains of $5 million resulting from increased activity associated with interest rate swap agreements executed on behalf of commercial customers and a $3 million increase in net interest income, due primarily to an increase in average outstanding loan balances of $1.4 billion, partially offset by a 27 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits.

&#160;

The Discretionary Portfolio segment contributed net income of $96 million during the three-month period ended June 30, 2020, up from $38 million in the year-earlier period and $26 million in the first quarter of 2020. The recent quarter improvement as compared with the second quarter of 2019 was largely driven by a $86 million increase in net interest income. This favorable factor was partially offset by a $3 million decrease in trading account and foreign exchange gains and a $2 million decline in valuation gains associated with marketable equity securities. The improvement in the recent quarter&#8217;s net income as compared with the first quarter of 2020 was primarily due to a $60 million increase in net interest income and higher valuations of marketable equity securities of $27 million. Year-to-date net income for this segment totaled $121 million in 2020 and $77 million in 2019. Contributing to the year-over-year improvement was a $105 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by valuation losses associated with marketable equity securities (compared with gains in the 2019 period) representing a change of $35 million. The increases in net interest income reflect additional income from interest rate swap agreements utilized as part of the Company&#8217;s management of interest rate risk.

&#160;

Net income from the Residential Mortgage Banking segment was $37 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2020, up from $8 million in the year-earlier quarter and $25 million in the first quarter of 2020. The increase in the recent quarter as compared with the second 2019 quarter was driven by higher revenues associated with mortgage origination and sales activities (including intersegment revenues) of $43 million, partially offset by higher personnel-related costs of $4 million. The increase in the recent quarter&#8217;s net income as compared with the immediately preceding quarter was due to higher revenues from mortgage origination and sales activities of $20 million, partially offset by a decrease of $8 million in servicing revenues (including intersegment revenues). The Residential Mortgage Banking segment had net income of $62 million in the first six months of 2020, up from $21 million in the corresponding 2019 period. That improvement reflected higher revenues from mortgage origination and sales activities (including intersegment revenues) of $70 million from the year-earlier period resulting from increased loan commitment volumes and improved margins, as well as a $9 million increase in servicing revenues (including intersegment revenues). Those favorable factors were offset, in part, by higher additions to the valuation allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights of $11 million and increased salaries and employee benefits expense of $8 million.

&#160;

Net income earned by the Retail Banking segment totaled $86 million in the second quarter of 2020, down from $140 million in the year-earlier quarter and $110 million in the initial 2020 quarter. The decline i n the recently completed quarter as compared with the second quarter of 2019 was primarily driven by a $50 million decrease in net interest income, predominately due to the impact of a narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits of 71 basis points, pa rtially offset by higher average outstanding deposit and loan balances of $2.0 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Also contributing to the lower net income was a $25 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts, reflective of fee waivers an d lower customer transaction activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 22% decrease in net income in the second quarter of 2020 as compared with the initial 2020 quarter reflected a $24 million decline in net interest income, mainly driven by a 35 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits, and a $22 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts offset, in part, by a lower provision for credit losses of $9 million, mainly due to lower net charge-offs, and decreased cent rally-allocated expenses associated with data processing, risk management and other support services provided to the Retail Banking segment of $4 million. Net income recorded by the Retail Banking segment totaled $197 million in the first half of 2020 and $286 million in the similar period of 2019. Factors contributing to that 31% year-over-year decline were lower net interest income of $75 million, reflecting a narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits of 29 basis points partially offset by a $1.5 b illion increase in average outstanding loan balances, a $24 million decline in service charges on deposit accounts, and higher personnel-related costs of $12 million. 

The &#8220;All Other&#8221; category reflects other activities of the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments. Reflected in this category are the amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of financial institutions, distributed income from BLG, merger-related expenses resulting from acquisitions (when incurred) and the net impact of the Company&#8217;s allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with the earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company&#8217;s reportable segments and the provision for credit losses. The &#8220;All Other&#8221; category also includes trust income of the Company that reflects the ICS and WAS business activities. The various components of the &#8220;All Other&#8221; category resulted in net losses totaling $234 million, $302,000, and $186 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, respectively. As compared with the year-earlier quarter, the higher recent quarter net loss reflected an increase to the provision for credit losses of $226 million and the unfavorable impact from the Company&#8217;s allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company&#8217;s reportable segments. Those unfavorable factors were partially offset by a $73 million decrease in professional services expenses, an $8 million increase in trust income and a $7 million decline in advertising and marketing expenses. The decline in the recent quarter as compared with the first quarter of 2020 was primarily due to an increase to the provision for credit losses of $32 million, $23 million of income from BLG received in the first quarter of 2020, and the unfavorable impact from the Company's allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company's reportable segments. Those unfavorable factors were partially offset by decreases in salaries and employee benefits expenses of $75 million and in advertising and marketing expenses of $10 million. The &#8220;All Other&#8221; category had a net loss of $420 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, compared with net loss of $8 million in the corresponding period of 2019. The unfavorable performance in 2020 as compared with 2019 was predominantly driven by: an increase in the provision for credit losses of $430 million, increased salaries and benefits of $19 million, a $13 million increase in outside data processing and software expense, and the unfavorable impact from the Company's allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company's reportable segments. Partially offsetting those unfavorable factors were: a $48 million charge in 2019 associated with the reduction of the carrying value of an investment in an asset manager, lower professional services costs of $39 million and higher trust income of $23 million.

Forward-Looking Statements

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other sections of this quarterly report contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company&#8217;s business, management&#8217;s beliefs and assumptions made by management. Any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement, including statements regarding the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;continue,&#8221; &#8220;positions,&#8221; &#8220;prospects&#8221; or &#8220;potential,&#8221; by future conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; or &#8220;may,&#8221; or by variations of such words or by similar expressions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (&#8220;Future Factors&#8221;) which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the Company assumes no duty to update forward-looking statements. 

Future Factors include changes in interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity&#59; prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit losses and market values on loans, collateral securing loans, and other assets&#59; sources of liquidity&#59; common shares outstanding&#59; common stock price volatility&#59; fair value of and number of stock-based compensation awards to be issued in future periods&#59; risks and uncertainties relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic&#59; the impact of changes in market values on trust-related revenues&#59; legislation and/or regulation affecting the financial services industry as a whole, and M&#38;T and its subsidiaries individually or collectively, including tax legislation or regulation&#59; regulatory supervision and oversight, including monetary policy and capital requirements&#59; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, regulatory agencies or legislation&#59; increasing price and product/service competition by competitors, including new entrants&#59; rapid technological developments and changes&#59; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis&#59; the mix of products/services&#59; containing costs and expenses&#59; governmental and public policy changes&#59; protection and validity of intellectual property rights&#59; reliance on large customers&#59; technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large, multi-year contracts&#59; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings, including tax-related examinations and other matters&#59; continued availability of financing&#59; financial resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support M&#38;T and its subsidiaries' future businesses&#59; and material differences in the actual financial results of merger, acquisition and investment activities compared with M&#38;T's initial expectations, including the full realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements. 

These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, general economic and political conditions, either nationally or in the states in which M&#38;T and its subsidiaries do business, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes and trends in the securities markets, and other Future Factors.

Further, statements about the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that the actual effects may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond the Company&#8217;s control, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on customers, clients, third parties and the Company.
