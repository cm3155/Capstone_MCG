Financial results during 2020 and 2021 were adversely impacted by the effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) pandemic. Large portions of the U.S. economy were severely impacted throughout much of those two years and as a result, many commercial and consumer customers were negatively affected. The effects of the pandemic resulted in the Company recognizing an elevated provision for credit losses during 2020 that reflected projections of credit losses based on macroeconomic forecasts that were based on then existing economic conditions. As a result, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $800 million in 2020. Improvements in economic conditions and forecasts throughout 2021 led the Company to recognize a provision recapture of $75 million in that year. In response to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve took actions to lower interest rates that have negatively affected the Company&#8217;s net interest income since the beginning of the pandemic.

On March 27, 2020 the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (&#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) was signed into law. In addition to providing financial assistance to both businesses and consumers, the CARES Act created a forbearance program for federally-backed mortgage loans, protected borrowers from negative credit reporting due to loan accommodations resulting from the pandemic, and provided financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings to account for the effects of COVID-19. The bank regulatory agencies likewise issued guidance encouraging financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers that were unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of COVID-19. That guidance, with concurrence of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and provisions of the CARES Act allowed modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were generally current with their payments prior to any relief, to not be treated as troubled debt restructurings nor be reported as past due.

The CARES Act also provided funding opportunities for small businesses under the Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) from approved Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) lenders, including M&#38;T Bank. For commercial and consumer customers, the Company provided a host of relief options, such as payment deferrals (including maturity extensions), loan covenant waivers and low interest rate loan products. M&#38;T Bank funded approximately $7.0 billion of PPP loans during 2020 and another $2.9 billion in 2021, of which $1.2 billion remained outstanding at December 31, 2021. 

The national effort to mitigate the pandemic has resulted in a challenging environment for businesses and their employees. The Company has taken actions designed to help provide a safe environment for its customers and employees and to provide relief to customers in a variety of ways. Examples of those actions include:

&#8226; The deployment of a Pandemic Response Plan to manage the pandemic&#8217;s effects on operations, employees and customers, including seeking to ensure employee safety, maintaining continuity of operations and service levels for customers, preserving the Company&#8217;s financial strength, and complying with applicable laws and regulations. Actions have included placing restrictions on travel, implementing social distancing, health screening, sanitation and other protocols, and mandating for all employees whose jobs can be performed remotely to work from home where possible. In accordance with changes in Federal guidelines (e.g. the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and state and local regulations, the Company has begun to roll back certain of these measures&#59;

&#8226; The vast majority of the Company&#8217;s non-branch employees continued to work remotely during 2021&#59; the Company is preparing to employ an operating model consisting of onsite, hybrid and fully remote employee work schedules when COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations stabilize&#59; 

&#8226; M&#38;T Bank branches remain open, with open lobbies and normal access to drive-through windows and ATMs&#59; and

&#8226; Some loan customers are still receiving COVID-19 related relief in various forms, including modification and forbearance requests as of December 31, 2021 as described herein and in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.

On February 22, 2021 M&#38;T announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with People&#8217;s United Financial, Inc. (&#8220;People&#8217;s United&#8221;) under which People&#8217;s United will be acquired by M&#38;T in an all-stock transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, People&#8217;s United shareholders will receive consideration valued at .118 of an M&#38;T share in the form of M&#38;T common stock. People&#8217;s United outstanding preferred stock will be converted to a new series of M&#38;T preferred stock upon completion of the acquisition. The transaction is valued at approximately $7.8 billion (with the price based on M&#38;T&#8217;s closing price of $153.58 per share as of December 31, 2021).

As of December 31, 2021, People&#8217;s United reported $64.6 billion of assets, including $37.9 billion of loans and $10.8 billion of investment securities, $56.7 billion of liabilities, including $53.8 billion of deposits, and $7.9 billion of stockholders&#8217; equity. The merger has been approved by the common shareholders of M&#38;T and People&#8217;s United, the New York State Department of Financial Services and Connecticut Department of Banking but remains subject to approval by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The merger is expected to be completed promptly after the parties have obtained approval and satisfied other customary closing conditions.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies conform with generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized. Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the Company&#8217;s reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances. The more significant areas in which management of the Company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following:

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Accounting for credit losses &#8212; Effective January 1, 2020 the Company adopted amended accounting guidance that impacts how the allowance for credit losses is determined. Under the new accounting guidance, the allowance for credit losses represents a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of certain financial assets, including loans and leases, to present the net amount expected to be collected at the balance sheet date. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. In estimating expected losses in the loan and lease portfolio, borrower-specific financial data and macro-economic assumptions are utilized to project losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. For certain loan pools that share similar risk characteristics, the Company utilizes statistically developed models to estimate amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers&#8217; abilities to repay obligations. Such models consider historical correlations of credit losses with various macroeconomic assumptions including unemployment, gross domestic product and real estate prices. These forecasts may be adjusted for inherent limitations or biases of the models. Subsequent to the forecast period, the Company utilizes longer-term historical loss experience to estimate 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

losses over the remaining contractual life of the loans. Prior to 2020, the allowance for credit losses represented the amount that in management&#8217;s judgment reflected incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The estimation of the allowance for credit losses prior to 2020 did not consider reasonable and supportable forecasts that could have affected the collectability of the reported amounts. Changes in the circumstances considered when determining management&#8217;s estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions, which could result in adjustment of the allowance for credit losses in future periods. A discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in determining the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the heading &#8220;Provision for Credit Losses&#8221; and in note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Valuation methodologies &#8212; Management of the Company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include loans, deposits, borrowings, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations, capitalized servicing assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, estimated residual values of property associated with leases, and certain derivative and other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Company&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition or disclosures of fair value information. In addition to valuation, the Company must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that require recognition of a loss in the consolidated statement of income. Examples include certain investments, capitalized servicing assets, goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, among others. Specific assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in management&#8217;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 13, 19, 20 and 21 of Notes to Financial Statements.

&#8226; 

Commitments, contingencies and off-balance sheet arrangements &#8212; Information regarding the Company&#8217;s commitments and contingencies, including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation, and their potential effects on the Company&#8217;s results of operations is included in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management&#8217;s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations. Information regarding the Company&#8217;s income taxes is presented in note 14 of Notes to Financial Statements. The recognition or de-recognition in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements of assets and liabilities held by so-called variable interest entities is subject to the interpretation and application of complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that require management to estimate and assess the relative significance of the Company&#8217;s financial interests in those entities and

the degree to which the Company can influence the most important activities of the entities. Information relating to the Company&#8217;s involvement in such entities and the accounting treatment afforded each such involvement is included in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Interest income data are on a taxable-equivalent basis. The taxable-equivalent adjustment represents additional income taxes that would be due if all interest income were subject to income taxes. This adjustment, which is related to interest received on qualified municipal securities, industrial revenue financings and preferred equity securities, is based on a composite income tax rate of approximately 26% in 2018-2021 and 39% in prior years.

Financial results for 2021 and 2020 were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Large portions of the U.S. economy were substantially curtailed for extended periods of time and, as a result, many commercial and consumer customers were adversely impacted. Specifically, those 

adverse economic impacts, coupled with an accounting change noted herein, resulted in the Company recognizing significantly higher provisions for credit losses during 2020 as compared with previous years. An improvement in economic conditions during 2021 led the Company to recapture provision for credit losses of $75 million in 2021 compared with provisions for credit losses of $800 million in 2020 and $176 million in 2019. The 2020 and 2021 periods reflect the amended accounting guidance for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial instruments. Prior to 2020, the provision for credit losses reflected incurred losses only. In response to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve took actions to lower interest rates that have negatively affected the Company&#8217;s net interest income since the beginning of the pandemic. Taxable-equivalent net interest income totaled $3.84 billion, $3.88 billion and $4.15 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Economic forecasts improved in 2021 resulting in a recapture of provision for credit losses in 2021 compared with significant provision for credit losses recorded in the prior year. During 2020, economic forecasts utilized during each interim period resulted in higher estimates of expected credit losses in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio than at January 1, 2020, resulting in higher levels of the provision for credit losses in each of those quarters as compared with the comparable 2019 periods. Specifically, the level of the provision in 2020 reflected the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on economic activity in the hospitality and retail sectors, the uncertainty at December 31, 2020 as to the sufficiency and effectiveness of economic stimulus provided by the U.S. government to the economy, and concerns about ultimate collectability of real estate loans where the borrowers requested re-payment forbearance. Concerns remain about large sectors of the economy, including the hotel, healthcare and office space sectors. The allowance for credit losses for commercial real estate loans remains elevated as a result. The Company expects that it will likely continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic after December 31, 2021. Specifically, the Company expects that the following balance sheet and income statement categories could be affected:

&#8226; Net interest income and net interest margin &#8211; the low interest rate environment will continue to negatively affect the Company&#8217;s net interest margin until the level of general interest rates rises&#59;

&#8226; Provision for credit losses &#8211; although the economy has experienced a recovery in 2021, it is possible that economic assumptions used to calculate the allowance for credit losses at the end of future reporting periods could deteriorate, resulting in higher levels of the provision and allowance for credit losses. In addition, the impact on borrowers&#8217; ability to repay loans could be negatively affected, potentially leading to increased charge-offs&#59;

&#8226; A resurgence of the pandemic or emergence of COVID-19 variants in large parts of the country may impact customer demand for many of the Company&#8217;s products and services, in particular credit and deposit-related products and services.

Effective January 1, 2020, M&#38;T adopted amended accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. That guidance required an allowance for credit losses to be deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net carrying value that is expected to be collected over the contractual term of the assets considering relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The accounting guidance replaced the previous incurred loss model for determining the allowance for credit losses. The adoption of the amended guidance resulted in a $132 million increase in the allowance for credit losses as of January 1, 2020. Additional information on the amended accounting guidance is provided under the heading &#8220;Provision for Credit Losses&#8221; and in note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements.

There were several notable matters during 2019 that impacted that year&#8217;s results. In the first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized an expense of $50 million (reflected in &#8220;other costs of operations&#8221;) to increase its reserve for legal matters associated with a subsidiary&#8217;s role as trustee of Employee Stock Ownership Plans in its Institutional Client Services business. That expense, on an after-tax basis, reduced net income by $37 million, or $.27 of diluted earnings per common share. In 

July 2019, M&#38;T agreed to sell its non-controlling interest in an asset manager obtained in the 2011 acquisition of Wilmington Trust Corporation that had been accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, as a result, as of June 30, 2019 recorded a $48 million charge (reflected in &#8220;other costs of operations&#8221;) to reduce the carrying value of the investment to its estimated net realizable value. Similar to other active investment managers, the investee entity had experienced a decrease in assets under management and during the second quarter of 2019 the entity&#8217;s chief executive and investment officer announced his retirement. Following that announcement, successor management submitted a proposal to M&#38;T to restructure the organization of the entity. The after-tax impact of the charge was a reduction in net income of $36 million, or $.27 of diluted earnings per common share. The sale of M&#38;T&#8217;s interest in the asset manager was effective September 30, 2019. 

Reflecting the matters discussed previously, taxable-equivalent net interest income was $3.84 billion in 2021, compared with $3.88 billion in 2020. That decline resulted from a 40 basis point (hundredths of one percent) narrowing of the net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets, to 2.76% in 2021 from 3.16% in 2020, partially offset by the impact of an increase in average earning assets to $139.1 billion in 2021 from $122.9 billion in 2020. The increase in average earning assets resulted from higher amounts of low-yielding balances maintained by the Company at the Federal Reserve Bank (&#8220;FRB&#8221;) of New York. Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased 6% in 2020 from $4.15 billion in 2019. That decrease resulted from a 68 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin from 3.84% in 2019, partially offset by the impact of an increase in average earning assets from $108.2 billion in 2019 that reflected higher balances of loans and amounts held at the FRB of New York.

The provision for credit losses declined significantly in 2021 resulting in a recapture of previously recorded provisions of $75 million, compared with a &#160; provision for credit losses of $800 million recorded in 2020. The provision in 2019 was $176 million. Net charge-offs in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $192 million, $247 million and $144 million, respectively. 

Other income totaled $2.17 billion in 2021, $2.09 billion in 2020 and $2.06 billion in 2019. As compared with 2020, higher amounts of trust income, service charges on deposit accounts, and brokerage services income in 2021 were partially offset by lower trading account and foreign exchange gains, a higher loss on bank investment securities and less in distributions from Bayview Lending Group LLC (&#8220;BLG&#8221;). Comparing 2020 with 2019, a 24% rise in mortgage banking revenues, higher trust income and increased income from BLG were partially offset by a declines in service charges on deposit accounts, trading account and foreign exchange gains and loan syndication fees.

Other expense totaled $3.61 billion in 2021, compared with $3.39 billion in 2020 and &#160; $3.47 billion in 2019. Included in those amounts are expenses considered by M&#38;T to be &#8220;nonoperating&#8221; in nature, consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $10 million, $15 million and $19 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and merger-related expenses of $44 million in 2021. No merger-related expenses were recorded in 2020 and 2019. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses totaled $3.56 billion in 2021, compared with $3.37 billion in 2020 and $3.45 billion in 2019. The higher level of such expenses in 2021 as compared with 2020 was due to increased costs for salaries and employee benefits, outside data processing and software, FDIC assessments, and professional services. Contributing to the lower level of noninterest operating expenses in 2020 as compared with 2019 were decreased costs for professional services, legal-related matters, advertising and marketing, travel and entertainment, and a $48 million charge in the second quarter of 2019 associated with the sale of an equity investment in an asset manager. Those factors were partially offset by higher costs for salaries and employee benefits, outside data processing and software, increases to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights and $14 million of expenses related to the planned transition of 

the support for the Company&#8217;s retail brokerage and advisory business to the platform of LPL Financial. 

The efficiency ratio measures the relationship of noninterest operating expenses to revenues. The Company&#8217;s efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses (as previously defined) divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), was 59.0% in 2021, compared with 56.3% and 55.7% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The calculations of the efficiency ratio are presented in table 2.

The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate was 24.3% in 2021 and 2019, compared with 23.5% in 2020.

Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations

As a result of business combinations and other acquisitions, the Company had intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets totaling $4.6 billion at each of December 31, 2021 and 2020, consisting predominantly of goodwill. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after-tax effect, totaled $8 million, $11 million and $14 million during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

M&#38;T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a &#8220;net operating&#8221; or &#8220;tangible&#8221; basis, from which M&#38;T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and gains (when realized) and expenses (when incurred) associated with merging acquired or to be acquired operations with and into the Company, since such items are considered by management to be &#8220;nonoperating&#8221; in nature. In 2021, those merger-related expenses generally consisted of professional services, reflecting legal expenses and technology-related efforts to prepare for the integration of People&#8217;s United&#8217;s systems with those of the Company, and printing costs associated with the production of the joint proxy statement/prospectus distributed to the shareholders of M&#38;T and People&#8217;s United. Such expenses totaled $44 million ($34 million after-tax) in 2021. There were no merger-related gains or expenses in 2020 and 2019. Although &#8220;net operating income&#8221; as defined by M&#38;T is not a GAAP measure, M&#38;T&#8217;s management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results.

Net operating income was $1.90 billion in 2021, $1.36 million in 2020, and $1.94 billion in 2019. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $14.11 in 2021, $10.02 in 2020 and $13.86 in 2019.

Net operating income expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets was 1.28% in 2021, compared with 1.04% in 2020 and 1.69% in 2019. Net operating income represented a return on average tangible common equity of 16.80% in 2021, compared with 12.79% in 2020 and 19.08% in 2019.

Reconciliations of GAAP amounts with corresponding non-GAAP amounts are presented in table 2.

Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities

Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $3.84 billion in 2021, compared with $3.88 billion in 2020. The decrease in 2021 was primarily attributable to a 40 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin to 2.76% in 2021 from 3.16% in 2020 reflecting lower yields on loans offset, in part, by lower rates paid on deposits, and reduced balances of investment securities. Those net impacts were partially offset by increased deposits held at the FRB of New York that serve to increase net interest income, but, due to their low yield, reduce the reported net interest margin. 

Average earnings assets were $139.1 billion and $122.9 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Average loans and leases were $96.6 billion in both 2021 and 2020. Average balances of commercial loans and leases decreased $2.3 billion or 8% to $25.2 billion in 2021 from $27.5 billion in 2020. That decrease was largely the result of a decline in average balances of PPP loans due to loan forgiveness by the SBA, lower dealer floor plan balances reflecting automobile production and inventory issues experienced by the industry and subdued loan demand by commercial customers, in general. PPP loans averaged $4.1 billion in 2021 compared with $4.4 billion in 2020. Average commercial real estate loan balances were up $336 million or 1% to $37.3 billion in 2021 from $37.0 billion in 2020. Consumer loans averaged $17.3 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.4 billion or 9% from $15.9 billion in 2020, due to growth in recreational finance loans (consisting predominantly of loans secured by recreational vehicles and boats) and, to a lesser extent, automobile loans that was partially offset by declines in average outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit. Average residential real estate loans were $16.8 billion and $16.2 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively, reflecting repurchases of government-guaranteed loans from Ginnie Mae pools that are serviced by the Company. The Company repurchases government-guaranteed loans to reduce associated servicing costs, namely a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors, including payments deferred under COVID-19 forbearance arrangements. The loans repurchased from Ginnie Mae pools averaged $3.3 billion in 2021, up from $2.6 billion in 2020. Additionally, late in the third quarter of 2021 the Company began to retain recently originated residential mortgage loans in portfolio rather than sell such loans. These increases were offset by the ongoing repayments of loans by customers. 

Net interest income expressed on a taxable-equivalent basis aggregated $3.88 billion in 2020, down 6% from $4.15 billion in 2019. That decline primarily resulted from a 68 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin, largely the result of declines in yields on loans and balances held at the FRB of New York, reflecting the lower interest rate environment due to actions initiated by the Federal Reserve to decrease its target Federal funds rate three times in the second half of 2019 (each by a .25% increment) and twice in March of 2020 (first by .50%, then another by 1.0%). The lower net interest margin was partially offset by the impact of a $14.6 billion, or 14%, increase in average earning assets to $122.9 billion in 2020 from $108.2 billion in 2019 that reflected increases in average loan and lease balances of $7.1 billion and in interest-bearing deposits at banks of $8.5 billion, partially offset by a decline in average balances of investment securities of $3.4 billion. 

Average loans and leases rose $7.1 billion, or 8%, in 2020 from $89.5 billion in 2019. Average balances of commercial loans and leases increased $4.2 billion or 18% to $27.5 billion in 2020 from $23.3 billion in 2019. That increase was the result of average outstanding PPP loans of $4.4 billion that were predominantly funded in the second quarter of 2020. Average commercial real estate loan balances were up $2.1 billion or 6% to $37.0 billion in 2020 from $34.9 billion in 2019. Consumer loans averaged $15.9 billion in 2020, up $1.2 billion or 9% from $14.6 billion in 2019, due to growth in recreational finance loans and automobile loans that was partially offset by declines in outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit. Average residential real estate loans were $16.2 billion in 2020 and $16.7 billion in 2019, reflecting ongoing payments by customers, partially offset by repurchases of government-guaranteed loan from Ginnie Mae pools. These repurchased loans averaged $2.6 billion in 2020, up from $889 million in 2019.

##TABLE_END

International loans included in commercial loans and leases totaled $116 million and $100 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Included in such amounts at each of those dates were $94 million of loans at M&#38;T Bank&#8217;s commercial banking office in Ontario, Canada. The remaining international loans were predominantly to domestic companies with foreign operations.

&#160;

Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit which the Company classifies as consumer loans, represented approximately 59% of the loan and lease portfolio during each of 2021 and 2020, compared with 63% in 2019. At December 31, 2021 , the Company held approximately $35.4 billion of commercial real estate loans (including $425 million held for sale), $16.1 billion of consumer real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties (including $474 million of loans held for sale) and $3.6 billion of outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit, compared with $37.6 billion, $16.8 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Included in commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were construction loans of $9.3 billion and $10.0 billion, respectively, including amounts due from builders and developers of residential real estate aggregating $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Commercial real estate loans included loans held for sale totaling $425 million and $278 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. International loans included in commercial real estate loans totaled $74 million at December 31, 2021 and $60 million at December 31, 2020. 

Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company include both fixed and variable rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity. Maturity dates generally range from five to ten years and, for borrowers in good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the customer following maturity at the then-current market rate of interest. Adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans represented approximately 69% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio at the 2021 year-end. Table 6 presents commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding at December 31, 2021. New York City area commercial real estate loans totaled $8.2 billion at December 31, 2021. The $7.1 billion of investor-owned commercial real estate loans in the New York City area were largely secured by multifamily residential properties, retail space and office space. The Company&#8217;s experience has been that office, retail and service-related properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multifamily residential properties. Approximately 67% of the aggregate dollar amount of New York City area loans were for loans with outstanding balances of $30 million or less, while loans of more than $50 million made up approximately 18% of the total.

Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located in other parts of New York State, Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or business (owner-occupied). Approximately 93% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate loans in New York State secured by properties located outside of the New York City area were for loans with outstanding balances of $30 million or less. Of the outstanding balances of commercial real estate loans in Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area, approximately 81% and 77%, respectively, were for loans with outstanding balances of $30 million or less.

Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic area and New York State comprised 22% of total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2021.

Commercial real estate construction and development loans made to investors presented in table 6 totaled $8.9 billion at December 31, 2021, or 10% of total loans and leases. Approximately 82% of those construction loans had adjustable interest rates. Included in such loans at the 2021 year-end were $1.4 billion of loans to builders and developers of residential real estate properties. The remainder of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio was comprised of loans made for various purposes, including the construction of office buildings, multifamily residential housing, retail space and other commercial development.

M&#38;T Realty Capital Corporation, a commercial real estate lending subsidiary of M&#38;T Bank, participates in the Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (&#8220;DUS&#8221;) program of Fannie Mae, pursuant to which commercial real estate loans are originated in accordance with terms and conditions specified by Fannie Mae and sold. Under this program, loans are sold with partial credit recourse to M&#38;T Realty Capital Corporation. The amount of recourse is generally limited to one-third of any credit loss incurred by the purchaser on an individual loan, although in some cases the recourse amount is less than one-third of the outstanding principal balance. The Company&#8217;s maximum credit risk for recourse associated with sold commercial real estate loans was approximately $4.0 billion at each of December 31, 2021 and 2020. There have been no material losses incurred as a result of those recourse arrangements. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, commercial real estate loans serviced by the Company for other investors were $23.7 billion and $22.2 billion, respectively. Reflected in commercial real estate loans serviced for others were loans sub-serviced for others that had outstanding balances of $3.5 billion and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties were $16.1 billion at December 31, 2021, including approximately 36% secured by properties located in New York State, 7% secured by properties located in Pennsylvania, 17% secured by properties in New Jersey and 17% secured by properties located in other Mid-Atlantic areas. Included in residential real estate loans were loans repurchased by the Company from Ginnie Mae pools as previously described. Those repurchased loans totaled $2.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020. The Company&#8217;s portfolio of limited documentation residential real estate loans held for investment totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with $1.6 billion at December 31, 2020. That portfolio consisted predominantly of limited documentation loans acquired in a prior business combination. Such loans represent loans that at origination typically included some form of limited borrower documentation requirements as compared with more traditional residential real estate loans. The acquired loans that were eligible for limited documentation processing were available in amounts up to 65% of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price of the property. Loans to individuals to finance the construction of one-to-four family residential properties totaled $57 million at December 31, 2021 and $77 million at December 31, 2020, or approximately .1% of total loans and leases at each of those dates. Information about the credit performance of the Company&#8217;s residential real estate loans is included herein under the heading &#8220;Provision For Credit Losses.&#8221;

Consumer loans comprised approximately 19% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2021 and 17% at December 31, 2020. Outstanding balances of recreational finance loans represented the largest component of the consumer loan portfolio at December 31, 2021 and totaled $8.1 billion or approximately 9% of total loans, up from $7.1 billion or 7% at December 31, 2020. That growth reflects continued consumer demand for such loans. Home equity loans and lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $3.6 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. Approximately 41% of home equity loans and lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2021 were secured by properties in New York State, 22% in Maryland, 21% in Pennsylvania and 5% in New Jersey. Outstanding automobile loan balances rose to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2021 from $4.1 billion at December 31, 2020. That increase also reflects continued consumer demand for motor vehicles despite recent supply chain disruptions.

Table 7 presents the composition of the Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio at the end of 2021, including outstanding balances to businesses and consumers in New York State, Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic area and other states.

The investment securities portfolio averaged $6.4 billion in 2021, down from $8.2 billion and $11.6 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decline in average balances of investment securities in 2021 and 2020 was predominantly due to maturities and pay downs of mortgage-backed securities and maturities of U.S. Treasury notes. During 2021 the Company purchased approximately $1.6 billion of fixed rate residential mortgage-backed securities and approximately $680 million of U.S. Treasury notes. There were no significant purchases of investment securities during 2020. During 2019, the Company purchased $500 million of U.S. Treasury notes. Sales of investment securities were not significant in 2021, 2020 or 2019. The Company routinely has increases and decreases in its holdings of capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) of New York and the FRB of New York. Those holdings are accounted for at cost and are adjusted based on the amounts of outstanding borrowings and available lines of credit with those entities.

The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential mortgage-backed securities and shorter-term U.S. Treasury and federal agency notes. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its liquidity position and its overall interest-rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including prepayments. The Company may occasionally sell investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads, actual or anticipated prepayments, credit risk associated with a particular security, or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio in connection with a business combination. The amounts of investment securities held by the Company are influenced by such factors as available yield in comparison with alternative investments, demand for loans, which generally yield more than 

&#160;

investment securities, ongoing repayments, the levels of deposits, and management of liquidity and balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios. 

Fair value changes in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Net unrealized losses on such equity securities were $21 million in 2021 and $9 million in 2020, compared with net unrealized gains of $18 million in 2019. Those gains and losses were predominantly related to the Company&#8217;s holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock. 

The Company regularly reviews its debt investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be indicative of credit-related losses. In light of such reviews, there were no credit-related losses on debt investment securities recognized in 2021, 2020 or 2019. Based on management&#8217;s assessment of future cash flows associated with individual investment securities as of December 31, 2021, the Company did not expect to incur any material credit-related losses in its portfolios of debt investment securities. A further discussion of fair values of investment securities is included herein under the heading &#8220;Capital.&#8221; Additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in notes 3 and 21 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Other earning assets include interest-bearing balances at the FRB of New York and other banks, trading account assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities. Those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged $36.0 billion in 2021, $18.1 billion in 2020 and $7.2 billion in 2019. Interest-bearing deposits at banks averaged $35.8 billion in 2021, compared with $15.3 billion in 2020 and $6.8 billion in 2019. The amounts of interest-bearing deposits at banks at the respective dates were predominantly comprised of deposits held at the FRB of New York. The levels of those deposits often fluctuate due to changes in trust-related deposits of commercial entities, purchases or maturities of investment securities, or borrowings to manage the Company&#8217;s liquidity. The higher amount in 2021 as compared with 2020 and 2019 reflects increased commercial and consumer deposit balances. Agreements to resell securities averaged $167 million, $2.7 billion, $327 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The higher average balance in 2020 reflects the temporary investment by the Company of increased customer deposit levels.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

The most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits. The Company considers noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less as core deposits. The Company&#8217;s branch network is its principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Average core deposits were $125.6 billion in 2021, compared with $105.7 billion in 2020 and $87.9 billion in 2019. Average balances of savings and interest-checking core deposits rose $7.3 billion or 12% in 2021 to $67.0 billion from $59.8 billion in 2020. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $14.0 billion or 34% to $55.7 billion in 2021 from $41.7 billion in 2020. A continuance of the trend observed in 2020, those increases were largely due to 

&#160;

higher average deposits of commercial and consumer customers. Average core deposits in 2020 were up 20% as compared with 2019. Average savings and interest-checking core deposit balances rose $7.9 billion or 15% in 2020 from $51.9 billion in 2019. Average noninterest-bearing deposits in 2020 increased $10.9 billion or 35% from $30.8 million in 2019. Funding provided by core deposits represented 90% of average earning assets in 2021, compared with 86% in 2020 and 81% in 2019. Table 8 summarizes average core deposits in 2021 and percentage changes in the components of such deposits over the past two years. Core deposits totaled $128.0 billion and $114.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The Company also receives funding from other deposit sources, including branch-related time deposits over $250,000, brokered deposits and, prior to June 30, 2021, deposits associated with the Company&#8217;s Cayman Islands office. Time deposits over $250,000 averaged $402 million in 2021, $683 million in 2020 and $956 million in 2019. The decline in such deposits from 2019 through 2021 was predominantly the result of maturities of time deposits and, due to the low interest rate environment, a reduced demand from customers for time deposit products. Cayman Islands office deposits averaged $181 million in 2021, $1.1 billion in 2020 and $1.4 billion in 2019. Those deposits consisted predominantly of balances swept from lower-yielding commercial customer accounts. During the second quarter of 2021, the Company introduced a new interest-bearing sweep product (included in savings and interest-bearing deposits) that replaced the Eurodollar sweep product previously recorded as Cayman Islands office deposits. As a result, there were no outstanding deposits at the Cayman Islands office as of December 31, 2021 and the office is closed. The Company had brokered savings and interest-bearing transaction accounts that averaged $3.8 billion in each of 2021 and 2020, compared with $2.7 billion in 2019. Brokered time deposits were not a 

&#160;

significant source of funding in any of the three years discussed herein. Additional brokered deposits may be added in the future depending on market conditions, including demand by customers and other investors for those deposits, and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time. Time deposits over $250,000 were $345 million and $454 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Total uninsured deposits were estimated to be $69.1 billion at December 31, 2021. 

The Company also uses borrowings from banks, the FHLB of New York, the FRB of New York and others as sources of funding. Short-term borrowings represent arrangements that at the time they were entered into had a contractual maturity of one year or less. Average short-term borrowings were $68 million in 2021, $62 million in 2020 and $1.1 billion in 2019. 

Long-term borrowings averaged $3.5 billion in 2021, $5.8 billion in 2020 and $7.7 billion in 2019. Average balances of outstanding senior notes were $2.4 billion in 2021, compared with $3.8 billion and $5.3 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Unsecured senior notes totaled $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In January 2021, $350 million of variable rate senior notes of M&#38;T Bank matured. During 2020, M&#38;T Bank redeemed $2.1 billion of fixed rate senior notes that were within thirty days of scheduled maturity and, thereby, eligible for redemption. Also included in average long-term borrowings were amounts borrowed from FHLBs of $2 million in 2021 and 2020, compared with $241 million in 2019 and subordinated capital notes of $581 million in 2021, compared with $1.4 billion in each of 2020 and 2019. In March 2021, M&#38;T Bank redeemed $500 million of subordinated capital notes that were due to mature on December 1, 2021 and during December 2020, $409 million of subordinated capital notes of M&#38;T Bank matured. Junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average long-term borrowings were $530 million in 2021, $527 million in 2020 and $524 million in 2019. Additional information regarding long-term borrowings, including information regarding contractual maturities of such borrowings, is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

The Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain components of its loans and long-term debt. As of December 31, 2021, interest rate swap agreements were used as fair value hedges of approximately $1.65 billion of outstanding fixed rate long-term borrowings. Additionally, interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $13.35 billion were used as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans. Further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided herein and in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Changes in the composition of the Company&#8217;s earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as discussed herein, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads, can impact net interest income. Net interest spread, or the difference between the taxable-equivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 2.70% in 2021, compared with 3.00% in 2020 and 3.48% in 2019. The yield on the Company&#8217;s earning assets decreased 59 basis points to 2.84% in 2021 from 3.43% in 2020 and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 29 basis points to .14% in 2021 from .43% in 2020. During 2019, the yield on earning assets was 4.53% and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 1.05%. The lower net interest spreads in 2021 and 2020 as compared with 2019 also reflect the effect of decreases in short-term interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve and the impact of a higher proportion of low-yielding balances at the FRB of New York to total average earning assets. While those low-yielding balances add to net interest income, they have the effect of reducing the yield on total average earning assets and, as a result, the net interest spread. 

Net interest-free funds consist largely of noninterest-bearing demand deposits and shareholders&#8217; equity, partially offset by bank owned life insurance and non-earning assets, including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets. Net interest-free funds averaged $61.1 billion in 2021, $47.3 billion in 2020 and $37.2 billion in 2019. The increase in net interest-free funds in 2021 and in 2020 reflects higher average balances of noninterest-bearing deposits. Those deposits averaged $55.7 billion in 2021, $41.7 billion in 2020 and $30.8 billion in 2019. The increase in such balances since 

&#160;

2019 was largely due to higher levels of deposits of commercial customers. Shareholders&#8217; equity averaged $16.9 billion, $16.0 billion and $15.7 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged $4.6 billion in each of 2021, 2020 and 2019. The cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged $1.86 billion in 2021, $1.84 billion in 2020 and $1.81 billion in 2019. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income, but rather are recorded in &#8220;other revenues from operations.&#8221; The contribution of net interest-free funds to net interest margin was .06% in 2021, .16% in 2020 and .36% in 2019. The reduced contribution of net interest-free funds to net interest margin in 2021 and 2020 reflects the lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities used to value net interest-free funds. 

Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of net interest-free funds as described herein, the Company&#8217;s net interest margin was 2.76% in 2021, 3.16% in 2020 and 3.84% in 2019. Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition of the Company&#8217;s portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads, could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s net interest income and net interest margin.

Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields on earning assets or the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $15.0 billion (excluding $8.4 billion of forward-starting swap agreements) at December 31, 2021, $19.0 billion (excluding $32.1 billion of forward-starting swap agreements) at December 31, 2020 and $17.2 billion (excluding $40.4 billion of forward-starting swap agreements) at December 31, 2019. Under the terms of those interest rate swap agreements, the Company received payments based on the outstanding notional amount at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates. At December 31, 2021, interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of $13.35 billion were serving as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans, compared with $17.35 billion at December 31, 2020 and $13.35 billion at December 31, 2019. Interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of $1.65 billion at each of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and $3.80 billion at December 31, 2019 were serving as fair value hedges of fixed rate long-term borrowings. The Company has entered into the forward-starting interest rate swap agreements predominantly to extend the term of its interest rate swap agreements serving as cash flow hedges, and provide a hedge against changing interest rates on certain of its variable rate loans. 

In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded as an adjustment to the interest income or interest expense of the respective hedged item. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were not material to the Company&#8217;s consolidated results of operations. In a cash flow hedge, the derivative&#8217;s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Information regarding cash flow hedges is presented in note 16 of Notes to Financial Statements. Information regarding the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and hedge ineffectiveness is presented in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items primarily result from the effects of changing interest rates and 

&#160;

spreads. The average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes, the related effect on net interest income and margin, and the weighted-average interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in table 10.

Provision for Credit Losses

As described in note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements, effective January 1, 2020 the Company adopted amended accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. That guidance requires an allowance for credit losses to be deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net carrying value that is expected to be collected over the contractual term of the assets considering relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The guidance replaced the previous incurred loss model for determining the allowance for credit losses. The adoption of the amended guidance resulted in a $132 million increase in the allowance for credit losses at January 1, 2020. Increases in the allowance for residential real estate loans and consumer loans, reflecting the longer-dated maturities of such portfolios, were offset somewhat by net decreases in the allowance for commercial loans resulting from lower loss estimates on demand loan products due to the assumption that the Company could require full repayment of such loans in the near-term. Table 11 depicts the changes in the allowance for credit losses by loan category resulting from the adoption of the amended guidance.

&#160;

The amended guidance requires estimated credit losses on loans acquired at a discount to be reflected in the allowance for credit losses. Previously, such losses were netted in the carrying value of the loans unless there was an increased loss expectation subsequent to their acquisition. The gross-up of the estimated losses on loans acquired at a discount that was previously not recognized in the allowance for credit losses was $18 million on January 1, 2020. Prior to January 1, 2020, the Company generally recognized interest income on loans acquired at a discount regardless of the borrowers&#8217; repayment status. Effective with the adoption of the accounting guidance, the Company&#8217;s nonaccrual loan policy applied to loans acquired at a discount. Loans acquired at a discount at December 31, 2019 included $171 million of loans that, effective with the adoption of the guidance, were classified as non-accrual loans on January 1, 2020.

A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance to reflect expected credit losses that are based on economic forecasts as of each reporting date. A provision for credit loss recapture of $75 million was recorded in 2021, compared with provisions for credit losses of $800 million in 2020 and $176 million in 2019. As noted earlier, the recapture in 2021 and the significant increase in the provision in 2020 as compared with 2019 follows the adoption of accounting guidance on January 1, 2020 and reflects economic assumptions and projections that considered the macroeconomic outlook associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recovery. The Company&#8217;s estimates of expected losses reflect the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on economic activity, generally, and concerns about commercial real estate values and the ultimate collectability of real estate loans for which borrowers had previously received forbearance as a result of the pandemic. Net charge-offs of loans were $192 million in 2021, $247 million in 2020 and $144 million in 2019. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding were .20% in 2021, compared with .26% in 2020 and .16% in 2019. A summary of the Company&#8217;s loan charge-offs, provision and allowance for credit losses is presented in table 12 and in note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Nonaccrual loans aggregated $2.06 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with $1.89 billion and $963 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding, nonaccrual loans represented 2.22% at December 31, 2021, compared with 1.92% and 1.06% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The higher level of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2021 as compared with December 31, 2020 reflects the continuing impact of the pandemic on borrowers&#8217; ability to make contractual payments on their loans, most notably loans in the hospitality sector. The higher level at December 31, 2020 as compared with December 31, 2019 reflects the addition in 2020 of $530 million of loans associated with hotels as well as other additions that, in general, resulted from the economic conditions in 2020. A summary of nonperforming assets and certain past due, renegotiated and impaired loan data and credit quality ratios is presented in table 13.

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were $963 million or 1.04% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2021 and $859 million or .87% at December 31, 2020. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more (excluding loans acquired at a discount) were $519 million or .57% at December 31, 2019. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more included loans guaranteed by government-related entities of $928 million, $798 million and $480 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Guaranteed loans included one-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company that were repurchased to reduce associated servicing costs, including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors. Despite the loans being purchased by the Company, the insurance or guarantee by the applicable government-related entity remains in force. The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans included in the amounts noted above that are guaranteed by government-related entities totaled $889 million at December 31, 2021, $764 million at December 31, 2020 and $452 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in such loans as compared with December 31, 2019 reflects loans repurchased during 2021 and 2020. The remaining accruing loans past due 90 days or more not guaranteed by government-related entities were loans considered to be with creditworthy borrowers 

&#160;

that were in the process of collection or renewal. In addition to the past due loans, the Company also has $974 million of government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans as of December 31, 2021 that are not considered delinquent because the borrower has requested and received a COVID-19 related payment deferral. In general, those loans were also repurchased to reduce associated servicing costs as described above and also remain covered by the insurance or guarantee of the applicable government-related entity, but are not considered to be past due in accordance with the accounting treatment afforded under the CARES Act and related regulatory and financial accounting guidance as described below and in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

Loans that were 30-89 days past due were $846 million at December 31, 2021, compared with $662 million at December 31, 2020 and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Loans that are still subject to a COVID-19 related payment deferral are classified as current in accordance with regulatory guidance and, as a result, did not contribute to incremental additions to loans categorized as 30-89 days past due. COVID-19 related modified loans that exit the deferral period and subsequently fail to make contractual payments in accordance with the modified terms are reported in the applicable delinquency classification per M&#38;T Bank&#8217;s credit policy. Information about delinquent loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020 is included in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Prior to the adoption of the new accounting standard on January 1, 2020, the Company reported purchased impaired loans. Those loans were impaired at the date of acquisition, were recorded at estimated fair value and were generally delinquent in payments, but, in accordance with GAAP, the Company continued to accrue interest income on such loans based on the estimated expected cash flows associated with the loans. The amended accounting guidance requires estimated credit losses on loans acquired at a discount to now be reflected in the allowance for credit losses and effective with the adoption of the guidance, the Company&#8217;s nonaccrual loan policy applies to such loans. The carrying amount of purchased impaired loans was $228 million at December 31, 2019. 

The direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a dramatic reduction in 2020 in economic activity that severely hampered the ability of some businesses and consumers to meet their repayment obligations. The CARES Act, in addition to providing financial assistance to both businesses and consumers, created a forbearance program for federally-backed mortgage loans, protected borrowers from negative credit reporting due to loan accommodations related to the pandemic, and provided financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings for a limited period of time to account for the effects of COVID-19. The banking regulatory agencies likewise issued guidance encouraging financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are, or may be, unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of COVID-19. That guidance, with concurrence of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and provisions of the CARES Act, allowed modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were generally current with their payments prior to any relief, to not be treated as delinquent or as troubled debt restructurings. Modifications included payment deferrals (including extensions of maturity dates), covenant waivers and fee waivers. The Company worked with its customers affected by COVID-19 and granted modifications across many of its loan portfolios. To the extent that such modifications met the criteria previously described, such modifications have not been classified as delinquent or as troubled debt restructurings. A summary of loans for which COVID-19 forbearances are still in effect and which are not considered past due is included in note 4 of Notes to the Financial Statements.

The Company also modified the terms of select loans in an effort to assist borrowers that were not related to the COVID-19 pandemic. If the borrower was experiencing financial difficulty and a concession was granted, the Company considered such modifications as troubled debt restructurings. Loan modifications included such actions as the extension of loan maturity dates and the lowering of 

&#160;

interest rates and monthly payments. The objective of the modifications was to increase loan repayments by customers and thereby reduce net charge-offs. Information about modifications of loans that are considered troubled debt restructurings is included in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

Residential real estate loans modified under specified loss mitigation programs prescribed by government guarantors that were not related to the COVID-19 pandemic have not been included in renegotiated loans because the loan guarantee remains in full force and, accordingly, the Company has not granted a concession with respect to the ultimate collection of the original loan balance. Such loans totaled $425 million and $342 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Charge-offs of commercial loans and leases, net of recoveries, aggregated $82 million in 2021, $119 million in 2020 and $34 million in 2019. As a percentage of average commercial loans, those net charge-offs were .32%, .43%, and .14% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Commercial loans and leases in nonaccrual status were $221 million at December 31, 2021, $307 million at December 31, 2020 and $347 million at December 31, 2019. Net charge-offs of commercial real estate loans totaled $71 million during 2021, compared with $31 million during 2020 and $9 million in 2019 or .19% in 2021, .08% in 2020 and .03% in 2019 of average commercial real estate loans. The higher levels of net charge-offs in 2021 and 2020 of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans reflect the impact of the pandemic on borrowers&#8217; abilities to repay loans. In the commercial real estate portfolio, those charged-off loans were mostly associated with the retail, office building and hospitality sectors. Commercial real estate loans classified as nonaccrual were $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021, $891 million at December 31, 2020 and $195 million at December 31, 2019. Nonaccrual commercial real estate loans included construction-related loans of $114 million, $115 million and $37 million at the end of 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in commercial real estate loans in nonaccrual status since December 31, 2019 was largely reflective of loans in the hospitality sector. Hotel-related commercial real estate loans (including construction) in nonaccrual status at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $696 million and $607 million, respectively.

Net charge-offs of residential real estate loans were $2 million in 2021, $3 million in 2020 and $5 million in 2019 representing .01% of average residential real estate loans in 2021, compared with .02% in 2020 and .03% in 2019. Residential real estate loans in nonaccrual status at December 31, 2021 were $479 million, compared with $513 million and $319 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Nonaccrual limited documentation first mortgage loans aggregated $123 million at December 31, 2021, compared with $147 million and $83 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Limited documentation first mortgage loans represent loans secured by residential real estate that at origination typically included some form of limited borrower documentation requirements as compared with more traditional loans. The Company no longer originates limited documentation loans. Residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest (excluding loans acquired at a discount prior to 2020) totaled $920 million at December 31, 2021, $793 million at December 31, 2020 and $487 million at December 31, 2019. A substantial portion of such amounts related to guaranteed loans repurchased from government-related entities, including the previously noted higher level of repurchases of loans associated with the Company&#8217;s loan servicing portfolio. However, loans that have been granted forbearances related to COVID-19 that are still in effect are not considered to be past due in accordance with the previously noted regulatory guidance and provisions of the CARES Act. Information about the location of nonaccrual and charged-off residential real estate loans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 is presented in table 14.

Net charge-offs of consumer loans aggregated $38 million in 2021, compared with $93 million in 2020 and $97 million in 2019. As a percentage of average consumer loans those net charge-offs were .22% in 2021, .59% in 2020 and .67% in 2019. Included in net charge-offs of consumer loans were: net recoveries of automobile loans of $2 million in 2021, compared with net charge-offs of $22 million in 2020 and $24 million in 2019&#59; recreational finance loan net charge-offs of $13 million, $27 million and $26 million during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively&#59; and net recoveries of home equity loans and lines of credit secured by one-to-four family residential properties of $3 million in 2021, compared with net charge-offs of $3 million in 2020 and $6 million in 2019. The reduced level of net charge-offs of consumer loans in 2021 reflects the improving economy, in general, and the level of prices associated with motor vehicles, recreational vehicles and residential real estate. Nonaccrual consumer loans were $177 million at December 31, 2021, compared with $183 million and $102 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Included in nonaccrual consumer loans at the 2021, 2020 and 2019 year-ends were: automobile loans of $34 million, $39 million and $21 million, respectively&#59; recreational finance loans of $28 million, $26 million and $14 million, respectively&#59; and outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit of $70 million, $79 million and $63 million, respectively. Information about the location of nonaccrual and charged-off home equity loans and lines of credit as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 is presented in table 14. Information about past due and nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 is also included in note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Real estate and other foreclosed assets totaled $24 million at December 31, 2021, compared with $35 million at December 31, 2020 and $86 million at December 31, 2019. The decline in 2020 and 2021 is largely reflective of foreclosure moratoriums imposed by government authorities in numerous jurisdictions. Net gains or losses associated with real estate and other foreclosed assets were not material in 2021, 2020 or 2019. At December 31, 2021, foreclosed assets are comprised entirely of the Company&#8217;s holding of residential real estate-related properties.

Beginning in 2020, management determined the allowance for credit losses under amended accounting guidance that requires estimating the amount of current expected credit losses over the remaining contractual term of the loan and lease portfolio. Prior to 2020, the allowance for credit losses represented the amount that in management&#8217;s judgment reflected incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. A description of the methodologies used by the Company to estimate its allowance for credit losses can be found in note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

In establishing the allowance for credit losses subsequent to December 31, 2019, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits identified through both normal and targeted credit review processes and also estimates losses for other loans and leases with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. For purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company evaluates its loan and lease portfolio by type. Despite recent improvements in macroeconomic forecasts, at the time of the Company&#8217;s analysis regarding the determination of the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2021, concerns persisted about the somewhat uneven and incomplete recovery evident in the economy, the emergence of new COVID-19 variants (including the recent emerging variant commonly referred to as Omicron) that may further disrupt a recovery, the ultimate effectiveness of economic stimulus being provided by the U.S. government that has contributed to increased deficit spending and raised inflation concerns&#59; disruptions to supply chains and the related impacts to businesses and consumers&#59; the volatile nature of global markets, including the impact international economic conditions could have on the U.S. economy&#59; Federal Reserve positioning of monetary policy&#59; the extent to which borrowers, in particular commercial real estate borrowers may continue to be negatively affected by pandemic-related and general economic conditions&#59; and continued stagnant population and economic growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions (approximately 48% of the Company&#8217;s loans and leases are to customers in New York State and Pennsylvania) that could see lingering effects of the economic 

&#160;

downturn. The Company utilizes a loan grading system to differentiate risk amongst its commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. Loans with a lower expectation of default are assigned one of ten possible &#8220;pass&#8221; loan grades while specific loans determined to have an elevated level of credit risk are classified as &#8220;criticized.&#8221; A criticized loan may be classified as &#8220;nonaccrual&#8221; if the Company no longer expects to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more. During 2021 and 2020, the Company re-graded significant portions of its commercial loans and commercial real estate loans based on financial results and projections of specific borrowers, particularly those that were affected by COVID-19 impacts. Criticized commercial loans and commercial real estate loans totaled $9.0 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with $7.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The rise in criticized loans reflects the impact of the pandemic on borrowers&#8217; financial condition and the re-grading of loans by the Company, and is reflective of the provision for expected credit losses recorded by the Company in 2020 as the pandemic unfolded. The increases in such loans since December 31, 2020 were largely attributable to investor-owned permanent commercial real estate loans in the hotel, office and healthcare sectors and commercial real estate construction loans in the hotel and healthcare sectors. On the overall basis, weighted-average loan-to-stabilized value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) ratios for investor-owned commercial real estate properties do not vary significantly by asset class or sector, and at December 31, 2021 were generally within the range of 55% to 65% with an overall weighted-average LTV ratio of approximately 57%. Investor-owned commercial real estate loans comprised $7.0 billion, or 78% of total criticized loans of $9.0 billion at December 31, 2021. 

The COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental responses led to a significant reduction in economic activity that was detrimental to many borrowers across the Company&#8217;s geographic regions, particularly commercial borrowers in the hotel, health care-related and office sectors and residential mortgage borrowers. Many of these borrowers have been and could likely continue to be adversely impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 related modifications with payment deferrals at December 31, 2021 totaled $1.2 billion and consisted predominantly of residential real estate loans, including $974 million of government-guaranteed loans. Substantially all of those deferrals are scheduled to expire during 2022 and/or are in the process of formal modification of repayment terms for previously deferred payments. 

As commercial loans and commercial real estate loans were approved for modifications related to COVID-19, the Company assessed loans considering the credit worthiness of the borrower, collateral values, the financial condition of any guarantors, and the expected collectability of contractual principal and interest payments. Loan-to-collateral values on investor-owned loans are generally relatively low and oftentimes the loans include some form of recourse. Loans secured by residential real estate with a COVID-19 payment forbearance were evaluated for collectability based on the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay considering past performance and estimated collateral values. If collectability was considered doubtful, loans were classified as nonaccrual.

Loan officers in different geographic locations with the support of the Company&#8217;s credit department personnel review and reassign loan grades based on their detailed knowledge of individual borrowers and their judgment of the impact on such borrowers resulting from changing conditions in their respective regions. The Company re-assessed its loan grades for those borrowers most impacted by COVID-19. The Company&#8217;s policy is that, at least annually, updated financial information is obtained from commercial borrowers associated with pass grade loans and additional analysis performed. On a quarterly basis, the Company&#8217;s centralized credit department reviews all criticized commercial loans and commercial real estate loans greater than $1 million to determine the appropriateness of the assigned loan grade, including whether the loan should be reported as accruing or nonaccruing. For criticized nonaccrual loans, additional meetings are held with loan officers and their managers, workout specialists and senior management to discuss each of the relationships. In analyzing criticized loans, borrower-specific information is reviewed, including operating results, future cash flows, recent developments and the borrower&#8217;s outlook, and other pertinent data. The 

&#160;

timing and extent of potential losses, considering collateral valuation and other factors, and the Company&#8217;s potential courses of action are contemplated. 

With regard to residential real estate loans, the Company&#8217;s loss identification and estimation techniques make reference to loan performance and house price data in specific areas of the country where collateral securing the Company&#8217;s residential real estate loans is located. For residential real estate-related loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, the excess of the loan balance over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan is charged-off when the loan becomes 150 days delinquent. That charge-off is based on recent indications of value from external parties that are generally obtained shortly after a loan becomes nonaccrual. Loans to consumers that file for bankruptcy are generally charged off to estimated net collateral value shortly after the Company is notified of such filings. At December 31, 2021, approximately 61% of the Company&#8217;s home equity portfolio consisted of first lien loans and lines of credit. Of the remaining junior lien loans in the portfolio, approximately &#160; 56% (or approximately 22% of the aggregate home equity portfolio) consisted of junior lien loans that were behind a first lien mortgage loan that was not owned or serviced by the Company. To the extent known by the Company, if a senior lien loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency, even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the Company, the junior lien loan or line that is owned by the Company is placed on nonaccrual status. In monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses, the Company reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent charge-off experience. When evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for charge off and for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses, the Company considers the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property. Home equity line of credit terms vary but such lines are generally originated with an open draw period of ten years followed by an amortization period of up to twenty years. At December 31, 2021, approximately 85% of all outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit related to lines that were still in the draw period, the weighted-average remaining draw periods were approximately five years, and approximately 10% were making contractually allowed payments that do not include any repayment of principal.

Factors that influence the Company&#8217;s credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Company&#8217;s real estate loan portfolios. Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, and general economic conditions affecting consumers.

The Company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. To estimate expected losses, the Company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The Company&#8217;s approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases has included utilizing macro-economic assumptions to project losses over a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. Subsequent to the forecast period, the Company reverted to longer-term historical loss experience, over a period of one year, to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life. Forward-looking estimates of certain macro-economic variables are determined by the M&#38;T Scenario Development Group, which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists. Among the assumptions utilized as of December 31, 2021 was that the national unemployment rate will average 4.6% through the first year of the reasonable and 

&#160;

supportable forecast period before gradually improving to 3.7% in the latter half of 2023. The forecast also assumed gross domestic product grows during 2022 at a 3.1% annual rate and during 2023 at a 2.7% average rate. Commercial real estate and residential real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively grow 11.1% and 5.9%, respectively, over the two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. The assumptions utilized in estimating the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020 included an estimated unemployment rate averaging 6.9% through 2021 followed by a gradual return to long-term historical averages by the end of 2022. Gross domestic product was assumed to grow at a 4.1% annual rate during 2021 resulting in a return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022. Commercial real estate prices were assumed to decline by approximately 6.8% in 2021, followed by improvement. Residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate significantly. In most instances the actual macroeconomic conditions experienced in 2021 were favorable in comparison to the forecasts made at December 31, 2020. Such improvements contributed to the recapture of provision for credit losses during 2021 of $75 million. The assumptions utilized as of January 1, 2020 at the time of the adoption of the expected credit loss accounting standard were significantly less severe. Those assumptions anticipated unemployment rates that averaged under 4% and steady growth in gross domestic product of 3.3% over the eight-quarter forecast period. Forecasted changes in real estate prices as of that date were not significant. The assumptions utilized were based on information available to the Company at or near December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020 (at the time it was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dates). 

In establishing the allowance for credit losses the Company also considers the impact of portfolio concentrations, changes in underwriting practices, product expansions into new markets, imprecision in its economic forecasts, and other risk factors that influence its loss estimation process. With respect to economic forecasts, the Company assessed the likelihood of alternative economic scenarios during the two-year reasonable and supportable time period. Economic forecasts have changed rapidly in the recent past due to the uncertain impacts of COVID-19. Generally, an increase in unemployment rate or a decrease in any of the rate of change in gross domestic product, commercial real estate prices or home prices would have an adverse impact on expected credit losses and would likely result in an increase in the allowance for credit losses. Forward looking economic forecasts are subject to inherent imprecision and future events may differ materially from actual events. In consideration of such uncertainty, the following alternative economic scenarios were considered to estimate the possible impact on modeled credit losses.

&#8226; A potential downside economic scenario assumed the unemployment rate reaches 9.0% in 2022 before declining to 7.1% by the end of the reasonable and supportable forecast period. The scenario also assumed gross domestic product contracts 2.1% in 2022 before recovering to recently experienced levels by the third quarter of 2023, commercial real estate prices cumulatively decline 12.4% by the end of 2023, and residential real estate prices decline modestly in 2022 and remain flat during 2023. 

&#8226; A potential upside economic scenario assumed the unemployment rate declines to 3.0% in 2022&#8217;s fourth quarter where it stays for the remainder of the reasonable and supportable forecast period. The scenario also assumes gross domestic product grows 4.8% in 2022 and 1.5% in 2023, while commercial real estate and residential real estate prices cumulatively rise 16.9% and 7.6%, respectively, over the two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. 

The scenario analyses resulted in an additional $222 million of modeled credit losses under the assumptions of the downside economic scenario, whereas under the assumptions of the upside economic scenario a $56 million reduction in modeled credit losses could occur. These examples are only a few of the numerous possible economic scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of expected credit losses. The estimated impacts on credit losses in such scenarios pertain 

&#160;

only to modeled credit losses and do not include consideration of other factors the Company may evaluate when determining its allowance for credit losses. 

As a result, it is possible that the Company may, at another point in time, reach different conclusions regarding credit loss estimates. The Company&#8217;s process for determining the allowance for credit losses undergoes quarterly and periodic evaluations by independent risk management personnel, which among many other considerations, evaluate the reasonableness of management&#8217;s methodology and significant assumptions. Further information about the Company&#8217;s methodology to estimate expected credit losses is included in note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Prior to 2020, the allowance for credit losses represented the amount that in management&#8217;s judgment reflected incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance was determined by management&#8217;s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the current economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. The estimation of the allowance for credit losses prior to 2020 did not consider reasonable and supportable forecasts that could have affected the collectability of the reported amounts. 

A comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year-ends is presented in table 15. Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each year-end assessment and using the methodologies described herein. Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage of those loans reflect the impact of the new accounting rules effective January 1, 2020 as well as changes in management&#8217;s estimate of credit losses in light of economic developments. Furthermore, the Company&#8217;s allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category. Additional information about the allowance for credit losses is included in note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2021 appropriately reflected expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for credit losses totaled $1.47 billion at December 31, 2021, $1.74 billion at December 31, 2020, and $1.18 billion at January 1, 2020 when amended guidance became effective. The allowance for credit losses was $1.05 billion at December 31, 2019. The decrease in the allowance in 2021 reflects improved financial forecasts as compared with those as of December 31, 2020. The increase in the allowance in 2020 as compared with 2019 reflected the $132 million addition attributable the adoption of the new accounting standard as well as the expected impact of forecasted economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic on borrowers&#8217; abilities to repay loans. As a percentage of loans outstanding, the allowance was 1.58% at December 31, 2021, 1.76% at December 31, 2020 and 1.16% at December 31, 2019. Excluding the impact of $1.2 billion and $5.4 billion of government-guaranteed PPP loans outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, the allowance as a percentage of total loans and leases was 1.60% and 1.86%, respectively. The level of the allowance reflects management&#8217;s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors as described herein. Should the various economic forecasts and credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should management&#8217;s assessment of losses in the loan portfolio also change, the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods. The reported level of the allowance reflects management&#8217;s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date. 

The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total nonaccrual loans at the end of 2021, 2020 and 2019 was 71%, 92% and 109%, respectively. Given the Company&#8217;s general position as a secured lender and its practice of charging off loan balances when collection is deemed doubtful, that ratio and changes in the ratio are generally not an indicative measure of the adequacy of the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses, nor does management rely upon that ratio in assessing the adequacy of the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses. 

The Company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2021, however residential real estate loans comprised approximately 17% of the loan portfolio. Outstanding loans to foreign borrowers aggregated $197 million at December 31, 2021, or .2% of total loans and leases.

Other Income

Other income aggregated $2.17 billion in 2021, up from $2.09 billion and $2.06 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The rise in other income from 2020 to 2021 was largely attributable to higher trust income, service charges on deposit accounts, brokerage services income, merchant discount and credit card fees and letter of credit and other credit-related fees, partially offset by lower trading account and foreign exchange gains, higher valuation losses on investment securities and a decline in the level of distributions from BLG. The growth experienced from 2019 to 2020 reflected higher mortgage banking revenues and trust income, partially offset by declines in service charges on deposit accounts, trading account and foreign exchange gains and letter of credit and other credit-related fees. 

Mortgage banking revenues aggregated $571 million in 2021, $567 million in 2020 and $458 million in 2019. Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities. The Company&#8217;s involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities includes the origination, sales and servicing of loans under the multifamily loan programs of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Residential mortgage banking revenues, consisting of realized gains from sales of residential real estate loans and loan servicing rights, unrealized gains and losses on residential real estate loans 

&#160;

held for sale and related commitments, residential real estate loan servicing fees, and other residential real estate loan-related fees and income, were $406 million in 2021 , $424 million in 2020 and $317 million in 2019 . The higher residential mortgage banking revenues in 2021 and 2020 as compared with 2019 resulted from higher gains associated with loans held for sale, reflecting higher origination volumes and improved margins. Late in the third quarter of 2021, the Company began to originate the majority of its residential real estate loans to retain in its loan portfolio rather than for sale, contributing to the reduction in residential mortgage banking revenues from 2020. 

New commitments to originate residential real estate loans to be sold were approximately $3.9 billion in 2021, compared with $4.5 billion in 2020 and $2.7 billion in 2019. The decrease in 2021 from 2020 reflects the retention of originated residential real estate loans beginning late in the third quarter of 2021. Realized gains from sales of residential real estate loans and loan servicing rights and recognized net unrealized gains or losses attributable to residential real estate loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans aggregated to gains of $164 million in 2021, $191 million in 2020 and $72 million in 2019.

Loans held for sale that were secured by residential real estate totaled $474 million and $777 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Commitments to sell residential real estate loans and commitments to originate residential real estate loans for sale at pre-determined rates totaled $617 million and $233 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021, $1.47 billion and $1.03 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2020 and $713 million and $423 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Net recognized unrealized gains on residential real estate loans held for sale, commitments to sell loans and commitments to originate loans for sale were $10 million at December 31, 2021, compared with $52 million at December 31, 2020 and $12 million at December 31, 2019. Changes in such net unrealized gains are recorded in mortgage banking revenues and resulted in a net decrease in revenue of $16 million in 2021, compared with net increases of $40 million and $5 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Revenues from servicing residential real estate loans for others totaled $242 million in 2021 compared with $233 million in 2020 and $245 million in 2019. Residential real estate loans serviced for others aggregated $97.9 billion at December 31, 2021, $94.4 billion a year earlier and $95.1 billion at December 31, 2019. Reflected in residential real estate loans serviced for others were loans sub-serviced for others of $74.7 billion, $68.1 billion and $62.8 billion at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenues earned for sub-servicing loans totaled $153 million in 2021, compared with $129 million in 2020 and $125 million in 2019. The contractual servicing rights associated with loans sub-serviced by the Company were predominantly held by affiliates of BLG. Information about the Company&#8217;s relationship with BLG and its affiliates is included in note 25 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

Capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets totaled $217 million at December 31, 2021 (net of a $24 million valuation allowance), compared with $201 million (net of a $30 million valuation allowance) and $237 million (net of a $7 million valuation allowance) at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Reflecting changes in fair value of some of the servicing rights in comparison to the amortized cost of such rights, a $6 million reversal of the valuation allowance for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights was recorded in 2021, compared with provisions of $23 million and $7 million recorded in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additional information about the Company&#8217;s capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets, including information about the calculation of estimated fair value, is presented in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $165 million in 2021, compared with $143 million in 2020 and $141 million in 2019. Included in such amounts were revenues from loan origination and sales activities of $89 million in 2021, $84 million in 2020 and $81 million in 2019. Commercial real estate loans originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately $4.0 billion 

&#160;

in each of 2021 and 2019 , compared with $3.4 billion in 2020 . Loan servicing revenues totaled $76 million in 2021 , $59 million in 2020 and $60 million in 2019 . The higher servicing revenues in 2021 were reflective of fees received from customers who repaid loans prior to maturity. Capitalized commercial mortgage servicing assets were $133 million at each of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and $131 million at December 31, 2019 . Commercial real estate loans serviced for other investors totaled $23.7 billion at December 31, 2021 , $22.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and $21.0 billion at December 31, 2019 , and included $4.0 billion at each of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2019 of loan balances for which investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are ultimately uncollectable. Included in commercial real estate loans serviced for others were loans sub-serviced for others of $3.5 billion at December 31, 2021, $3.3 billion at December 31, 2020 . and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2019 . Commitments to sell commercial real estate loans and commitments to originate commercial real estate loans for sale aggregated $751 million and $325 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021 , $641 million and $364 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020 and $193 million and $164 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019 . Commercial real estate loans held for sale were $425 million, $278 million and $28 million at December 31, 2021 , 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The higher balances at December 31, 2021 and 2020, as compared with December 31, 2019, reflect loans originated later in each year that had not been delivered to investors by year end. 

Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $402 million in 2021, compared with $371 million in 2020 and $433 million in 2019. The lower service charges in 2020 as compared with 2021 and 2019 reflect reduced consumer service charges, predominantly resulting from COVID-19 related fee waivers and lower customer transaction activity. The decrease from 2019 to 2020 also reflected lower commercial service charges, largely due to higher customer deposit levels that could be used by those customers to offset transaction related fees. In February 2022, the Company announced it will be eliminating non-sufficient funds fees and overdraft protection transfer charges from linked deposit accounts as well as reducing overdraft fees and limiting daily fee assessments to once per day. The Company estimates these changes will reduce income from service charges on deposit accounts by approximately $40 million in 2022.

Trust income includes fees related to two significant businesses. The Institutional Client Services (&#8220;ICS&#8221;) business provides a variety of trustee, agency, investment management and administrative services for corporations and institutions, investment bankers, corporate tax, finance and legal executives, and other institutional clients who: (i) use capital markets financing structures&#59; (ii) use independent trustees to hold retirement plan and other assets&#59; and (iii) need investment and cash management services. The Wealth Advisory Services (&#8220;WAS&#8221;) business offers personal trust, planning, fiduciary, asset management, family office and other services designed to help high net worth individuals and families grow, preserve and transfer wealth. Trust income was $645 million in 2021, compared with $602 million in 2020 and $573 million in 2019. Revenues associated with the ICS business were $375 million in 2021, $342 million in 2020 and $311 million in 2019. The increases in ICS revenue in 2021 and 2020 reflect sales activities and increased retirement services income resulting from growth in collective fund balances. Revenues attributable to WAS totaled $255 million in 2021 and $233 million in each of 2020 and 2019. As compared with the previous two years, revenue in 2021 reflected an increase related to equity market performance. Revenue in 2021 and 2020 was offset by proprietary fund money market fee waivers as a result of the low interest rate environment. Trust assets under management were $165.6 billion and $135.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Trust assets under management include the Company&#8217;s proprietary mutual funds&#8217; assets of $13.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and $12.9 billion at December 31, 2020. Additional trust income from investment management activities was $15 million, $27 million and $29 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and includes fees earned from retail customer investment accounts.

&#160;

Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees and, since June 2021, sales of select investment products of LPL Financial (as described below), totaled $63 million in 2021 , compared with $47 million in 2020 and $49 million in 2019 . The increase in brokerage services income in 2021 reflects a change in June 2021 in product delivery to retail brokerage and certain trust customers related to the LPL Financial relationship. Revenues associated with the sale of investment products of LPL Financial, an independent financial services broker, are included in &#8220;brokerage services income.&#8221; Prior to the transition to LPL Financial&#8217;s product platform, revenues earned by the Company from providing those customers with proprietary trust products managed by the Company were reported as trust income. Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $24 million in 2021, $41 million in 2020 and $62 million in 2019. The decline in gains resulted predominantly from decreased activity related to interest rate swap agreements with commercial customers. The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts with customers who need such services and concomitantly enters into offsetting trading positions with third parties to minimize the risks involved with these types of transactions. Information about the notional amount of interest rate, foreign exchange and other contracts entered into by the Company for trading account purposes is included in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements and herein under the heading &#8220;Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity.&#8221; 

The Company recognized net losses on investment securities of $21 million and $9 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, compared with net gains of $18 million in 2019. The gains and losses represented unrealized gains and losses on investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock. 

Other revenues from operations totaled $483 million in 2021, compared with $471 million in 2020 and $469 million in 2019. Comparing 2021 with 2020, higher merchant discount, credit card interchange and letter of credit and credit-related fees, largely loan syndication fees, were partially offset by lower income received from BLG during 2021. Comparing 2020 with 2019, higher income received from BLG during 2020 was offset by declines in letter of credit and credit-related fees, predominantly loan syndication fees.

Included in other revenues from operations were the following significant components. Letter of credit and other credit-related fees totaled $128 million, $109 million and $124 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increased level of such fees in 2021 and 2019 resulted largely from higher loan syndication fees as compared with 2020. Revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees were $140 million in 2021, $111 million in 2020 and $117 million in 2019. The higher level of such revenues in 2021 was the result of increased customer transaction activity reflecting lessened pandemic related restrictions on business and customer activity as compared with 2020. Tax-exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance, which includes increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received, aggregated $47 million in 2021, $48 million in 2020 and $50 million in 2019. Insurance-related sales commissions and other revenues totaled $47 million in each of 2021, 2020 and 2019. Automated teller machine usage fees aggregated $11 million in 2021, $9 million in 2020 and $13 million in 2019.

M&#38;T&#8217;s investment in BLG resulted in cash distributions declared and paid by BLG that are included in &#8220;other revenues from operations&#8221; of $30 million in 2021, $53 million in 2020 and $37 million in 2019. During 2017, the operating losses of BLG resulted in M&#38;T reducing the carrying value of its investment in BLG to zero. Subsequently, M&#38;T has received cash distributions when declared by BLG that result in the recognition of income by M&#38;T. M&#38;T expects cash distributions from BLG in the future, but the timing and amount of those distributions cannot be estimated. BLG is entitled to receive distributions from its affiliates that provide asset management and other services that are available for distribution to BLG&#8217;s owners, including M&#38;T. Information about the 

&#160;

Company&#8217;s relationship with BLG and its affiliates is included in note 25 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

&#160;

Other Expense

Other expense aggregated $3.61 billion in 2021, compared with $3.39 billion in 2020 and $3.47 billion in 2019. Included in those amounts are expenses considered to be &#8220;nonoperating&#8221; in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $10 million, $15 million and $19 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively and merger-related expenses of $44 million in 2021. No merger-related expenses were incurred in 2020 and 2019. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses aggregated $3.56 billion in 2021, $3.37 billion in 2020 and $3.45 billion in 2019. The higher level of noninterest operating expenses in 2021 as compared with the prior year reflected increased costs for salaries and employee benefits (predominantly incentive compensation), outside data processing and software, FDIC assessments, and professional services expenses, partially offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights as compared to an increase in 2020. Contributing to the lower level of noninterest operating expense in 2020 as compared with 2019 were decreased costs for professional services, legal-related matters, advertising and marketing, and travel and entertainment. Additionally, a $48 million charge was recorded in 2019 to reduce the carrying value of an investment in an asset manager that had been accounted for using the equity method of accounting to its estimated realizable value. Those factors were partially offset by higher costs for salaries and employee benefits, outside data processing and software, increases to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights and $14 million of expenses related to the planned transition of the support for the Company&#8217;s retail brokerage and advisory business to the platform of LPL Financial.

Salaries and employee benefits expense aggregated $2.05 billion in 2021, compared with $1.95 billion and $1.90 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The higher levels of expenses in 2021 as compared with 2020 reflect the impact of higher incentive compensation, including commissions, as well as merit and other increases for employees. Stock-based compensation totaled $85 million in 2021, compared with $80 million in 2020 and $76 million in 2019. The number of full-time equivalent employees were 17,421 and 17,076 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, compared with 17,503 at December 31, 2019.

The Company provides pension and other postretirement benefits for its employees, including pension, retirement savings and post-retirement benefit plans. Expenses related to such benefits totaled $128 million in 2021, $118 million in 2020 and $76 million in 2019. The amounts recorded in salaries and employee benefits expense and other costs of operations, respectively, from the preceding sentence were as follows: $125 million and $3 million in 2021&#59; $118 million and ($329,000) in 2020&#59; and $98 million and ($22) million in 2019. The Company sponsors both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. Pension benefit expense for those plans was $68 million in 2021, $60 million in 2020 and $31 million in 2019. Components of pension expense include the amortization of net unrecognized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Such net unrecognized gains and losses have generally been amortized over the average remaining service periods of active participants in the plan. If all or substantially all of the plan&#8217;s participants are inactive, GAAP provides for the average remaining life expectancy of the participants to be used instead of average remaining service periods. Substantially all of the participants in the Company&#8217;s qualified defined benefit pension plan were inactive and, beginning in 2022, the average remaining life expectancy will be utilized prospectively to amortize the net unrecognized gains and losses of the Plan existent at each measurement date. The change is expected to increase the amortization period by approximately sixteen years beginning in 2022 and, accordingly, reduce the amount of amortization of unrecognized losses recorded in the 2022 net periodic pension expense that otherwise would have been recorded by approximately $35 million.

&#160;

Information about the Company&#8217;s pension plans, including significant assumptions utilized in completing actuarial calculations for the plans, is included in note 13 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

The Company&#8217;s retirement savings plan (&#8220;RSP&#8221;) is a defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of the Company may defer up to 50% of qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. RSP expense reflecting the Company&#8217;s employer matching contribution totaled $63 million in 2021, $62 million in 2020 and $48 million in 2019.

Excluding the nonoperating expense items already noted, nonpersonnel operating expenses were $1.51 billion in 2021, $1.42 billion in 2020 and $1.55 billion in 2019. The increase in such expenses in 2021 as compared with 2020 reflects a rise in expenditures for outside data processing and software, FDIC assessments and professional services, partially offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights as compared to an increase in 2020. The decrease in nonpersonnel operating expenses from 2019 to 2020 reflected lower expenditures for professional services, legal-related matters, advertising and marketing, and travel and entertainment. Additionally, a $48 million charge from the 2019 sale of an investment in an asset manager contributed to the higher expenses in 2019. Those factors were partially offset by higher costs for outside data processing and software, increases to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights and $14 million of expenses related to the planned transition of the support for the Company&#8217;s retail brokerage and advisory business to the platform of LPL Financial. During 2019 the Company increased its reserve for legal matters, predominantly related to a subsidiary&#8217;s role as trustee of Employee Stock Ownership Plans in its Institutional Client Services business. The Company made contributions to The M&#38;T Charitable Foundation of $28 million and $8 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no similar contributions in 2019.

&#160;

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $596 million in 2021, $416 million in 2020 and $618 million in 2019. The effective tax rates were 24.3% in each of 2021 and 2019 and 23.5% in 2020. The effective tax rate is affected by the level of income earned that is exempt from tax relative to the overall level of pre-tax income, the level of income allocated to the various state and local jurisdictions where the Company operates, because tax rates differ among such jurisdictions, and the impact of any large discrete or infrequently occurring items. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate in future periods will also be affected by any change in income tax laws or regulations and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the Company&#8217;s interpretations by any of various tax authorities that may examine tax returns filed by M&#38;T or any of its subsidiaries. Information about amounts accrued for uncertain tax positions and a reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income is provided in note 14 of Notes to Financial Statements.

&#160;

International Activities

Assets and revenues associated with international activities represent less than 1% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated assets and revenues. International assets included $197 million and $170 million of loans to foreign borrowers at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the second quarter of 2021, the Company introduced a new interest-bearing sweep product (included in savings and interest-bearing deposits) that replaced the Eurodollar sweep product previously recorded as Cayman Islands office deposits. As a result, there were no outstanding deposits at the Cayman Islands office at December 31, 2021 and the office is closed. Deposits in the Company&#8217;s office in the Cayman Islands aggregated $652 million at December 31, 2020. Loans at M&#38;T Bank&#8217;s commercial banking office in Ontario, Canada included in international assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $153 million and $149 million, respectively. Deposits at that office were $32 million at each of 

&#160;

December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 . The Company also offers trust-related services in Europe. Revenues from providing such services during 2021 , 2020 and 2019 were approximately $38 million, $36 million and $32 million, respectively. 

&#160;

&#160;

Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity

As a financial intermediary, the Company is exposed to various risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Company&#8217;s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.

The most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits, which are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That customer base has, over the past several years, become more geographically diverse as a result of expansion of the Company&#8217;s businesses. Nevertheless, the Company faces competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. Core deposits financed 90% of the Company&#8217;s earning assets at December 31, 2021, compared with 88% at December 31, 2020 and 83% at December 31, 2019.

The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including overnight federal funds purchased, short-term advances from the FHLB of New York, brokered deposits and longer-term borrowings. At December 31, 2021, M&#38;T Bank had short-term and long-term credit facilities with the FHLBs aggregating $16.2 billion. Outstanding borrowings under FHLB credit facilities totaled $2 million at each of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Such borrowings were secured by loans and investment securities. M&#38;T Bank had an available line of credit with the FRB of New York that totaled approximately $13.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The amount of that line is dependent upon the balances of loans and securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings outstanding under such line of credit at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Senior notes issued and outstanding totaled $2.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2020. On January 25, 2021, $350 million of variable rate senior notes of M&#38;T Bank matured. In addition, on March 1, 2021, M&#38;T Bank redeemed $500 million of subordinated notes that were due to mature on December 1, 2021.

The Company has, from time to time, issued subordinated capital notes and junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company&#8217;s junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities have been removed from the definition of Tier 1 capital but, similar to other subordinated capital notes, are considered Tier 2 capital and are includable in total regulatory capital. Information about the Company&#8217;s borrowings is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company has also benefited from the placement of brokered deposits. The Company has brokered savings and interest-bearing checking deposit accounts that aggregated $3.2 billion and $4.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Brokered time deposits were not a significant source of funding as of those dates. 

The Company&#8217;s ability to obtain funding from these sources could be negatively impacted should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of short-term funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets. The Company attempts to quantify such credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade over various grading levels. Such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets. Information about the credit ratings 

&#160;

of M&#38;T and M&#38;T Bank is presented in table 16. Additional information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the Company&#8217;s short-term and long-term borrowings is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash generated from operations, such as fees collected for services.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

Certain customers of the Company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds (&#8220;VRDBs&#8221;). The VRDBs are generally enhanced by letters of credit provided by M&#38;T Bank. M&#38;T Bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the VRDBs and, at its discretion, may from time-to-time own some of the VRDBs while such instruments are remarketed. When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading account assets in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. Nevertheless, M&#38;T Bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the VRDBs. The value of VRDBs in the Company&#8217;s trading account was not material at December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020. The total amount of VRDBs outstanding backed by M&#38;T Bank letters of credit was $662 million and $725 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. M&#38;T Bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds.

##TABLE_END

The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business that require future cash payments. The contractual amounts and timing of those payments as of December 31, 2021 are summarized in table 18. Off-balance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity, including commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate loans. Because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. Table 18 summarizes the Company&#8217;s other commitments as of December 31, 2021 and the timing of the expiration of such commitments.

Amounts exclude discretionary funding commitments to commercial customers of $10.8 billion that the Company has the unconditional right to cancel prior to funding. 

##TABLE_END

&#160;

M&#38;T&#8217;s primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory limitations. Dividends from any bank subsidiary to M&#38;T are limited by the amount of earnings of the subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of that test, at December 31, 2021 approximately $1.6 billion was available for payment of dividends to M&#38;T from banking subsidiaries. M&#38;T also may obtain funding through long-term borrowings. Outstanding senior notes of M&#38;T at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $766 million and $783 million, respectively. Junior subordinated debentures of M&#38;T associated with trust preferred securities outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 totaled $532 million and $528 million, respectively.

Management closely monitors the Company&#8217;s liquidity position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the normal course of business. Management does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long-term, for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either M&#38;T or its subsidiary banks.

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices and/or interest rates of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments. The primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises from the Company&#8217;s core banking activities of lending and deposit-taking, because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Management&#8217;s philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a &#8220;value of equity&#8221; model to supplement the modeling technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a long-term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2021, the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes that were currently in effect was $15.0 billion. In addition, the Company has entered into $8.4 billion of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements. Information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under the heading &#8220;Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities&#8221; and in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company&#8217;s Asset-Liability Committee, which includes members of senior management, monitors the sensitivity of the Company&#8217;s net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios. In modeling changing interest rates, the Company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel (that is, simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve) and non-parallel (that is, allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts) shifts in the yield curve. In utilizing the model, market-implied forward interest rates over the 

&#160;

subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios. The model considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit-gathering activities, as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on- or off-balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes. 

Table 21 displays as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year.

##TABLE_END

The Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgage-related assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non-trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. In the scenarios presented, the Company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelve-month period as compared with the base scenario. In the declining rate scenario, the rate changes may be limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates remain at or above zero on all points of the yield curve. The assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. The sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates increased as of December 31, 2021 as compared with December 31, 2020 due to the low interest rate environment and composition of the Company&#8217;s portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, in particular the increased balance of interest-bearing deposits at banks. 

Table 22 presents cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes. Management believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all 

&#160;

categories of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities equally nor, as assumed in the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the Company is likely to implement.

&#160;

A significant amount of the Company&#8217;s interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities, preferred equity instruments and interest rate swap agreements have contractual repricing terms that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;). Various regulatory bodies have encouraged banks to transition away from LIBOR as soon as practicable, generally cease entering new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate no later than December 31, 2021, and for new contracts entered into before December 31, 2021 to utilize a reference rate other than LIBOR or include robust language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate after LIBOR&#8217;s discontinuation. Certain tenors of LIBOR have ceased publication at December 31, 2021 and complete cessation of LIBOR publication is expected by June 30, 2023. Effective December 31, 2021, the Company has essentially discontinued entering into new LIBOR-based contracts. 

The Company established an enterprise-wide LIBOR transition program in 2019, which includes a LIBOR Transition Office with senior management level leadership and dedicated full-time employee staffing. Progress on the LIBOR transition effort is monitored by executive management as well as the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. At December 31, 2021 the Company had LIBOR-based commercial loans and leases and commercial real estate loans of $37.7 billion and residential mortgage and consumer loans of $1.9 billion outstanding. As of that date, approximately 

&#160;

half of such loans either mature before June 30, 2023 or have been amended to include appropriate alternative language to be effective upon cessation of LIBOR publication. Approximately $979 million of borrowings and $850 million of preferred equity instruments reference LIBOR. The Company&#8217;s interest rate swap agreements primarily reference LIBOR. In October 2020, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. published the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement (&#8220;Supplement&#8221;) and the IBOR Fallback Protocol (&#8220;Protocol&#8221;). The Protocol enables market participants to incorporate certain revisions into their legacy non-cleared derivative trades with other counterparties that also choose to adhere to the Protocol. M&#38;T adhered to the Protocol in November 2020 and is in the process of remediating its interest rate swap transactions with its end-user customers. With respect to the Company&#8217;s cleared interest rate swap agreements that reference LIBOR, clearinghouses have adopted the same relevant Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) benchmark alternatives of the Supplement and Protocol. 

As loans mature and new originations occur a larger percentage of the Company&#8217;s variable-rate loans are expected to reference SOFR or other indexes, including the Bloomberg Short Term Bank Yield Index (&#8220;BSBY&#8221;). At December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $3.6 billion and $55 million of outstanding loan balances that reference SOFR and BSBY, respectively. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021 the Company had $5.0 billion of notional amount of interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of commercial real estate loans, including $3.5 billion of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements that become effective in 2022 and 2023, and notional amounts of $1.0 billion of interest rate contracts in the trading account that are referenced to SOFR. The Company&#8217;s usage of interest rate swap agreements referenced to SOFR or BSBY is expected to increase in response to the discontinuation of LIBOR. The Company continues to work with its customers and other counterparties to remediate LIBOR-based agreements which expire after June 30, 2023 by incorporating alternative language, negotiating new agreements, or other means. The discontinuation of LIBOR and uncertainty relating to the emergence of one or more alternative benchmark indexes to replace LIBOR could materially impact the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk profile and its management thereof. 

In addition to the effect of interest rates, changes in fair value of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets. That impact is most notable on the values assigned to some of the Company&#8217;s investment securities. Information about the fair valuation of investment securities is presented in notes 3 and 21 of Notes to Financial Statements.

The Company engages in limited trading account activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to fund the Company&#8217;s obligations under certain deferred compensation plans. Financial instruments utilized for trading account activities consist predominantly of interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swap agreements, and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading account activities by entering into offsetting trading positions that are also included in the trading account. The fair values of trading account positions associated with interest rate contracts and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts are presented in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. The amounts of gross and net trading account positions, as well as the type of trading account activities conducted by the Company, are subject to a well-defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by management and approved by M&#38;T&#8217;s Board of Directors. However, as with any non-government guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the Company&#8217;s trading account activities.

The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading account purposes totaled $32.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and $37.8 billion at December 31, 2020. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading account purposes were $1.1 billion and $776 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Although the notional amounts of these contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, the unsettled 

&#160;

fair values of all financial instruments used for trading account activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of all trading account assets and liabilities were $468 million and $83 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021 and $1.1 billion and $117 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020. The fair value asset and liability amounts at December 31, 2021 have been reduced by contractual settlements of $54 million and $305 million, respectively, and at December 31, 2020 by contractual settlements of $6 million and $806 million, respectively. The lower balance of trading account assets at December 31, 2021 as compared with 2020 was largely the result of decreased values associated with interest rate swap agreements entered into with commercial customers that are not subject to periodic variation margin settlement payments. Included in trading account assets at each of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $21 million of assets related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the fair values of such assets are recorded as &#8220;trading account and foreign exchange gains&#8221; in the consolidated statement of income. Included in &#8220;other liabilities&#8221; in the consolidated balance sheet at each of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $24 million of liabilities related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in &#8220;other costs of operations&#8221; in the consolidated statement of income. Also included in trading account assets were investments in mutual funds and other assets that the Company was required to hold under terms of certain non-qualified supplemental retirement and other benefit plans that were assumed by the Company in various acquisitions. Those assets totaled $29 million at each of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Given the Company&#8217;s policies, limits and positions, management believes that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk associated with trading account activities was not material, however, as previously noted, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to transactions related to the Company&#8217;s trading account activities. Additional information about the Company&#8217;s use of derivative financial instruments in its trading account activities is included in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.

&#160;

Capital

Shareholders&#8217; equity was $17.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and represented 11.54% of total assets, compared with $16.2 billion or 11.35% at December 31, 2020 and $15.7 billion or 13.11% at December 31, 2019.

Included in shareholders&#8217; equity was preferred stock with financial statement carrying values of $1.75 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with $1.25 billion at each of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. On August 17, 2021, M&#38;T issued 50,000 shares of Series I Perpetual Fixed-Rate Reset Non-cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 and liquidation preference of $10,000 per share. Through August 31, 2026 holders of the Series I preferred stock are entitled to receive, only when, as and if declared by M&#38;T&#8217;s Board of Directors, non-cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of 3.5%, payable semiannually in arrears. Subsequent to August 31, 2026 holders will be entitled to receive, only when, as and if declared by M&#38;T&#8217;s Board of Directors, non-cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of the five-year U.S. Treasury Rate plus 2.679%, payable semiannually in arrears. The Series I preferred stock may be redeemed at M&#38;T&#8217;s option, in whole or in part, on any dividend payment date on or after September 1, 2026 or, in whole but not in part, at any time within 90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event whereby the full liquidation value of the shares no longer qualifies as &#8220;additional Tier 1 capital&#8221;. On July 30, 2019, M&#38;T issued 40,000 shares of Series G Perpetual Fixed-Rate Reset Non-cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share and liquidation preference of $10,000 per share. Through July 31, 2024 holders of the Series G preferred stock are entitled to receive, only when, as and if declared by M&#38;T&#8217;s Board of Directors, non-cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of 5.0%, payable semiannually in arrears. Subsequent to July 31, 2024 holders will be entitled to receive, only when, as and if declared by M&#38;T&#8217;s Board of Directors, non-cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of the five-year U.S. 

&#160;

Treasury Rate plus 3.174%, payable semiannually in arrears. The Series G preferred stock may be redeemed at M&#38;T&#8217;s option, in whole or in part, on any dividend payment date on or after August 1, 2024 or, in whole but not in part, at any time within 90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event whereby the full liquidation value of the shares no longer qualifies as &#8220;additional Tier 1 capital.&#8221; On August 30, 2019 M&#38;T redeemed the 230,000 shares of the Series A and 151,500 shares of the Series C Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, $1,000 liquidation preference per share, having received the approval of the Federal Reserve to redeem such shares after issuing the Series G preferred stock. Further information concerning M&#38;T&#8217;s preferred stock can be found in note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

Common shareholders&#8217; equity totaled $16.2 billion, or $125.51 per share, at December 31, 2021, compared with $14.9 billion, or $116.39 per share, at December 31, 2020 and $14.5 billion, or $110.78 per share, at December 31, 2019. Tangible equity per common share, which excludes goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets and applicable deferred tax balances, was $89.80 at December 31, 2021, compared with $80.52 and $75.44 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company&#8217;s ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets was 7.68% at December 31, 2021, compared with 7.49% and 8.55% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Reconciliations of total common shareholders&#8217; equity and tangible common equity and total assets and tangible assets as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are presented in table 2. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the ratio of average total shareholders&#8217; equity to average total assets was 11.08%, 11.80% and 13.14%, respectively. The ratio of average common shareholders&#8217; equity to average total assets was 10.13%, 10.88% and 12.08% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Shareholders&#8217; equity reflects accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which includes the net after-tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale, remaining unrealized losses on held-to-maturity securities transferred from available for sale that have not yet been amortized, gains or losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments and adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Net unrealized gains on investment securities reflected in shareholders&#8217; equity, net of applicable tax effect, were $78 million, or $.60 per common share, at December 31, 2021, $145 million, or $1.13 per common share, at December 31, 2020, and $37 million, or $.29 per common share, at December 31, 2019 . Changes in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities are predominantly reflective of the impact of changes in interest rates on the values of such securities. Information about unrealized gains and losses as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 is included in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Reflected in the carrying amount of available-for-sale investment securities at December 31, 2021 were pre-tax effect unrealized gains of $115 million on securities with an amortized cost of $3.1 billion and pre-tax effect unrealized losses of $9 million on securities with an amortized cost of $709 million. Information concerning the Company&#8217;s fair valuations of investment securities is provided in notes 3 and 21 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Each reporting period the Company reviews its available-for-sale investment securities for declines in value that might be indicative of credit-related losses through an analysis of the creditworthiness of the issuer or the credit performance of the underlying collateral supporting the bond. If the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a debt security a credit loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. A loss is also recognized if the Company intends to sell a bond or it more likely than not will be required to sell a bond before recovery of the amortized cost basis.

As of December 31, 2021, based on a review of each of the securities in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio, the Company concluded that it expected to realize the amortized cost basis of each security. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not intend to sell nor is it anticipated that it would be required to sell any securities for which fair value was less than the 

&#160;

amortized cost basis of the security. The Company intends to continue to closely monitor the performance of its securities because changes in their underlying credit performance or other events could cause the amortized cost basis of those securities to become uncollectable. 

On January 1, 2020 the Company adopted amended accounting guidance that requires investment securities held to maturity to be presented at their net carrying value that is expected to be collected over their contractual term. The Company estimated no material allowance for credit losses for its investment securities classified as held-to-maturity at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 as the substantial majority of such investment securities were obligations backed by the U.S. government or its agencies. The Company assessed the potential for expected credit losses on privately issued mortgage-backed securities in the held-to-maturity portfolio by performing internal modeling to estimate bond-specific cash flows considering recent performance of the mortgage loan collateral and utilizing assumptions about future defaults and loss severity. These bond-specific cash flows also reflect the placement of the bond in the overall securitization structure and the remaining subordination levels. In total, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had in its held-to-maturity portfolio privately issued mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost basis of $62 million and $77 million, respectively, and a fair value of $57 million and $70 million, respectively. At December 31, 2021, 81% of the mortgage-backed securities were in the most senior tranche of the securitization structure. The mortgage-backed securities are generally collateralized by residential and small-balance commercial real estate loans originated between 2004 and 2008. After considering the repayment structure and estimated future collateral cash flows of each individual bond, the Company has concluded that as of December 31, 2021, it expected to recover the amortized cost basis of those privately issued mortgage-backed securities. Nevertheless, it is possible that adverse changes in the estimated future performance of mortgage loan collateral underlying such securities could impact the Company&#8217;s conclusions.

Adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, net of applicable tax effect, reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by $267 million, or $2.08 per common share, at December 31, 2021, $481 million, or $3.75 per common share, at December 31, 2020 and $342 million, or $2.62 per common share, at December 31, 2019. Information about the funded status of the Company&#8217;s pension and other postretirement benefit plans is included in note 13 of Notes to Financial Statements.

On January 20, 2021, M&#38;T&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase plan to repurchase up to $800 million of shares of M&#38;T&#8217;s common stock subject to all applicable regulatory limitations. There were no repurchases pursuant to that authorization during 2021. Pursuant to previously approved capital plans and authorizations by M&#38;T&#8217;s Board of Directors, M&#38;T repurchased 2,577,000 common shares for $374 million in 2020 and 8,257,000 common shares for $1.3 billion during 2019. 

During the fourth quarter of 2021, M&#38;T&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $1.20 per common share from the previous rate of $1.10 per common share. During 2019, M&#38;T&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $1.10 per common share in the fourth quarter from the previous rate of $1.00 per common share. Cash dividends declared on M&#38;T&#8217;s common stock totaled $584 million in 2021, compared with $569 million and $552 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Dividends per common share totaled $4.50 in 2021, compared with $4.40 and $4.10 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Dividends of $73 million in 2021, $68 million in 2020 and $72 million in 2019 were declared on preferred stock in accordance with the terms of each series. 

&#160;

M&#38;T and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal banking agencies. Pursuant to those regulations, the minimum capital ratios are as follows: 

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

4.5% Common Equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) to risk-weighted assets (each as defined in the capital regulations)&#59; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets (each as defined in the capital regulations)&#59; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets (each as defined in the capital regulations)&#59; and 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the &#8220;leverage ratio&#8221;), as defined in the capital regulations. 

##TABLE_END

Capital regulations require buffers in addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratios noted above. M&#38;T is subject to a stress capital buffer requirement that is determined through the Federal Reserve&#8217;s supervisory stress tests and M&#38;T&#8217;s bank subsidiaries are subject to a capital conservation buffer requirement. The buffer requirement for each entity is currently 2.5% of risk-weighted assets and must be composed entirely of CET1. The federal bank regulatory agencies have issued rules that allow banks and bank holding companies to phase-in the impact of adopting the expected credit loss accounting model on regulatory capital. Those rules allow banks and bank holding companies to delay for two years the day one impact on retained earnings of adopting the expected loss accounting standard and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses subsequent to the initial adoption, followed by a three-year transition period. M&#38;T and its subsidiary banks adopted these rules and the impact is reflected in regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2021. The regulatory capital amounts and ratios of M&#38;T and its bank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021 are presented in note 24 of Notes to Financial Statements. A detailed discussion of the regulatory capital rules is included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Capital Requirements.&#8221;

The Company is subject to the comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to bank and financial holding companies and their subsidiaries, which includes examinations by a number of regulators. Regulation of financial institutions such as M&#38;T and its subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC and the banking and financial system as a whole, and generally is not intended for the protection of shareholders, investors or creditors other than insured depositors. Changes in laws, regulations and regulatory policies applicable to the Company&#8217;s operations can increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive environment in which the Company operates, all of which could have a material effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and in M&#38;T&#8217;s ability to pay dividends. For additional information concerning this comprehensive regulatory framework, refer to Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K. 

Fourth Quarter Results

Net income in the fourth quarter of 2021 was $458 million, compared with $471 million in the year-earlier quarter. Diluted and basic earnings per common share were each $3.37 in the final 2021 quarter, compared with diluted and basic earnings per common share of $3.52 in the corresponding quarter of 2020. The annualized rates of return on average assets and average common shareholders&#8217; equity for the final quarter of 2021 were 1.15% and 10.91%, respectively, compared with 1.30% and 12.07%, respectively, in the corresponding quarter of 2020.

Net operating income during 2021&#8217;s fourth quarter was $475 million, compared with $473 million in the year-earlier quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $3.50 and $3.54 in the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. The annualized net operating returns on 

&#160;

average tangible assets and average tangible common equity in the final three months of 2021 were 1.23% and 15.98%, respectively, compared with 1.35% and 17.53%, respectively, in the similar 2020 period. Reconciliations of GAAP results with non-GAAP results for the quarterly periods of 2021 and 2020 are provided in table 24. 

Taxable-equivalent net interest income aggregated $937 million in the final quarter of 2021, compared with $993 million in the year-earlier period. That decline was attributable to lower average outstanding loan balances and a reduced net interest margin. Reflecting the impact of persistently low market interest rates and increased holdings of low-yielding balances at the FRB of New York, the net interest margin narrowed 42 basis points to 2.58% in the fourth quarter of 2021 from 3.00% in the final three months of 2020. A verage earning assets were $131.9 billion in the final quarter of 2020 and $144.4 billion in 2021&#8217;s fourth quarter. The $12.5 billion increase in average earning assets was driven by a $22.1 billion rise in low-yielding deposit balances at the FRB of New York and other banks, partially offset by a $5.4 billion reduction in average outstanding loans. Average balances of commercial loans and leases were $22.3 billion in the recent quarter, down $5.4 billion or 19% from $27.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. That decline was largely the result of decreased average balances of PPP loans, due to loan forgiveness by the Small Business Administration, lower dealer floor plan balances, reflecting automobile production and inventory issues experienced by the industry, and subdued loan demand by commercial customers, in general. PPP loans averaged $1.6 billion in 2021&#8217;s final quarter, compared with $6.2 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Average commercial real estate loan balances aggregated $36.7 billion in the final quarter of 2021, down $990 million or 3% from $37.7 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Included in those totals were average balances of loans held for sale of $535 million in the final three months of 2021, compared with $307 million in the corresponding period of 2020. Average residential real estate loan balances decreased $471 million to $16.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 from $16.8 billion in the year-earlier quarter, reflecting ongoing repayments of loans obtained in the acquisition of Hudson City. Also contributing to the decrease were loans held for sale that averaged $485 million and $645 million in the final quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. Consumer loans averaged $17.9 billion in the last three months of 2021, $1.4 billion or 9% higher than in the year-earlier quarter. That increase resulted from a rise in average balances of recreational finance loans of $1.0 billion and automobile loans of $624 million. The net interest spread narrowed in the fourth quarter of 2021 to 2.52%, down 38 basis points from 2.90% in the corresponding quarter of 2020. The yield on earning assets in the last three months of 2021 was 2.64%, down 51 basis points from the year-earlier quarter. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities in the 2021&#8217;s final quarter was .12%, down 13 basis points from .25% in the similar quarter of 2020. The contribution of net interest-free funds to the Company&#8217;s net interest margin was .06% and .10% in the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. As a result, the Company&#8217;s net interest margin narrowed to 2.58% in the fourth quarter of 2021 from 3.00% in the year-earlier period.

A recapture of provision for credit losses of $15 million was recorded for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, compared with a $75 million provision for credit losses in the year-earlier period. Net loan charge-offs were $31 million in the last three months of 2021, representing an annualized .13% of average loans and leases outstanding, compared with $97 million or .39% during the similar 2020 period. Net charge-offs in the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020 included: net charge-offs of commercial loans of $25 million in 2021 and $67 million in 2020&#59; net recoveries of commercial real estate loans of $7 million in 2021 compared with net charge-offs of $12 million in 2020&#59; net charge-offs of residential real estate loans of $2 million in 2021 and net recoveries of $1 million in 2020&#59; and net charge-offs of consumer loans of $11 million in 2021 and $19 million in 2020.

&#160;

Other income rose to $579 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 from $551 million in the similar 2020 period. The increased level in the recent quarter resulted largely from higher trust income, service charges on deposit accounts and brokerage services income. 

Other expense totaled $928 million during the recent quarter, compared with $845 million in the final quarter of 2020. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be &#8220;nonoperating&#8221; in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $2 million and $3 million during the quarters ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively and merger-related expenses of $21 million in fourth quarter of 2021. No merger-related expenses were incurred in the year-earlier quarter. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $904 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and $842 million in the corresponding 2020 quarter. Factors contributing to the higher level of expenses in the recent quarter as compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 were predominantly related to increased costs for salaries and employee benefits (including higher incentive compensation), outside data processing and software, and professional services. The Company&#8217;s efficiency ratio during the final quarters of 2021 and 2020 was 59.7% and 54.6%, respectively. Table 24 includes a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense and the calculation of the efficiency ratio for each of the quarters of 2021 and 2020.

&#160;

Segment Information 

In accordance with GAAP, the Company&#8217;s reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking. 

The financial information of the Company&#8217;s segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note 23 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial information about the Company&#8217;s segments is presented in note 23 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

The Business Banking segment provides a wide range of services to small businesses and professionals within markets served by the Company through the Company&#8217;s branch network, business banking centers and other delivery channels such as telephone banking, Internet banking and automated teller machines. Services and products offered by this segment include various business loans and leases, including loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, business credit cards, deposit products, and financial services such as cash management, payroll and direct deposit, merchant credit card and letters of credit. Net income of the Business Banking segment aggregated $213 million in 2021, up 34% from $159 million in 2020. Higher net interest income of $56 million, a $15 million decline in the provision for credit losses and higher merchant discount and credit card fees of $12 million in 2021 were partially offset by higher personnel-related costs of $11 million. The higher net interest income reflected a 127 basis point widening of the net interest margin on loans and higher average deposit balances of $3.3 billion, partially offset by a 57 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits. The widening margin on loans resulted from a higher level of PPP fee income resulting from the forgiveness of loans by the SBA. The increase in average deposits resulted from a continued desire by the customers of the Business Banking segment 

&#160;

to maintain liquidity during the pandemic and amid the low interest rate environment. This segment recorded net income of $168 million in 2019. The 6% decline in 2020 as compared with 2019 resulted from a $10 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts, a $9 million increase in the provision for credit losses, due largely to higher net charge-offs, and higher personnel-related costs of $7 million. Those unfavorable factors were partially offset by an $11 million increase in net interest income. The growth in net interest income reflected an increase in average outstanding deposit and loan balances of $3.0 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, partially offset by a narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits and loans of 89 basis points and 17 basis points, respectively. 

The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products and banking services for middle-market and large commercial customers, mainly within the markets served by the Company. Services provided by this segment include commercial lending and leasing, letters of credit, deposit products, and cash management services. The Commercial Banking segment recorded net income of $494 million in 2021, compared with $508 million in 2020. The most significant factors contributing to the 3% decline in net income from 2020 to 2021 included a higher provision for credit losses of $28 million, an increase of $13 million in centrally allocated costs associated with data processing, risk management and other support services provided to the Commercial Banking segment, and a $10 million decrease in net interest income. The impact of those items on net income was partially offset by higher letter of credit and other credit-related fees of $22 million and higher merchant discount and credit card fees of $13 million. The decrease in net interest income reflected lower average outstanding loan balances of $1.8 billion and a 52 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits offset, in part, by a widening of the net interest margin on loans of 22 basis points and higher average deposit balances of $5.4 billion. Net income for the Commercial Banking segment totaled $520 million in 2019. The decline in net income in 2020 from 2019 was predominantly driven by a $48 million increase in the provision for credit losses, due to higher loan balances and net charge-offs, and a $9 million write-down of equipment in 2020 that was leased to customers. Offsetting the noted unfavorable factors were a $35 million increase in net interest income and an $11 million decrease in centrally-allocated costs associated with data processing, risk management and other support services provided to the Commercial Banking segment. The increased net interest income reflected higher average outstanding deposit and loan balances of $6.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, partially offset by an 84 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits.

The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit services to its customers. Commercial real estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily buildings, office, retail and industrial space or other types of collateral. Activities of this segment also include the origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans through the Fannie Mae DUS program and other programs. Commercial real estate loans held for sale are included in this segment. Net income for the Commercial Real Estate segment was $372 million in 2021, compared with $382 million in 2020. The $10 million, or 2%, decrease was primarily attributable to a $30 million decline in net interest income, reflecting a 58 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits and lower average loan balances of $237 million. Additionally, lower trading account and foreign exchange gains of $12 million, resulting from decreased activity related to interest rate swap agreements executed on behalf of commercial customers, a $7 million increase in the amortization of capitalized commercial mortgage servicing rights, a $7 million increase in centrally-allocated costs associated with data processing, risk management and other support services provided to the Commercial Real Estate segment and higher FDIC assessments and salaries and employee benefits of $6 million each were partially offset by a $40 million decrease in the provision for credit losses and a $17 million increase in commercial mortgage servicing income. Net income for this segment decreased 21% in 2020 from $486 million in 2019. That decline resulted from a $106 million rise in the provision for 

&#160;

credit losses, due to higher loan balances and net charge-offs, a decline in net interest income of $19 million, higher salaries and employee benefits expense of $11 million, largely reflecting increased incentive compensation costs, and lower trading account and foreign exchange gains of $9 million, resulting from decreased activity related to interest rate swap agreements executed on behalf of customers. Partially offsetting those unfavorable factors was a $10 million rise in commercial mortgage banking revenues, due in part to wider margins on loans originated for sale. The lower net interest income was largely attributable to a narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits and loans of 76 basis points and 14 basis points, respectively, partially offset by higher average outstanding loan balances of $1.7 billion. 

The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and trading account securities, residential real estate loans and other assets, short-term and long-term borrowed funds, brokered deposits, and, through June 2021, Cayman Islands office deposits. This segment also provides foreign exchange services to customers. Net income of the Discretionary Portfolio segment aggregated $289 million in 2021 and $327 million in 2020. The 12% decline in the 2021&#8217;s net income as compared with 2020 reflects a $21 million increase in intersegment fees related to the transfer of residential mortgage loans to the Discretionary Portfolio segment from the Residential Mortgage Banking segment, a $12 million decrease in the value of marketable equity securities, and an $8 million increase in centrally-allocated costs associated with data processing, risk management and other support services provided to the Discretionary Portfolio segment. The Discretionary Portfolio segment recorded net income $144 million in 2019. The significant increase to $327 million in 2020 was driven by a $277 million rise in net interest income, reflecting additional income from interest rate swap agreements utilized as part of the Company&#8217;s management of interest rate risk. Partially offsetting that factor were valuation losses associated with marketable equity securities (compared with gains in the 2019 period) representing a change of $25 million.

The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential mortgage loans and sells substantially all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or to the Discretionary Portfolio segment. The Company periodically purchases the rights to service loans and also sub-services residential real estate loans for others. Residential real estate loans held for sale are included in this segment. Income for the Residential Mortgage Banking segment increased 29% to $173 million in 2021 from $134 million in 2020. That year-over-year increase was attributable to higher net interest income of $40 million, reflecting higher average loan balances of $1.3 billion, and increased revenues associated with servicing and sub-servicing residential real estate loans (including intersegment revenues) of $9 million. The Residential Mortgage Banking segment&#8217;s net income rose 85% to $134 million in 2020 from $72 million in 2019. That improvement resulted from a $131 million increase in revenues associated with mortgage origination and sales activities (including intersegment revenues) and higher net interest income of $33 million, reflecting higher average outstanding balances of deposits and loans of $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. Offsetting those favorable factors were higher servicing-related costs (including intersegment costs and changes to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights) of $37 million, higher personnel-related costs of $22 million, reflecting increased headcount and higher commissions, lower revenues of $17 million associated with servicing and sub-servicing residential real estate loans (including intersegment revenues), and a $14 million rise in centrally-allocated costs associated with data processing, risk management and other support services provided to the Residential Mortgage Banking segment.

The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of services to consumers through several delivery channels which include branch offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and Internet banking. The Company has branch offices in New York State, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Credit services offered by this segment include consumer installment loans, automobile and recreational finance loans 

&#160;

(originated both directly and indirectly through dealers), home equity loans and lines of credit, and credit cards. The segment also offers to its customers deposit products, including demand, savings and time accounts, investment products, including mutual funds and annuities and other services. Retail Banking segment net income aggregated $341 million in 2021 compared with $365 million in 2020. Factors contributing to the decline in net income in 2021 included a decrease of $78 million in net interest income and increased centrally-allocated costs, largely associated with data processing, risk management and other support services provided to the Retail Banking segment. The net interest income decline reflected a narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits of 49 basis points, partially offset by higher average outstanding balances of deposits and loans of $5.1 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. The unfavorable factors were partially offset by a $53 million decrease in the provision for credit losses, a $22 million decrease in personnel-related costs (reflecting lower staffing levels), a $20 million rise in service charges on deposit accounts and an $8 million increase in merchant discount and credit card fees. Net income for the Retail Banking segment was $365 million in 2020, down 31% from $528 million in 2019. That decrease was predominantly attributable to a $185 million decline in net interest income, reflecting a 74 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits, partially offset by higher average outstanding deposit and loan balances of $2.4 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, and a $51 million decrease in consumer service charges on deposit accounts. The lower consumer service charges reflect fee waivers and lower transaction activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those unfavorable factors were offset, in part, by a $17 million decrease in advertising and marketing expenses due to reduced activities related to the pandemic and a $14 million decline in the provision for credit losses. 

The &#8220;All Other&#8221; category reflects other activities of the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments. Reflected in this category are the amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets from the acquisitions of financial institutions, distributions from BLG, merger-related expenses related to acquisitions (when incurred) and the net impact of the Company&#8217;s allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with the earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company&#8217;s reportable segments and the provision for credit losses. The &#8220;All Other&#8221; category also includes trust income of the Company that reflects the ICS and WAS business activities. The various components of the &#8220;All Other&#8221; category resulted in a net loss of $24 million and $523 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. As compared with 2020, the lower net loss in 2021 resulted from a $795 million decrease in the provision for credit losses, the favorable impact from the Company&#8217;s allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company&#8217;s reportable segments, and increased trust income. Those favorable factors were partially offset by higher professional services expenses and increased personnel-related costs. The net loss in 2020 as compared with 2019&#8217;s net income of $11 million resulted from a $476 million increase in the provision for credit losses, the unfavorable impact from the Company&#8217;s allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company&#8217;s reportable segments, and a $29 million increase in outside data processing and software costs. Those unfavorable factors were partially offset by a $112 million decrease in professional and other outside services, a $49 million decrease in accruals for legal matters, the impact of a $48 million charge from the sale of an affiliated asset manager during 2019, higher trust income of $29 million, and increased income from BLG of $16 million.
