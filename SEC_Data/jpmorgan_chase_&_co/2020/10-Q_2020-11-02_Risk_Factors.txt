 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

The following discussion supplements the discussion of risk 

factors affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A: 

Risk Factors on pages 6&#8211;28 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K. The discussion of risk factors, as so supplemented, sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is causing significant harm to the global economy and our businesses. 

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic have had, and continue to have, a severe impact on global economic conditions, including: 

&#8226; significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets 

&#8226; disruption of global supply chains 

&#8226; closures of many businesses, leading to loss of revenues and increased unemployment, and 

&#8226; the institution of social distancing and sheltering-in-place requirements in the U.S. and other countries. 

If the pandemic is prolonged, or other diseases emerge that give rise to similar effects, the adverse impact on the global economy could deepen. 

The continuation of the adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic can be expected to have a significant adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s businesses and results of operations, including: 

&#8226; significantly reduced demand for products and services from JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s clients and customers 

&#8226; possible recognition of credit losses and increases in the allowance for credit losses, especially if businesses remain closed, unemployment continues to rise and clients and customers draw on their lines of credit 

&#8226; possible material impacts on the value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets due to market fluctuations 

&#8226; possible downgrades in JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s credit ratings 

&#8226; possible constraints on liquidity and capital, whether due to increases in risk-weighted assets related to supporting client activities or to regulatory actions, and 

&#8226; the possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, sheltering-in-place arrangements, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic. 

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. Those negative effects, including the recognition of charge-offs, may be delayed because of the impact of prior and potential future government stimulus actions or payment assistance provided to clients and customers. In addition, JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s participation directly or on behalf of customers and clients in U.S. government programs designed to support individuals, households and businesses impacted by the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could be 

criticized and subject JPMorgan Chase to increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny, negative publicity or increased exposure to litigation, which could increase its operational, legal and compliance costs and damage its reputation. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in Risk Factors in the 2019 Form 10-K.
