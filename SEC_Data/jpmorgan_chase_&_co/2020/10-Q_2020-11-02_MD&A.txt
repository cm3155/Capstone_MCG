(a) In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based credit card reward costs from marketing expense to be a reduction of card income, with no effect on

net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(b) Reflects the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition provisions that became effective in

the first quarter of 2020. Refer to Regulatory Developments relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 and Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 of this Form
10-Q for additional information. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85-92 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s capital
metrics.

Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the third quarter
of 2020 versus the third quarter of 2019, unless otherwise
specified.

Firmwide overview
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $9.4 billion for the third
quarter of 2020, or $2.92 per share, on net revenue of $29.1
billion. The Firm reported ROE of 15% and ROTCE of 19%. The
Firm's results for the third quarter of 2020 included firmwide legal
expense of $524 million.

• The Firm had net income of $9.4 billion, up 4%.

• Total net revenue was flat. Net interest income was $13.0 billion,

down 9%, predominantly driven by the impact of lower rates
largely offset by higher net interest income in CIB Markets as
well as balance sheet growth. Noninterest revenue was $16.1
billion, up 7%, predominantly driven by higher Investment
Banking fees, Markets revenue, and Credit Adjustments & Other
in the CIB, and higher net investment securities gains in
Corporate.

• Noninterest expense was $16.9 billion, up 3%, primarily driven

by higher legal expense predominantly in CIB and an
impairment on a legacy investment in Corporate, partially offset
by lower marketing expense in CCB.

5

Selected capital-related metrics
• The Firm’s CET1 capital was $198 billion, and the Standardized
and Advanced CET1 ratios were 13.1% and 13.8%, respectively.

• The Firm’s SLR was 7.0%. The SLR reflects the temporary

exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal
Reserve Banks, as required by the Federal Reserve’s interim
final rule issued on April 1, 2020. The Firm’s SLR excluding the
temporary relief was 5.8%.

• The Firm grew TBVPS, ending the third quarter of 2020 at

$63.93, up 6% versus the prior year.

ROTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP
Financial Measures on pages 22-23 for a further discussion of
each of these measures.

• The provision for credit losses was $611 million, down $903

million from the prior year. Net charge-offs of $1.2 billion were
down $191 million from the prior year, predominantly driven by
Card, which reflected lower charge-offs and higher recoveries,
and benefited from the effect of payment assistance and
government stimulus programs. The current quarter included a
net reduction to the allowance for credit losses that was largely
driven by paydowns in the Home Lending portfolio and changes
in wholesale loan balances, partially offset by an addition to the
allowance for the investment securities portfolio due to the
transfer of certain securities from available-for-sale to held-to-
maturity. The prior year included net additions to the allowance
for credit losses across both the Consumer and Wholesale
portfolios.

• The total allowance for credit losses was $33.8 billion at

September 30, 2020. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses
to retained loans coverage ratio of 3.26%, compared with 3.27%
in the second quarter of 2020, and 1.42% in the prior year; the
increase from the prior year was driven by the additions to the
allowance for credit losses and the adoption of CECL.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $11.5 billion at

September 30, 2020, an increase of $1.7 billion from the second
quarter of 2020, driven by customers that have exited COVID-19
payment deferral programs and were 90 or more days past due
in Home Lending in CCB, and downgrades in the wholesale
portfolio across multiple industries on client credit deterioration.
Nonperforming assets increased from $6.0 billion in the prior
year due to downgrades in the wholesale portfolio, as well as
from the adoption of CECL, as the purchased credit deteriorated
loans in the mortgage portfolio became subject to nonaccrual
loan treatment.

• Firmwide average loans of $991 billion were up 1%, largely
reflecting higher loan balances in AWM, as well as loans
originated under the Small Business Administration’s (“SBA”)
Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), offset by lower loan
balances in Home Lending and Card.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.0 trillion were up 30%,

reflecting significant inflows across the Firm, primarily driven by
the COVID-19 pandemic and the related effect of certain
government actions.

• As of September 30, 2020 the Firm had average High Quality

Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of approximately $670 billion and
unencumbered marketable securities with a fair value of
approximately $660 billion, resulting in approximately $1.3 trillion
of liquidity sources. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on
pages 55–59 for additional information.

Outlook
These current expectations are forward-looking statements within
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the current
beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management,
speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q, and are subject to
significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking
Statements on page 92 and Risk Factors on page 201 of this Form
10-Q and pages 6–28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a
further discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties and
the other factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual
results to differ materially because of those risks and uncertainties.
There is no assurance that actual results will be in line with the
outlook set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update
any forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for the remainder of 2020 and
for 2021 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and
U.S. economies, the COVID-19 pandemic, financial markets
activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment,
client and customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative
developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does
business. Each of these factors will affect the performance of the
Firm and its LOBs. The Firm will continue to make appropriate
adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to
ongoing developments in the business, economic, regulatory and
legal environments in which it operates. The outlook information
contained in this Form 10-Q supersedes all outlook information
furnished by the Firm in its periodic reports filed with the SEC prior
to the date of this Form 10-Q.

Firmwide
• On a managed basis, management expects full-year 2020 net
interest income to be approximately $55 billion, and full-year
2021 net interest income to be approximately $54 billion, market
dependent.

• Management expects adjusted expense for the full-year 2020 to

be approximately $66 billion.

Departure of the U.K. from the EU
The Firm continues to execute on its Firmwide Brexit
Implementation program and remains focused on the following key
areas to ensure continuation of service to its EU clients: regulatory
and legal entity readiness; client readiness; and business and
operational readiness.

The Firm is preparing for the possibility that the U.K. will complete
its departure from the EU without having agreed the terms of their
future relationship, which is commonly referred to as “hard Brexit.”
The Firm is therefore preparing to finalize and implement the
various components of its Brexit readiness plan by year-end,
including completion of the relocation of approximately 200 front
office roles from the U.K. to EU locations, and the migration of
remaining EU clients and certain positions to EU entities by the
end of the year. A key factor in that plan will be to secure client
engagement; any delays may impact the Firm’s ability to continue
servicing EU clients, as the Firm’s U.K.-based legal entities are
expected to lose their ability to transact business from the U.K.
with EU clients at the end of the year.

The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced additional risk to the
Firm’s Brexit Implementation program. Infection rates and travel
restrictions are increasing and lock-downs have been introduced
across various U.K. and EU locations. As a result, the risk that
clients may not be operationally ready and that the Firm may not
be able to relocate employees by year-end is rising. Unless some
official-sector solution is forthcoming, the Firm’s ability to continue
servicing EU clients may be adversely affected.

Business Developments
COVID-19 Pandemic
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm has
implemented strategies and procedures designed to help it
respond to increased market volatility, client demand for credit and
liquidity, distress in certain industries/sectors and the ongoing
impacts to consumers and businesses.

The Firm remains focused on serving its customers, clients and
communities, as well as the well-being of its employees during the
COVID-19 pandemic. The Firm continues to actively monitor the
dynamic health and safety situations at local and regional levels,
and plans remain flexible to adapt as these situations evolve.

Supporting clients and customers
Since March 2020 the Firm has provided assistance to clients and
customers primarily in the form of payment deferrals on loans and
auto leases.

Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 60-61 for information on
assistance granted to customers and clients. Refer to Consumer
Credit portfolio on pages 62-66 and Wholesale Credit Portfolio on
pages 67-76 for information on retained loans under payment
deferral.

The Firm has gradually re-opened its branches since April, with
nearly 90% of its branches returning to full service as of the third
quarter of 2020. Additionally, the Firm continues to make a wide
range of banking services accessible to clients and customers
through mobile and other digital channels.

Protecting and supporting employees
At the onset of the pandemic, the Firm implemented alternative
work arrangements, with the vast majority of its global workforce
working from home.

While the majority of the Firm’s employees globally continue to
work from home, the Firm continues to return employees to the
office.

Supporting communities
Since March, the Firm has committed $250 million to help address
humanitarian needs and long-term economic challenges posed by
the COVID-19 pandemic on the communities in which the Firm
operates. As of September 30, 2020 nearly half of this
commitment has been funded.

Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
On March 12, 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued an accounting standards update providing
optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally
accepted accounting principles to contracts and hedge accounting
relationships affected by reference rate reform. These optional
expedients are intended to simplify the operational impact of
applying U.S. GAAP to transactions impacted by reference rate
reform. The Firm elected to apply certain of these expedients
beginning in the third quarter of 2020. On August 27, 2020, the
International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) issued
guidance that provides similar relief for entities reporting under
International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"). Refer to
Accounting and Reporting Developments on page 91 for additional
information. The Firm continues to monitor the transition relief
being considered by the U.S. Treasury Department regarding the
tax implications of reference rate reform.

The Firm also continues to develop and implement plans to
appropriately mitigate the risks associated with IBOR
discontinuation. Refer to Business Developments on page 47 of
the 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s initiatives to
address the expected discontinuation of the London Interbank
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other IBORs.

Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19
Pandemic

Since March 2020, the U.S. government as well as central banks
and banking authorities around the world have taken and continue
to take actions to help individuals, households and businesses that
have been adversely affected by the economic disruption caused
by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, which was signed
into law on March 27, 2020, provides, among other things, funding
to support loan facilities to assist consumers and businesses. Set
forth below is a summary as of the date of this Form 10-Q of U.S.
government actions currently impacting the Firm and U.S.
government programs in which the Firm is participating to support
individuals, businesses, and the broader economy. The Firm will
continue to assess ongoing developments in government actions
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

U.S. government actions

Eligible retained income definition. On March 17, 2020, the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”),
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”),
collectively the “federal banking agencies,” issued an interim final
rule that revised the definition of “eligible retained income” in the
regulatory capital rules that apply to all U.S. banking
organizations. On March 23, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an
interim final rule that revised the definition of “eligible retained
income” for purposes of the total loss-absorbing capacity (“TLAC”)
buffer requirements that apply to global systemically important
banking organizations. The revised definition of eligible retained
income makes any automatic limitations on payout distributions
that could apply under the agencies’ capital rules or TLAC rule
take effect on a more graduated basis in the event that a banking
organization’s capital, leverage and TLAC ratios were to decline
below regulatory requirements (including buffers). The March 17,
2020 interim final rule was issued, in conjunction with an
interagency statement encouraging banking organizations to use
their capital and liquidity buffers, to further support banking
organizations’ abilities to lend to households and businesses
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 26, 2020, the
federal banking agencies issued the final rule consistent with the
interim final rules published on March 17, 2020 and March 23,
2020.

Reserve requirements. On March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve
reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent, effectively
eliminating the reserve requirement for all depository institutions,
an action that freed up liquidity in the banking system to support
lending to households and businesses.

Refer to Note 21 for additional information on the reduction to the
reserve requirement.

Regulatory Capital - Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”)
transition delay. On March 31, 2020, the federal banking agencies
issued an interim final rule (issued as final on

August 26, 2020) that provided banking organizations with the
option to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two
years, followed by a three-year transition period (“CECL capital
transition provisions”). The Firm elected to apply the CECL capital
transition provisions.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 and Note 22
on pages 177–178 for additional information on the CECL capital
transition provisions and the impact to the Firm’s capital metrics.

Supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) temporary revision. On April
1, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule that
requires, on a temporary basis, the calculation of total leverage
exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR for bank holding
companies, to exclude the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S.
Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. These
exclusions became effective April 1, 2020, and will remain in effect
through March 31, 2021.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 and Note 22
for additional information on the Firm’s SLR.

Loan modifications. On April 7, 2020, the federal banking agencies
along with the National Credit Union Administration, and the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in consultation with the
state financial regulators, issued an interagency statement revising
a March 22, 2020 interagency statement on loan modifications and
the reporting for financial institutions working with customers
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (the “IA Statement”). The IA
Statement reconfirmed that efforts to work with borrowers where
the loans are prudently underwritten, and not considered past due
or carried on nonaccrual status, should not result in the loans
automatically being considered modified in a troubled debt
restructuring (“TDR”) for accounting and financial reporting
purposes, or for purposes of their respective risk-based capital
rules, which would otherwise require financial institutions subject
to the capital rules to hold more capital. The IA Statement also
clarified the interaction between its previous guidance and Section
4013 of the CARES Act, which provides certain financial
institutions with the option to suspend the application of
accounting guidance for TDRs for a limited period of time for loan
modifications made to address the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic.

The Firm has granted various forms of assistance to customers
and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including
payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The majority of the
Firm’s COVID-19 related loan modifications have not been
considered TDRs as:
•

they represent short-term or other insignificant modifications,
whether under the Firm’s regular loan modification
assessments or the IA Statement guidance, or

•

the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the
application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided under
section 4013 of the CARES Act.

11

To the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of the
above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs. Refer to
Credit Portfolio on pages 60-61 and Note 12 for additional
information on the Firm’s loan modification activities.

U.S. government facilities and programs. Beginning in March
2020, the Federal Reserve announced a suite of facilities using its
emergency lending powers under section 13(3) of the Federal
Reserve Act to support the flow of credit to individuals, households
and businesses adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic
and to support the broader economy. In addition, beginning April 3,
2020, the PPP, established by the CARES Act and administered
by the SBA, authorized eligible lenders to provide nonrecourse
loans to eligible borrowers until August 8, 2020 to provide an
incentive for these businesses to keep their workers on their
payroll. The Firm has participated and is participating in certain of
these facilities and programs, as needed, to assist its clients and
customers or to support the broader economy.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54, Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 55–59 and Note 22 for additional
information on the Firm’s participation in these facilities. Refer to
Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54, Credit Portfolio on
pages 60-61 and Note 22 for additional information on the Firm’s
participation in the PPP.

(a) In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fees from asset management, administration and commissions to lending- and deposit-related fees. Prior-period

amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(b) In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based credit card reward costs from marketing expense to be a reduction of card income, with no effect on

net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(c) Included operating lease income of $1.4 billion for each of the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, and $4.2 billion and $4.0 billion for the nine months ended

September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Quarterly results
Investment banking fees increased, driven by CIB, reflecting:

• higher equity underwriting fees primarily in follow-on offerings

and IPO markets due to increased industry-wide fees

• higher debt underwriting fees due to wallet share gains despite

decreased industry-wide fees,

partially offset by

• lower advisory fees driven by a lower number of completed

transactions associated in part with the lower level of announced
deal volumes in the first half of the year.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 31-37 and Note 6 for
additional information.

Principal transactions revenue increased, primarily in CIB,
reflecting:

• higher revenue in both Fixed Income and Equity Markets driven
by strong performance in Commodities and Credit, as well as
Cash Equities, respectively, and

• a $169 million gain in Credit Adjustments & Other largely driven

by funding and credit spread tightening on derivatives,
compared with a $71 million loss in the prior year.

The increase in principal transactions revenue also reflected net
gains on certain legacy private equity investments in Corporate.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases have
offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income.
The Firm assesses its CIB Markets business performance on a
total revenue basis.

Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 31-37 and
pages 46-47, and Note 6 for additional information.

Lending- and deposit-related fees was relatively flat as the lower
deposit-related fees in CCB, reflecting lower transaction activity and
the impact of fee refunds related to the COVID-19 pandemic, was
offset by higher cash management fees, as well as higher lending-
related fees, in particular, loan commitment fees in CIB and CB.
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 26-30, CIB on pages 31-
37 and CB on pages 38-41, respectively, and Note 6 for additional
information.

Asset management, administration and commissions revenue
increased, reflecting higher asset management fees as a result of
cumulative net inflows into liquidity and long-term products in
AWM.

For information on asset management, administration and
commissions revenue, refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment
results on pages 26-30, pages 31-37 and pages 42-45,
respectively, and Note 6.

Investment securities gains increased due to the repositioning of
the investment securities portfolio, including sales of U.S. GSE
and government agency mortgage-backed securities.

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 46-47 and Note 10
for information on investment securities gains.

Year-to-date results
Investment banking fees increased, driven by CIB, reflecting:

• higher equity underwriting fees primarily in follow-on offerings
and convertible securities markets due to increased industry-
wide fees

Mortgage fees and related income increased due to:

• higher debt underwriting fees due to increased industry-wide

fees and wallet share gains in investment-grade and high-yield
bonds. The increased activity resulted in part from clients
seeking liquidity in the first half of the year as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic,

partially offset by

• lower advisory fees driven by a lower number of completed

transactions.

Principal transactions revenue increased, primarily in CIB,
reflecting:

• higher revenue in both Fixed Income and Equity Markets driven

by strong performance in Rates, Currencies & Emerging
Markets, Credit and Commodities, as well as in Cash Equities
and equity derivatives, respectively,

partially offset by

• a $272 million net loss in Credit Adjustments & Other driven by

losses on certain components of fair value option elected
liabilities, as well as the impact of funding spread widening on
derivatives.

The increase in principal transactions revenue also reflected net
gains on certain legacy private equity investments in Corporate,
compared with net losses in the prior year.

Lending- and deposit-related fees was relatively flat as the lower
deposit-related fees in CCB, reflecting lower transaction activity and
the impact of fee refunds related to the COVID-19 pandemic, was
offset by higher cash management fees in CIB and CB, as well as
higher lending-related fees, in particular, loan commitment fees in
CIB.

Asset management, administration and commissions revenue
increased driven by:

• higher asset management fees in AWM as a result of cumulative

net inflows into liquidity and long-term products, and in CCB
related to a higher level of investment assets

• higher brokerage commissions in CIB and AWM on higher client-

driven volume,

partially offset by

• lower volume of annuity sales in CCB.

• higher net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting

– higher MSR risk management results driven by updates to

model inputs, and

– higher operating revenue reflecting the absence of losses in

the prior year from reclassifying certain loans to held-for-sale,
predominantly offset by lower revenue on a lower level of
third-party loans serviced

• higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher
production margins and volumes; the prior year included
approximately $350 million of gains on the sale of certain loans.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 26-30, Note 6 and 15 for
further information.

Card income decreased due to lower net interchange income
reflecting lower card sales volumes as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, largely offset by lower acquisition costs and higher
annual fees.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 26-30, and Note 6 for
further information.

Other income decreased, reflecting:

• net losses related to derivatives in Other Corporate, as well as
the costs of hedging certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated net
investment exposures in Treasury and CIO

• losses related to the early termination of certain of the Firm's

long-term debt in Treasury and CIO

• increased amortization on higher levels of alternative energy

investments in CIB. The increased amortization was more than
offset by lower income tax expense from the associated tax
credits.

Net interest income decreased due to the impact of lower rates,
largely offset by higher net interest income in CIB Markets, as well
as balance sheet growth.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.9 trillion, up
$510 billion, and the yield was 2.05%, down 151 basis points
("bps"), primarily due to lower rates. The net yield on these assets,
on an FTE basis, was 1.82%, a decrease of 59 bps. The net yield
excluding CIB Markets was 2.05%, down 118 bps.

Net yield excluding CIB Markets is a non-GAAP financial measure.
Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and
rates schedule on pages 190–191 for further details; and the
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP
Financial Measures on pages 22-23 for a further discussion of Net
interest yield excluding CIB Markets.

Investment securities gains increased due to the repositioning of
the investment securities portfolio, including sales of U.S. GSE
and government agency mortgage-backed securities in the first
and third quarters of 2020.

Mortgage fees and related income increased due to:

• higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher
mortgage production volumes and margins; the prior year
included gains on the sales of certain loans

• higher net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting

– higher MSR risk management results; the prior year included

Other income decreased reflecting:

• net losses related to derivatives in Other Corporate, as well as
the costs of hedging certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated net
investment exposures in Treasury and CIO

• net losses on certain equity investments in CIB, compared with

net gains in the prior year

• increased amortization on higher levels of alternative energy
investments in CIB. The increased amortization is more than
offset by lower income tax expense from the associated tax
credits

losses resulting from updates to model inputs,

• lower net valuation gains on certain investments in AWM

partially offset by

– lower operating revenue reflecting a lower level of third-party

loans serviced; the prior year included losses from
reclassifying certain loans to held-for-sale.

Card income decreased due to lower net interchange income
reflecting lower card sales volumes that began in March as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher annual fees
and lower acquisition costs.

• losses related to the early termination of certain of the Firm's

long-term debt in Treasury and CIO,

partially offset by

• higher operating lease income from growth in auto operating

lease volume in CCB.

Refer to Note 17 for further information.

Net interest income decreased due to the impact of lower rates,
predominantly offset by higher net interest income in CIB Markets,
as well as balance sheet growth.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.7 trillion, up
$386 billion, and the yield was 2.47%, down 123 bps, primarily due
to lower rates. The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis,
was 2.04%, a decrease of 45 bps. The net yield excluding CIB
Markets was 2.41%, down 93 bps.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related
commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied when determining the
allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Year-to-date results
The provision for credit losses increased primarily driven by the
deterioration and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment
as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in consumer
and wholesale.

The increase in consumer reflected:
• net additions of $8.3 billion to the allowance for credit losses,

consisting of $6.6 billion for Card, $900 million for Home
Lending, $520 million for Auto, and $252 million for Business
Banking,

partially offset by

• lower net charge-offs largely in Card, which reflected higher

recoveries, and in Home Lending, reflecting higher recoveries on
a loan sale in the first quarter of 2020.

The prior year included an $83 million net reduction in the
allowance for credit losses.

The increase in wholesale reflected a net addition of $6.7 billion
to the allowance for credit losses across the LOBs impacting
multiple industry sectors.
The investment securities provision was predominantly driven by
the transfer of certain securities from AFS to HTM.

Quarterly results
The provision for credit losses decreased driven by both the
consumer and wholesale portfolios.

The decrease in consumer reflected:
• a $300 million reduction in the allowance for credit losses in

Home Lending due to paydowns; a $100 million reduction in the
allowance in the Business Banking consumer portfolio, which
was offset by an addition to the allowance in the Business
Banking wholesale portfolio; resulting in no change to CBB’s
overall allowance for credit losses, and

• lower net charge-offs in Card, which reflected lower charge-offs
and higher recoveries, and benefited from the effect of payment
assistance and government stimulus programs.

The prior year included a $138 million net addition to the
allowance for credit losses.

The wholesale provision was a net benefit as a result of
reductions in the allowance for credit losses across CIB, CB and
AWM, driven by changes in loan balances, partially offset by an
addition to the allowance in CCB Business Banking as noted
above. The prior year provision was largely driven by select
Commercial & Industrial ("C&I") client downgrades.

The investment securities provision was predominantly driven by
the transfer of certain securities from available-for-sale ("AFS") to
held-to-maturity ("HTM").
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 26-30, CIB on pages 31-
37, CB on pages 38-41, AWM on pages 42-45, the Allowance for
Credit Losses on pages 77–78, and Note 10 and 13 for additional

losses.

Quarterly results
The effective tax rate decreased due to changes in the level and

local taxes, as well as prior-year adjustments. The decrease was
partially offset by the absence of tax benefits recorded in the prior
year related to the resolution of certain tax audits.

Year-to-date results
The effective tax rate decreased due to changes in the level and
mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, and state and
local taxes, as well as prior-year adjustments and the more
significant effect of certain tax benefits on a lower level of pre-tax
income. The decrease was largely offset by the recognition of $1.0

(a) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans and other assets. Prior-period amounts have been

revised to conform with the current presentation.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks increased
primarily as a result of significant deposit inflows, which also
funded asset growth across the Firm, including in investment
securities and securities purchased under resale agreements.
Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placements of its excess
cash with various central banks, including the Federal Reserve
Banks.
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements increased predominantly as a result of higher
deployment of cash in Treasury and CIO, as well as the impact of
client activity and higher demand for securities to cover short
positions in CIB. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 55–
59 and Note 11 for additional information.
Trading assets increased compared with lower levels at year-end
due to client-driven market-making activities in debt and equity
instruments in CIB Markets, as well as higher derivative
receivables as a result of market movements, also in CIB. Refer to
Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.

Investment securities increased, reflecting net purchases of U.S.
Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS in the
available-for-sale (“AFS”) portfolio, driven by interest rate risk
management activities and cash deployment, partially offset by a
non-cash transfer of $100.5 billion of AFS securities to the held-to-
maturity (“HTM”) portfolio, resulting in a comparable increase in
HTM; the transfer was made for capital management purposes.

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 46-47, Investment
Portfolio Risk Management on page 79, and

Notes 2 and 10 for additional information on Investment securities.

Loans decreased, reflecting:

•

lower loans in Card due to the decline in sales volume that
began in March as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well
as the impact of seasonality; and lower loans in Home Lending
primarily due to paydowns and loan sales, net of originations,

partially offset by

• the impact of the PPP loans in CBB and CB, as well as growth in

wholesale loans and mortgages in AWM.

The allowance for loan losses increased primarily reflecting the
deterioration and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment
as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, consisting of:

• a net $8.3 billion addition in consumer, predominantly in the

credit card and residential real estate portfolios

• a net $5.2 billion addition in wholesale, across the LOBs

impacting multiple industry sectors, and

• a net $4.2 billion addition as a result of the adoption of CECL.

There were also additions to the allowance for lending-related
commitments, which is included in other liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheets, of $1.5 billion related to the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic, and $98 million related to the adoption of
CECL, resulting in total additions to the allowance for credit losses
of $15.0 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, as of September 30,
2020.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 60-79,
and Notes 1, 2, 3, 12 and 13 for a more detailed discussion of
loans and the allowance for loan losses.

Other assets increased reflecting higher cash collateral placed
with central counterparties in CIB. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 55–59 for additional information.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles decreased reflecting
lower MSRs as a result of faster prepayment speeds on lower
rates and the realization of expected cash flows, partially offset by
net additions to the MSRs. Refer to Note 15 for additional
information.

Deposits increased reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs
primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related effect
of certain government actions

• in the wholesale businesses, the inflows principally occurred in
March as clients looked to remain liquid as a result of market
conditions; in general, balances remained elevated through the
third quarter, and

• in CCB, the increase was driven by lower spending and higher

cash balances across both consumer and small business
customers, as well as growth from existing and new accounts.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 55–59 and Notes 2
and 16 for additional information.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements increased reflecting:

• in CIB, higher secured financing of trading assets, partially offset
by a decline in client-driven market-making activities, and the
Firm's nonparticipation in the Federal Reserve's open market
operations, and

• in Treasury and CIO, higher secured financing of AFS

investment securities. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on
pages 55–59 and Note 11 for additional information.

For information on short-term borrowings, refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 55–59 .

Trading liabilities increased as a result of client-driven market-
making activities in CIB, which resulted in higher levels of short
positions predominantly in debt instruments in Fixed Income
Markets, as well as higher derivative payables as a result of
market movements. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional
information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased reflecting
higher client payables related to client-driven activities in CIB.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs increased
primarily reflecting higher levels of Firm-administered multi-seller
conduit commercial paper held by third parties.

Refer to Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements on page 21 and Notes
14 and 23 for further information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan
securitization trusts.

Long-term debt decreased as a result of maturities of FHLB
advances; net maturities of senior debt, which included the early
termination of certain of the Firm's debt; partially offset by an
issuance of subordinated debt, and higher fair value hedge
accounting adjustments related to lower interest rates. The
decrease was also due to a lower level of structured notes in CIB.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 55–59 for additional
information on the Firm’s long-term debt activities.

Stockholders’ equity increased reflecting the combined impact of
net income, capital actions, the adoption of CECL and an increase
in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The
increase in AOCI was driven by net unrealized gains on AFS
securities, and higher valuation of interest rate cash flow hedges.
Refer to page 96 for information on changes in stockholders’
equity, Capital actions on page 53, and Note 20 for additional
information on AOCI.

(a) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected
lending-related positions from trading assets to loans and other assets. Prior-
period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Operating activities
• In 2020, cash used resulted from higher trading assets and other

assets, partially offset by higher trading liabilities, accounts
payable and other liabilities, and net proceeds from loans held
for sale.

• In 2019, cash used primarily resulted from higher trading assets
and securities borrowed, partially offset by increased accounts
payable and other liabilities, trading liabilities, and net proceeds
from loans held-for-sale.

Investing activities
• In 2020, cash used reflected net purchases of investment
securities and higher securities purchased under resale
agreements, partially offset by net proceeds from sales and
securitizations of loans held-for-investment.

• In 2019, cash used resulted from net purchases of investment
securities, partially offset by higher securities purchased under
resale agreements, and net proceeds from sales and
securitizations of loans held-for-investment.

Financing activities
• In 2020, cash provided reflected higher deposits and securities
loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, partially offset by
net payments of long term borrowings.

• In 2019, cash provided resulted from higher deposits and
securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements.

• For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common

stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. On
March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the
Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common equity.
Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large bank
holding companies, including the Firm, to discontinue net share
repurchases through the end of the fourth quarter of 2020.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations that may require
future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are disclosed as off-balance sheet under
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”).

Special-purpose entities
The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities (“SPEs”), which
are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees).

The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative contracts and lending-
related commitments and guarantees.

The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions with SPEs be
conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing.

The table below provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q a discussion of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet arrangements can be
found. Refer to Note 1 for additional information about the Firm’s consolidation policies.

Type of off-balance sheet arrangement

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred to as
“reported” basis; these financial statements appear on pages 93-
97.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, the
Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP financial measures
at the Firmwide and segment level. These non-GAAP measures
include:

• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the overhead ratio,

which include certain reclassifications to present total net
revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-
exempt securities on a basis comparable to taxable investments
and securities (“FTE” basis)

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue less

noninterest expense

• Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB Markets

• Tangible common equity (“TCE”), ROTCE, and TBVPS

• Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained,

excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use Of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on
pages 57–59 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of management’s use of non-GAAP financial measures.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking,
Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset &
Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the products
and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they
reflect the manner in which financial information is currently
evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results
are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and
Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
on pages 22-23 for a definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present each
segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management
reporting process that derives business segment results includes
the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm
periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and
reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further
refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm’s
LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by
the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance.

Revenue sharing
When business segments join efforts to sell products and services
to the Firm’s clients, the participating business segments may
agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue and
expense are generally recognized in the segment responsible for
the related product or service, with allocations to the other
segment(s)

involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these
revenue-sharing agreements.

Business segment capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as
equity. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to
allocate capital are assessed and as a result, the capital allocated
to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page
90 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional
information on business segment capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business
segment reporting methodology on pages 60–61 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of those
methodologies.

Business segment changes
In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm began reporting a Wholesale
Payments business unit within CIB following a realignment of the
Firm’s wholesale payments businesses. The Wholesale Payments
business comprises:

• Merchant Services, which was realigned from CCB to CIB
• Treasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade Finance

was previously reported in Lending in CIB.

In connection with the alignment of Wholesale Payments, the
assets, liabilities and headcount associated with the Merchant
Services business were realigned to CIB from CCB, and the
revenue and expenses of the Merchant Services business are
reported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily on client
relationships. Prior-period amounts have been revised to reflect
this realignment and revised allocation methodology.

In the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services business was realigned from CCB to CIB as part of the Firm’s Wholesale Payments business. Prior-period amounts have
been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(a) In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fees from asset management, administration and commissions to lending- and deposit-related fees. Prior-period

amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(b) In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based credit card reward costs from marketing expense to be a reduction of card income, with no effect on

net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(c) Included depreciation expense on leased assets of $1.0 billion for both of the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, and $3.2 billion and $2.9 billion for nine

months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(d) Included MSR risk management results of $145 million and $53 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $134 million and $(200)

million for nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

26

Quarterly results
Net income was $3.9 billion, a decrease of 9%.
Net revenue was $12.8 billion, a decrease of 9%.
Net interest income was $8.0 billion, down 13%, driven by:
• the impact of deposit margin compression in CBB and lower loans in
Card due to the decline in sales volume as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic,
largely offset by
• growth in deposits in CBB, and loan margin expansion in Card; the

prior year included a charge for the unwind of the internal funding from
Treasury and CIO associated with the sale of certain mortgage loans.

Noninterest revenue was $4.8 billion, flat, reflecting:
• lower deposit-related fees due to lower transaction activity and the

impact of fee refunds related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and
• lower card income due to lower net interchange income reflecting
lower card sales volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,
offset by lower acquisition costs and higher annual fees,

offset by
• higher net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting:

– higher MSR risk management results driven by updates to model

inputs, and

– higher operating revenue reflecting the absence of losses in the

prior year from reclassifying certain loans to held-for-sale,
predominantly offset by lower revenue on a lower level of third-party
loans serviced

• higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher production
margins and volumes; the prior year included approximately $350
million of gains on the sale of certain mortgage loans.

Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes in the value
of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related
income.
Noninterest expense was $6.8 billion, down 4%, driven by lower
marketing expense as a result of lower investments in marketing
campaigns and travel-related benefits.
The provision for credit losses was $794 million, a decrease of $517
million from the prior year, driven by:
• a $300 million reduction in the allowance for credit losses in Home

Lending due to paydowns, and

• lower net charge-offs in Card, which reflected lower charge-offs and

higher recoveries, and benefited from the effect of payment assistance
and government stimulus programs.

The prior year included a $50 million net addition in the allowance for
credit losses.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 60-79 and
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 77–78 for further discussions of
the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

Year-to-date results
Net income was $3.9 billion, a decrease of 69%, predominantly driven
by an increase in the provision for credit losses.
Net revenue was $38.1 billion, a decrease of 7%.
Net interest income was $25.3 billion, down 10%, driven by:
• the impact of deposit margin compression in CBB, and lower loans in

Home Lending predominantly due to prior year loan sales,

partially offset by
• growth in deposits in CBB, and loan margin expansion in Card; the

prior year included charges for the unwind of the internal funding from
Treasury and CIO associated with the sales of certain mortgage loans.

Noninterest revenue was $12.8 billion, flat, reflecting:
• lower deposit-related fees due to lower transaction activity and the

impact of fee refunds related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and
• lower card income due to lower net interchange income reflecting
lower card sales volumes that began in March as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher annual fees and lower
acquisition costs,

offset by
• higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher mortgage

production volumes and margins; the prior year included gains on the
sales of certain mortgage loans

• higher net mortgage servicing revenue driven by

– higher MSR risk management results; the prior year included losses

resulting from updates to model inputs,

partially offset by
– lower operating revenue reflecting a lower level of third-party loans
serviced; the prior year included losses from reclassifying certain
loans to held-for-sale
• higher auto lease volume.
Noninterest expense was $20.5 billion, down 1%, compared to the prior
year, reflecting:
• lower marketing expense as a result of lower investments in marketing

campaigns and travel-related benefits, and

• lower structural expenses, including lower payment processing costs,
largely offset by
• higher volume- and revenue-related expense, including depreciation

on auto lease assets, and investments in the business.

The provision for credit losses was $12.4 billion, an increase of $8.6
billion from the prior year, driven by:
• additions to the allowance for credit losses as a result of the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic, consisting of: $6.6 billion for Card, $900
million for Home Lending, $649 million for CBB, and $560 million for
Auto,

partially offset by
• lower net charge-offs largely in Card, which reflected higher

recoveries, and in Home Lending, reflecting higher recoveries on a
loan sale in the first quarter of 2020.

The prior year included a $150 million net reduction in the allowance for
credit losses.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. The adoption resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans, which are considered purchased
credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans under CECL. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

(a) At September 30, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $1.5 billion of PCD loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized

interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was performing.

(b) At September 30, 2020 and 2019, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $851 million and $1.6
billion, respectively. Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation, refer to footnote (c) below for additional information. These amounts
have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(c) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans. Prior-period amounts have been

revised to conform with the current presentation.

(d) At September 30, 2020, the 30+ day delinquency rates included PCD loans. The rate prior to January 1, 2020 was revised to include the impact of PCI loans.
(e) At September 30, 2020 and 2019, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $1.1 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, that are 30 or more days past

due. Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation, refer to footnote (c) above for additional information. These amounts have been
excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(f) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 62-66 for further
information on consumer payment assistance activity. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past
due, predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent and charged down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to
sell.

(g) At September 30, 2020, included $20.3 billion of loans in Business Banking under the PPP. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does not expect to

realize material credit losses on these loans. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 60-61 for a further discussion of the PPP.

(h) At September 30, 2020, the principal balance of loans in Home Lending, Card and Auto under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic

were $10.2 billion, $368 million and $411 million, respectively. Loans that are performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent. Refer to
Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 62-66 for further information on consumer payment assistance activity.

In the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services business was realigned from CCB to CIB as part of the Firm’s Wholesale Payments business. Prior-period amounts have
been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a) Includes credit valuation adjustments (“CVA”) managed centrally within CIB and funding valuation adjustments (“FVA”) on derivatives and certain components of fair value
option elected liabilities, which are primarily reported in principal transactions revenue. Results are presented net of associated hedging activities and net of CVA and FVA
amounts allocated to Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.

Quarterly results
Net income was $4.3 billion, up 52%.

Net revenue was $11.5 billion, up 21%.

Banking revenue was $3.7 billion, up 6%.
• Investment Banking revenue was $2.1 billion, up 12%,

predominantly driven by higher Investment Banking fees, up 9%,
reflecting higher equity and debt underwriting fees, partially
offset by lower advisory fees. The Firm maintained its #1 ranking
for Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.

– Equity underwriting fees were $732 million, up 42%, primarily
in the follow-on offerings and IPO markets due to increased
industry-wide fees.

– Debt underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, up 5%, driven by
wallet share gains despite decreased industry-wide fees.

– Advisory fees were $428 million, down 15%, driven by a lower
number of completed transactions associated in part with the
lower level of announced deal volumes in the first half of the
year.

• Wholesale Payments revenue was $1.3 billion, down 5%,

predominantly driven by deposit margin compression and a
reporting reclassification for certain expenses which are now
reported as a reduction of revenue in Merchant Services, largely
offset by the impact of higher deposit balances.

• Lending revenue was $333 million, up 32%, predominantly

driven by higher net interest income reflecting overall spread
widening and higher loan balances.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $7.8 billion, up 29%.
Markets revenue was $6.6 billion, up 30%.

• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $4.6 billion, up 29%, driven

by strong performance across products, primarily in
Commodities, Credit, and Securitized Products.

• Equity Markets revenue was $2.0 billion, up 32%, driven by

strong performance across products.

• Securities Services revenue was $1.0 billion, flat compared to
the prior year, as deposit margin compression was offset by
balance growth.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a gain of $169 million, largely
driven by funding and credit spread tightening on derivatives.

Noninterest expense was $5.8 billion, up 5%, predominantly driven
by higher legal expense and volume-related expense, largely
offset by lower revenue-related compensation expense and
structural expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $81 million,
driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses across
multiple sectors, compared with an expense of $92 million in the
prior year.

Year-to-date results
Net income was $11.8 billion, up 30%.

Net revenue was $37.8 billion, up 29%.

Banking revenue was $11.3 billion, up 10%.
• Investment Banking revenue was $6.4 billion, up 18%, driven by
higher Investment Banking fees, up 22%, reflecting higher equity
and debt underwriting fees, partially offset by lower advisory
fees. The Firm maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment
Banking fees, according to Dealogic.

– Equity underwriting fees were $2.0 billion, up 59%, primarily in
follow-on offerings and convertible securities markets due to
increased industry-wide fees.

– Debt underwriting fees were $3.3 billion, up 23%, driven by

increased industry-wide fees and wallet share gains in
investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The increased activity
resulted in part from clients seeking liquidity in the first half of
the year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

32

– Advisory fees of $1.5 billion were down 8%, driven by a lower

• Securities Services revenue was $3.2 billion, up 3%,

number of completed transactions.

• Wholesale payments revenue was $4.0 billion, down 4%,

predominantly driven by a reporting reclassification for certain
expenses which are now reported as a reduction of revenue in
Merchant Services. In addition, the impact of deposit margin
compression was predominantly offset by higher deposit
balances.

• Lending revenue was $953 million, up 24%, predominantly

driven by higher net interest income reflecting overall spread
widening and higher loan balances.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $26.5 billion, up 39%.
Markets revenue was $23.5 billion, up 48%.
• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $16.9 billion, up 54%, driven

by strong client activity across products primarily in Rates,
Credit, Currencies & Emerging Markets, and Securitized
Products.

• Equity Markets revenue was $6.6 billion, up 33%, driven by

strong client activity across products.

predominantly driven by deposit balance and fee growth largely
offset by deposit margin compression.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a net loss of $272 million,
driven by losses on certain components of fair value option
elected liabilities, as well as the impact of funding spread
widening on derivatives.

Noninterest expense was $18.5 billion, up 10%, predominantly
driven by higher revenue-related compensation expense and legal
expense.

The provision for credit losses was $3.3 billion, compared with
$179 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by net
additions to the allowance for credit losses as a result of the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across multiple industry
sectors.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 60-79
and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 77–78 for further
discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit
losses.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes select income statement data for
the Markets businesses. Markets includes both Fixed Income
Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue comprises principal
transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net
interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business
performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across
revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net
interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are

recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7
for a description of the composition of these income statement line
items. Refer to Markets revenue on page 69 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2019 Form 10-K for further information.

For the periods presented below, the predominant source of
principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon
executing new transactions.

CIB Markets had no loss days in the third quarter of 2020 and three loss days for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Loss days represent the number of days for
which CIB Markets, which consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets, posted losses to total net revenue. The loss days determined under this measure differ from
the measure used to determine backtesting gains and losses. Daily backtesting gains and losses include positions in the Firm’s Risk Management value-at-risk (“VaR”) measure
and exclude select components of total net revenue, which may more than offset backtesting gains or losses on a particular day. For more information on daily backtesting gains
and losses, refer to the VaR discussion on pages 80–82.

In the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services business was realigned from CCB to CIB and the revenue and expense of the business is reported across CCB, CIB and CB
based primarily on client relationship. In conjunction with this realignment, treasury services product revenue has been renamed wholesale payments. Prior-period revenue and
expense amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a) In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fees from asset management, administration and commissions (which are included in all other income) to lending-

and deposit-related fees. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(b) Total net revenue included tax-equivalent adjustments from income tax credits related to equity investments in designated community development entities and in entities

established for rehabilitation of historic properties, as well as tax-exempt income related to municipal financing activities of $82 million and $114 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $243 million and $308 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Quarterly results
Net income was $1.1 billion, up 15%.

Net revenue was $2.3 billion, flat compared to the prior year. Net
interest income was $1.5 billion, down 5%, driven by deposit
margin compression, predominantly offset by higher deposit
balances and lending revenue. Noninterest revenue was $761
million, up 14%, driven by higher deposit related fees and
investment banking income.

Noninterest expense was $966 million, up 3%, driven by higher
compensation expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $147 million,
driven by net reductions in the allowance for credit losses across
multiple sectors, compared with an expense of $67 million in the
prior year.

Year-to-date results
Net income was $544 million, down 82%, driven by an increase in
the provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $6.9 billion, down 2%. Net interest income was
$4.7 billion, down 6%, driven by deposit margin compression,
largely offset by higher deposit balances and lending revenue.
Noninterest revenue was $2.2 billion, up 9%, driven by higher
deposit related fees and a gain on a strategic investment. The
increase was partially offset by lower card income primarily due to
lower volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and a $57
million markdown of a held-for-sale position.

Noninterest expense was $2.9 billion, up 2%, driven by higher
compensation expense.

38

The provision for credit losses was $3.3 billion, compared with
$186 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by net
additions to the allowance for credit losses as a result of the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across multiple industry
sectors.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 60-79
and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 77–78 for further
discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit
losses.

CB product revenue consists of the following:
Lending includes a variety of financing alternatives, which are primarily
provided on a secured basis; collateral includes receivables, inventory,
equipment, real estate or other assets. Products include term loans, revolving
lines of credit, bridge financing, asset-based structures, leases, and standby
letters of credit.
Wholesale payments includes revenue from a broad range of products and
services that enable CB clients to manage payments and receipts, as well as
invest and manage funds.
Investment banking includes revenue from a range of products providing CB
clients with sophisticated capital-raising alternatives, as well as balance sheet
and risk management tools through advisory, equity underwriting, and loan
syndications. Revenue from Fixed Income and Equity Markets products used by
CB clients is also included.
Other product revenue primarily includes tax-equivalent adjustments generated
from Community Development Banking activities and certain income derived
from principal transactions.

Quarterly results
Net income was $877 million, up 31%.

Net revenue was $3.7 billion, up 5%. Net interest income of $850
million was relatively flat, as deposit margin compression was
predominantly offset by growth in average deposit and loan
balances. Noninterest revenue was $2.9 billion, up 6%,
predominantly driven by higher asset management fees due to
strong cumulative net inflows into liquidity and long-term products
and increased brokerage commissions on higher client-driven
volume.

Revenue from Asset Management was $1.9 billion, up 6%,
predominantly driven by asset management fees due to strong
cumulative net inflows into liquidity products.

Revenue from Wealth Management was $1.8 billion, up 3%,
predominantly driven by higher deposit and loan balances,
increased brokerage commissions on higher client-driven volume,
and higher asset management fees due to cumulative net inflows
across all products, largely offset by deposit margin compression.

Noninterest expense of $2.6 billion was flat.

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $51 million, driven
by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 60-79
and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 77–78 for further
discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit
losses.

Year-to-date results
Net income was $2.2 billion, an increase of 7%.

Net revenue was $11.0 billion, an increase of 3%. Net interest
income of $2.6 billion, was flat reflecting higher deposit and loan
balances, offset by deposit margin compression. Noninterest
revenue was $8.3 billion, up 4%, predominantly driven by higher
asset management fees as a result of cumulative net inflows into
liquidity and long-term products as well as increased brokerage
commissions on higher client-driven volume, partially offset by net
valuation losses on certain investments, compared with gains in
the prior year.

42

Revenue from Asset Management was $5.4 billion, up 2%, driven
by higher asset management fees as a result of cumulative net
inflows into liquidity products, largely offset by lower investment
valuation gains.

Revenue from Wealth Management was $5.5 billion, up 5%,
predominantly driven by higher deposit and loan balances as well
as increased brokerage commissions on higher client-driven
volume and higher asset management fees, largely offset by
deposit margin compression.

Noninterest expense was $7.8 billion, a decrease of 1%, driven by
lower structural expense, predominantly offset by higher
investments, legal expense and volume- and revenue-related
expense.

The provision for credit losses was $266 million, driven by
additions to the allowance for credit losses predominantly as a
result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

(a) Included tax-equivalent adjustments, driven by tax-exempt income from municipal bonds, of $62 million and $74 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and

2019, respectively, and $186 million and $241 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(b) Included a net legal benefit of $(6) million and $(32) million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $(38) million and $(189) million for

the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Quarterly results
Net loss was $699 million compared with net income of $393
million in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $339 million, down $1.0 billion, driven
by lower net interest income, largely on lower rates, including the
impact of faster prepayments on mortgage-backed securities. The
prior year included income related to the unwind of the internal
funding provided to CCB upon the sale of certain mortgage loans.

Noninterest revenue increased, reflecting:

• higher investment securities gains due to the repositioning of the
investment securities portfolio, including sales of U.S. GSE and
government agency mortgage-backed securities, and

• net gains on certain legacy private equity investments,

largely offset by

• net losses related to derivatives in Other Corporate, as well as
the costs of hedging certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated net
investment exposures in Treasury and CIO, and

46

• losses related to the early termination of certain of the Firm’s

long-term debt in Treasury and CIO.

Noninterest expense of $719 million was up $438 million
predominantly driven by an impairment on a legacy investment.

The provision for credit losses was predominantly driven by the
transfer of certain securities from AFS to HTM.

Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional information on the
investment securities portfolio and the allowance for credit losses.
The current period income tax benefit was driven by the change in
the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal,
and state and local taxes as well as the impact of the Firm’s
estimated full-year expected tax rate relative to the level of year-to-
date pretax income. The prior period included tax benefits related
to the resolution of certain tax audits.

Year-to-date results
Net loss was $1.4 billion compared with net income of $1.5 billion
in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $927 million, compared with income of
$1.4 billion in the prior year driven by lower net interest income on
lower rates. The prior year included income related to the unwind
of the internal funding provided to CCB upon the sale of certain
mortgage loans.

Noninterest revenue increased primarily due to
• higher net investment securities gains due to the repositioning of
the investment securities portfolio, including sales of U.S. GSE
and government agency mortgage-backed securities in the first
and third quarters of 2020, and

• net gains on certain legacy private equity investments,

compared with net losses in the prior year,

largely offset by

• net losses related to derivatives in Other Corporate, as well as
the costs of hedging certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated net
investment exposures in Treasury and CIO, and

• losses related to the early termination of certain of the Firm’s

long-term debt in Treasury and CIO.

Noninterest expense of $1.0 billion was up $288 million driven by
an impairment on a legacy investment, and a lower net legal
benefit, partially offset by lower structural expense.

The provision for credit losses was predominantly driven by the
transfer of certain securities from AFS to HTM.

The current period income tax benefit was predominantly driven by
the change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to
U.S. federal, and state and local taxes. The prior period included
tax benefits of $957 million related to the resolution of certain tax
audits.

Treasury and CIO overview
At September 30, 2020, the average credit rating of the Treasury and CIO investment securities comprising the portfolio in the table below
was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Note 10
for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities.
When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises
customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes
markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm
takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to
manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that
balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and
investors and protects the safety and soundness of the Firm.

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among
other things:

• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and

escalation of risk issues, by all individuals within the Firm;

• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and

management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and

• Firmwide structures for risk governance.

The Firm strives for continual improvement in its efforts to enhance
controls, ongoing employee training and development, talent
retention, and other measures. The Firm follows a disciplined and
balanced compensation framework with strong internal
governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors
(the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive
compensation processes.

Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight framework
involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts
of risks.

Refer to pages 79-83 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a
further discussion of Firmwide risk management governance and
oversight.

48

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and
associated risks during normal economic environments and under
stressed conditions.

Refer to pages 85–92 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form
10-K, Note 22 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory
Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s
website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s Capital Risk
Management, including capital planning and stress testing.

The Firm has been impacted by recent market events as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic, but remains well-capitalized. However,
the continuation or further deterioration of the current
macroeconomic environment could result in impacts to the Firm’s
capital and leverage.

Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios
and overall capital adequacy standards for large and
internationally active U.S. bank holding companies (“BHC”) and
banks, including the Firm and its insured depository institution
(“IDI”) subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The
minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs
and banks is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets
(“RWA”), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet
exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach
(“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based capital ratios,
the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of
the Standardized or Advanced approaches.

The Firm’s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are currently
more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk-based ratios.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approach
banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR.
Refer to SLR on page 90 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K
for additional information.

Key Regulatory Developments
Current Expected Credit Losses. As disclosed in the Firm’s 2019
Form 10-K, the Firm initially elected to phase-in the January 1,
2020 (“day 1”) CECL adoption impact to retained earnings of $2.7
billion to CET1 capital, at 25% per year in each of 2020 to 2023.
As part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,
on March 31, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim
final rule (issued as final on August 26, 2020) that provided the
option to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two
years, followed by a three-year transition period (“CECL capital
transition provisions”).

The final rule provides a uniform approach for estimating the
effects of CECL compared to the legacy incurred loss model
during the first two years of the transition period (the “day 2”
transition amount), whereby the Firm may exclude from CET1
capital 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses
(excluding allowances on PCD loans). The cumulative day 2
transition amount as at December 31, 2021 that is not recognized
in CET1 capital as well as the $2.7 billion day 1 impact, will be
phased into CET1 capital at 25% per year beginning January 1,
2022. The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition
provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended September 30,
2020, the capital metrics of the Firm exclude $6.4 billion, which is
the $2.7 billion day 1 impact to retained earnings and 25% of the
$15.2 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses (excluding
allowances on PCD loans).

The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions on Tier 2
capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage exposure
have also been incorporated into the Firm’s capital metrics. Refer
to Note 1 for further information on the CECL accounting
guidance.

Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility ("MMLF"). On March
18, 2020, the Federal Reserve established the MMLF facility,
authorized through September 30, 2020, to enhance the liquidity
and functioning of money markets. On July 28, 2020, the Federal
Reserve announced that it was extending the MMLF through
December 31, 2020. Under the MMLF, the FRBB makes
nonrecourse advances to participating financial institutions to
purchase certain types of assets from eligible money market
mutual fund clients. These assets, which are reflected in other
assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, are pledged to
the FRBB as collateral. On March 23, 2020, the federal banking
agencies issued an interim final rule (issued as final on September
29, 2020) to neutralize the effects of purchasing assets through
the program on risk-based and leverage-based capital ratios. As of
September 30, 2020, the Firm excluded assets purchased from
money market mutual fund clients pursuant to nonrecourse
advances provided under the MMLF in the amount of $932 million
from its RWA and $2.2 billion from adjusted average assets and
total leverage exposure.

Supplementary leverage ratio temporary revision. On April 1,
2020, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule that
requires, on a temporary basis, the calculation of total leverage
exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR for bank holding
companies, to exclude the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S.
Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. These
exclusions became effective April 1, 2020, and will remain in effect
through March 31, 2021.

On June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued an
interim final rule that provides IDI subsidiaries with an option to
apply this temporary exclusion subject to certain

49

restrictions. As of September 30, 2020, JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. has not elected to apply this exclusion.

Paycheck Protection Program. On April 13, 2020, the federal
banking agencies issued an interim final rule (issued as final on
September 29, 2020) to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of
participating in the PPP on risk-based capital ratios by applying a
zero percent risk weight to loans originated under the program.
Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does
not expect to realize material credit losses on these loans. As of
September 30, 2020, the Firm had approximately $28 billion of
loans under the program.

The rule also provides that if the PPP loan is pledged as collateral
for a non-recourse loan under the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck
Protection Program Lending (“PPPL”) Facility, the PPP loans can
be excluded from leverage-based capital ratios. As of September
30, 2020, the Firm had not participated in the PPPL Facility.

Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19
Pandemic on pages 11-12 for additional information on regulatory
actions and significant financing programs that the U.S.
government and regulators have introduced to address the effects
of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Stress Capital Buffer ("SCB"). On March 4, 2020, the Federal
Reserve issued the final rule introducing the SCB framework

for the Basel III Standardized approach that is designed to more
closely integrate the results of the quantitative assessment in the
annual CCAR with the ongoing minimum capital requirements for
BHCs under the U.S. Basel III rules. The final rule replaces the
static 2.5% CET1 capital conservation buffer in the Standardized
approach with a dynamic institution-specific SCB. The final rule
does not apply to the Advanced approach capital requirements.
The SCB requirement for BHCs will be effective on October 1 of
each year and is expected to remain in effect until September 30
of the following year.

TLAC Holdings rule. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking
agencies issued a final rule prescribing the regulatory capital
treatment for holdings of TLAC debt instruments by certain large
banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. This rule expands the scope of the existing capital
deductions rule around the holdings of capital instruments of
financial institutions to also include TLAC debt instruments issued
by systemically important banking organizations. The rule is
intended to limit interconnectedness within the financial system
and reduce systemic risk. The final rule will become effective on
April 1, 2021.

The following tables present the Firm’s risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced
Approaches. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85–92 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these

Capital planning and stress testing
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
On June 29, 2020, the Firm announced that it had completed the
2020 CCAR stress test process. On August 10, 2020, the Federal
Reserve affirmed the Firm's SCB requirement of 3.3% and the
Firm's minimum Standardized CET1 capital ratio of 11.3% (up
from 10.5%). The SCB requirement became effective on October
1, 2020.

The Federal Reserve has determined that changes in financial
markets or the macroeconomic outlook due to the COVID-19
pandemic could have a material effect on a firm’s risk profile and
financial condition and therefore is requiring all large bank holding
companies, including the Firm, to update and resubmit their capital
plans by November 2, 2020. The Firm anticipates that the Federal
Reserve will disclose firm-specific results under the additional
scenarios before December 31, 2020.
Refer to Key Regulatory Developments on pages 49-50 of this
Form 10-Q and capital planning and stress testing on pages 85-86
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information.

Other capital requirements
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. global
systemically important bank (“GSIB”) top-tier holding companies,
including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC
and eligible long-term debt (“eligible LTD”).
Refer to other capital requirements on page 91 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on TLAC.

The following table presents the TLAC and external long-term debt

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its
contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or that
it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of
funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities. Refer to
pages 93–98 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K and the Firm’s
U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s
website for a further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk
Management.

LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm maintain an amount of
unencumbered HQLA that is sufficient to meet its estimated total
net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of
significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of HQLA held by
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone
100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to
non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported
HQLA. The LCR is required to be a minimum of 100%. Refer to
page 94 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S.
LCR Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and net
cash outflows.

The following table summarizes the Firm’s average LCR for the
three months ended September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and
September 30, 2019 based on the Firm’s interpretation of the
finalized LCR framework.

(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve

Banks.

(b) Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and

sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rule.

(c) HQLA eligible securities may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased

under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment securities on the Firm’s
Consolidated balance sheets.

(d) Excludes average excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not

transferable to non-bank affiliates.

The Firm’s average LCR decreased during the three months ended
September 30, 2020, compared with the three-month period ended
June 30, 2020, due to an increase in net cash outflows largely due
to market activities in the CIB. Liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. increased during the quarter primarily due to growth in
deposits and a reduction in loans. Deposits continued to increase
in the third quarter primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and
the related effect of certain government actions. However, these
increases in excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are
excluded from the Firm’s reported LCR under the LCR rule.

55

The Firm's average LCR was negatively impacted during the three
months ended September 30, 2020, compared with the prior year
period due to a significant increase in deposits impacting both
HQLA and net cash outflows. However, the average net excess
HQLA has increased during the same period, primarily due to an
increase in cash from unsecured long-term debt issuances.

The Firm’s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to
changes in its HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of
ongoing business activity.

Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s HQLA above, the
Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity
securities and fixed income debt securities, that the Firm believes
would be available to raise liquidity. This includes securities
included as part of the excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates, as described
above. The fair value of these securities was approximately $660
billion and $315 billion as of September 30, 2020 and
December 31, 2019, respectively, although the amount of liquidity
that could be raised would be dependent on prevailing market
conditions. The fair value increased compared to December 31,
2019, due to an increase in excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. which was primarily a result of increased deposits as
noted above.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at FHLBs and the
discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of
collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $295
billion and $322 billion as of September 30, 2020 and
December 31, 2019, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes
the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s HQLA or
other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the
Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central banks.
Available borrowing capacity decreased from December 31, 2019
primarily due to lower credit card receivable balances driven by the
COVID-19 pandemic and a decrease in pledged mortgage
collateral as a result of paydown and maturity activity. Although
available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the
Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central
banks as a primary source of liquidity.

NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity requirement for
large banking organizations that is intended to measure the
adequacy of “available” and “required” amounts of stable funding
over a one-year horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking
agencies issued a final NSFR rule under which large banking
organizations such as the Firm will be required to maintain an
NSFR of at least 100% on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule
will become effective on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required
to publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually
beginning in 2023.

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured
funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet
obligations.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of
funding including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding
in the capital markets and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the
primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may also access
funding through short- or long-term secured borrowings, through
the issuance of unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from
the

Parent Company or the Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”).
The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-
term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings,
primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements.
Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s
investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-
term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity
risk characteristics.

Deposits

Average deposits increased for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2020, reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs
primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related effect
of certain government actions. In the wholesale businesses, the
inflows principally occurred in March as clients looked to remain
liquid as a result of market conditions; in general, balances
remained elevated through the third quarter. In CCB, the increase
was driven by lower spending and higher cash balances across
both consumer and small business customers, as well as growth
from existing and new accounts.

Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Business Segment Results
and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 24-47
and pages 18-19, respectively, for further information on deposit
and liability balance trends.

were revised to conform with the current presentation.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm’s
reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of
the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale
operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable
sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered
to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from
customers that maintain operating service relationships with the
Firm.

The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-
to-deposits ratios, and deposits as a percentage of total liabilities,
as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally
more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit
balances, over time. However, during periods of market disruption
those trends could be affected.

JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on preferred stock and common stockholders’ equity.

Short-term funding
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist
of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase.
These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality
securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase increased at September 30, 2020,
compared with December 31, 2019, reflecting in CIB, higher
secured financing of trading assets, partially offset by a decline in
client-driven market-making activities, and the Firm's
nonparticipation in the Federal Reserve's open market operations,
and in Treasury and CIO, higher secured financing of AFS
investment securities.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under
agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to customers’
investment and financing activities, the Firm’s demand for
financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s
liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both
the investment securities and market-making portfolios), and other
market and portfolio factors.

As of September 30, 2020, the Firm participated in the MMLF
government facility. The secured nonrecourse advances under the
MMLF are included in other borrowed

57

funds. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 for
additional information on the MMLF.
The Primary Dealer Credit Facility ("PDCF") was established by the
Federal Reserve on March 20, 2020. Under the PDCF, the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York (“FRBNY”) provides collateralized
financing on a term basis to primary dealers. These financing
transactions were reported as securities sold under agreements to
repurchase. The Firm participated in the PDCF in the first quarter
of 2020, and ceased its participation in May 2020 as the secured
financing market normalized.
The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding consist of
other borrowed funds and issuance of wholesale commercial
paper. The decrease in commercial paper at September 30, 2020,
from December 31, 2019 and for the average three and nine
months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the prior year
period, was due to lower net issuance primarily for short-term
liquidity management. The increase in other borrowed funds at
September 30, 2020 from December 31, 2019 is primarily driven by
an increase in financing activities in CIB Equity Markets.

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides additional sources of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven
primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives
include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets,
tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of both
bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the
IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities
or redemptions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 93–98
and Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit
ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect
on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of
funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and
decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to
lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of
ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and
behavioral factors, which the Firm believes are incorporated in its
liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in
funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other
third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in
credit ratings. Refer to SPEs on page 21, and liquidity risk and
credit-related contingent features in Note 5 for additional
information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the
funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral
agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of September 30, 2020 were as

discussion of the Firm’s Credit and Investment Risk Management
framework.

The effectiveness of the Firm’s actions in helping borrowers
recover and in mitigating the Firm’s credit losses remains
uncertain in light of the unpredictable nature and duration of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Assistance provided in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies,
nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers and
clients who would have otherwise moved into past due or
nonaccrual status. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages
62-66 and Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 67-76 for
information on loan modifications as of September 30, 2020.

In the following tables, reported loans include loans retained (i.e.,
held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale; and certain loans
accounted for at fair value. The following tables do not include
loans which the Firm accounts for at fair value and classifies as
trading assets; refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further information
regarding these loans. Refer to Notes 12, 23, and 5 for additional
information on the Firm’s loans, lending-related commitments and
derivative receivables, including the Firm’s accounting policies.

Refer to Note 10 for information regarding the credit risk inherent
in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio; and refer to Note 11
for information regarding the credit risk inherent in the securities
financing portfolio. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages
62-66 and Note 12 for further discussions of the consumer credit
environment and consumer loans. Refer to Wholesale Credit
Portfolio on pages 67-76 and Note 12 for further discussions of the
wholesale credit environment and wholesale loans.

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or
change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or
loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments,
including consumer credit risk,
wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk. Refer to pages
60-78 for a further discussion of Credit Risk.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO

Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit
profile of a client, counterparty or customer.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting
guidance. The adoption resulted in a change in the accounting for
PCI loans, which are considered PCD loans under CECL. In
conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-
rated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer,
excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio
segment, to align with the methodology applied when determining
the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform
with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further
information.

The Firm has provided various forms of assistance to customers
and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including
payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The majority of the
Firm’s COVID-19 related loan modifications have not been
considered troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) as:

•

•

they represent short-term or other insignificant modifications,
whether under the Firm’s regular loan modification
assessments or the IA Statement guidance, or

the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the
application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided under
section 4013 of the CARES Act.

To the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of the
above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs. The Firm
considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest
associated with all COVID-19 related loan modifications in its
allowance for credit losses. Refer to Business Developments on
pages 9-10 for more information on customer and client assistance
granted. Refer to Notes 12 and 13 for further information on the
Firm’s accounting policies on loan modifications and the allowance
for credit losses.

Paycheck Protection Program
The PPP, established by the CARES Act and implemented by the
SBA, provided the Firm with delegated authority to process and
originate PPP loans until the program closed in early August 2020.
When certain criteria are met, PPP loans are subject to
forgiveness and the Firm will receive payment of the forgiveness
amount from the SBA. PPP loans have a contractual term of two
or five years and provide borrowers with an automatic payment
deferral of principal and interest. Given that PPP loans are
guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does not expect to realize
material credit losses on these loans. PPP processing fees are
deferred and accreted into interest income over the contractual life
of the loans, but may be accelerated upon forgiveness or
prepayment. The impact on interest income related to PPP loans
was not material for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2020.

At September 30, 2020, the Firm had approximately $28 billion of
loans under the PPP, of which $20 billion and $8 billion are in
Consumer and Wholesale, respectively.

excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S.
government agencies of $1.1 billion. Prior-period amount has been revised to
conform with the current presentation, refer to footnote (a) above for additional
information. At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, nonperforming
assets also excluded real estate owned (“REO”) insured by U.S. government
agencies of $10 million and $41 million, respectively. These amounts have been
excluded based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is
generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as
permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions
Examination Council (“FFIEC”).

(g) At September 30, 2020, nonperforming loans included $1.5 billion of PCD loans
on nonaccrual status. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded
PCI loans as the Firm recognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as
each of the pools was performing.

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans, scored auto and business banking
loans, as well as associated lending-related commitments. The Firm’s focus is on serving primarily the prime segment of the consumer credit
market. Refer to Note 12 for further information on consumer loans, as well as the Firm’s nonaccrual and charge-off accounting policies.
Refer to Note 23 for further information on lending-related commitments.

Weakness in the macroeconomic environment driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in an increase in the allowance for
credit losses in the first half of 2020. The continuation or worsening of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the macroeconomic
environment and the extent to which customer assistance and government stimulus efforts are effective could result in further impacts to
credit quality metrics, including delinquencies, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs.

The following table presents consumer credit-related information with respect to the scored credit portfolios held in CCB, AWM, CIB and
Corporate.

(b) At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, excluded operating lease assets of $21.2 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively. These operating lease assets are included

in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 17 for further information.

(c) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(d) At September 30, 2020, included $20.3 billion of loans in Business Banking under the PPP. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does not expect to

realize material credit losses on these loans. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 60-61 for a further discussion of the PPP.

(e) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans. Prior-period amounts have been

revised to conform with the current presentation.
(f) Includes scored mortgage loans held in CCB and CIB.
(g) Credit card, home equity and certain business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available lines of credit for these products. The Firm has not

experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain conditions are met, home
equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as
permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 23 for further information.

(h) Includes billed interest and fees.
(i) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.
(j) At both September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of

$1.1 billion. Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation, refer to footnote (e) above for additional information. These amounts have been
excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on
nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the FFIEC.

(k) At September 30, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $1.5 billion of PCD loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized

interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was performing.

(l) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19

payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent and charged down to the lower of amortized
cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.

(m) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $16.0 billion and $24.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively,

and were $18.2 billion and $18.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the
current presentation, refer to footnote (e) above for additional information. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates.

Consumer assistance
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly in the form of
payment deferrals.

As of September 30, 2020, the Firm had $12.3 billion of loans under payment deferral programs, which represented a decrease of
approximately $16.0 billion from June 30, 2020. During the third quarter of 2020, there were approximately $2.2 billion of new enrollments in
payment deferral programs largely in the residential real estate loan class. Predominantly all borrowers that exited payment deferral
programs are current. The Firm continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to payment deferrals throughout the deferral
period and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers expected
losses of principal and accrued interest on these loans in its allowance for credit losses.

The following table presents information related to the $12.3 billion and $28.3 billion unpaid principal balance of retained loans under
payment deferral programs as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively, and those that have exited payment deferral
programs as of September 30, 2020.

(b) Excludes risk-rated business banking and auto dealer loans held in CCB and auto operating lease assets that were still under payment deferral programs as of September
30, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Auto operating lease asset payment assistance is currently offering one month payment deferral (initially offered three month payment
deferral). Deferrals do not extend the term of the lease and all deferred payments are due at the end of the lease term.
(c)
Includes $3.8 billion and $5.7 billion of loans that were accounted for as TDRs prior to payment deferral as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively.
(d) Represents the unpaid principal balance of retained loans which were still under payment deferral programs, divided by the total unpaid principal balance of the respective

loan classes retained loans.

Of the $12.3 billion of loans still under payment deferral programs as of September 30, 2020, approximately $3.9 billion were accounted for
as TDRs, either because they were accounted for as TDRs prior to payment deferral, or because they did not qualify for or the Firm did not
elect the option to suspend TDR accounting guidance provided under section 4013 of the CARES Act. All or a portion of the remaining $8.4
billion of loans could become TDRs in future periods, depending on the nature and timing of further modifications or payment arrangements
offered to these borrowers. If the remaining $8.4 billion of loans were considered TDRs, the Firm estimates that it would result in an increase
in standardized RWA of as much as $4.1 billion.

Predominantly all borrowers were current upon enrollment in payment deferral programs and are expected to exit payment deferral programs
in a current status, either because no payments are contractually due during the deferral period or because payments originally contractually
due during the deferral period will be modified to be due at maturity upon exit. For those borrowers that are not modified upon exit from
payment deferral programs and are unable to resume making payments in accordance with the contractual terms of their agreements, they
will be placed on nonaccrual status in line with the Firm’s nonaccrual policy, except for credit cards as permitted by regulatory guidance, and
charged off in accordance with the Firm’s charge-off policies. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the Firm’s nonaccrual and
charge-off policies.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loan balances increased from December 31, 2019 due
predominantly to PPP loan originations in Business Banking,
partially offset by lower residential real estate loans, reflecting
paydowns and loan sales.

Residential real estate: The residential real estate portfolio,
including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly
consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.
The portfolio decreased from December 31, 2019 driven by
paydowns and loan sales in Home Lending, largely offset by
originations of prime mortgage loans that have been retained on
the balance sheet. Retained nonaccrual loans increased from
December 31, 2019 due predominantly to the inclusion of PCD
loans, which prior to the adoption of CECL were considered
performing PCI loans and customers that have exited COVID-19
payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due. Net
charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2020 were
higher when compared with the same period in the prior year as
the current quarter included losses associated with the PCD
portfolio, as well as loans charged down to the lower of amortized
cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell
related to certain customers that have exited COVID-19 payment
deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due. Net
recoveries for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were
higher when compared with the same period in the prior year as
the current year benefited from a recovery on a loan sale.

The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was
$25.8 billion at September 30, 2020. This amount included $9.1
billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully
amortizing payments or have been modified and $8.1 billion of
interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030.
The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving
period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material
deterioration in their credit risk profile.

At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the carrying
value of interest-only residential mortgage loans were $24.8 billion
and $22.5 billion, respectively. These loans have an interest-only
payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-
rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically
originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers,
predominantly in AWM. Performance of this portfolio for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2020 was in line with the
performance of the broader residential mortgage portfolio for the
same period.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s residential
mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government
agencies, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The
Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim
payments related to government-insured loans and considers this
exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses.

accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., Federal
Housing Administration (“FHA”), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Rural
Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“RHS”)) are not included in
the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in
accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie
Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to
foreclosure. Refer to Note 14 for additional information about sales of loans in
securitization transactions with Ginnie Mae.

(b) At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, nonaccrual loans included $2.5
billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of TDRs for which the borrowers were less
than 90 days past due. Refer to Note 12 for additional information about loans
modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status.

(c) At September 30, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $1.2 billion of PCD loans. Prior

to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm
recognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was

(d) Amount represents the unpaid principal balance of modified PCI loans at

December 31, 2019, which were moved to retained loans upon the adoption of
CECL.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio predominantly
consists of prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as
well as overdrafts. The portfolio increased when compared with
December 31, 2019, predominantly due to PPP loan originations of
$21.9 billion in Business Banking of which $20.3 billion remained
outstanding at September 30, 2020 as well as from growth in the auto
portfolio from loan originations, partially offset by paydowns and
charge-offs or liquidation of delinquent loans. The scored auto portfolio
net charge-off rates were 0.04% and 0.41% for the three months
ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 0.28% and
0.42% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019,
respectively. Auto charge-offs for the three months ended September
30, 2020 benefited from payment assistance programs and high
vehicle collateral values.

(a) At both September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, nonperforming assets excluded
mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of
$1.1 billion. Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current
presentation, refer to footnote (b) below for additional information. At September 30,
2020, and December 31, 2019, nonperforming assets also excluded REO insured by
U.S. government agencies of $10 million and $41 million, respectively. These amounts
have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(b) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected

lending-related positions from trading assets to loans. Prior-period amounts have been
revised to conform with the current presentation.

(c) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the

COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 payment
deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which were
considered collateral-dependent and charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.

(d) At September 30, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $1.5 billion of PCD loans. Prior to
the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized
interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was performing.
(e) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Credit card
Total credit card loans decreased from December 31, 2019
reflecting a decline in sales volume beginning in March as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of seasonality. The
September 30, 2020 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.57%
and 0.69%, respectively, decreased compared to the
December 31, 2019 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.87%
and 0.95%, respectively. The delinquency rates were positively
impacted by borrowers who received payment assistance and
government stimulus. Net charge-offs decreased for the three
months ended September 30, 2020 compared with the same
period in the prior year reflecting lower charge-offs and higher
recoveries, and benefited from the effect of payment assistance
and government stimulus programs. Net charge-offs decreased for
the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared with the
same period in the prior year reflecting higher recoveries.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically
remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm’s
allowance for loan losses includes the estimated uncollectible
portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to
Note 12 for further information about this portfolio, including
information about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic and FICO
composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.

Modifications of credit card loans
At September 30, 2020 the Firm had $1.4 billion of credit card
loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, which does
not include loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered TDRs, compared to $1.5
billion at December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 12 for additional
information about loan modification programs to borrowers.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk
primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and
hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as
through various operating services (such as cash management and
clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed
with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the
Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that
it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business
and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The
wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting
ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction
structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion
on pages 69-73 for further information.

The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB,
CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated business banking
and auto dealer exposures held in CCB for which the wholesale
methodology is applied when determining the allowance for credit
losses.

The macroeconomic environment, driven by the impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in broad-based credit
deterioration and an increase in the allowance for credit losses. In
the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the investment-grade
percentage of the portfolio decreased from 74% to 71%, and
criticized exposure increased $22.3 billion from $15.1 billion to
$37.4 billion, primarily driven by downgrade activity in the first half of
the year. The increase in criticized exposure was largely driven by
downgrades in Consumer & Retail and Oil & Gas. The continuation
or worsening of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
macroeconomic environment could result in further impacts to credit
quality metrics, including investment-grade percentages, as well as
to criticized and nonperforming exposures and charge-offs.

Lending-related commitments and retained loans increased by
$23.7 billion and $19.2 billion, respectively, in the nine months
ended September 30, 2020, driven by increases across CB, AWM
and CIB, including loans under the PPP. Outstanding loan balances
under committed revolving credit facilities as of September 30, 2020
have returned to near the levels that existed before the increased
drawdown activity in March as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Wholesale assistance
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to clients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly in the form of payment
deferrals and covenant modifications.

As of September 30, 2020, the Firm had approximately $6.3 billion of retained loans still under payment deferral, which has decreased
approximately $10.5 billion from the second quarter, predominantly driven by $8.8 billion of loans to performing auto dealer clients where the
deferral period ended on June 30, 2020. Predominantly all clients coming out of deferral are current, and the Firm has not experienced
significant new payment deferral requests. The remaining deferrals are largely concentrated in Real Estate, predominantly within multifamily
and retail, nearly all of which are scheduled to resume payments in the fourth quarter. The Firm continues to monitor the credit risk
associated with loans subject to deferrals throughout the deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to resume
making regularly scheduled payments and considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest on these loans in its allowance for
credit losses.

In addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of covenant modifications. These types of assistance, both payment deferrals and
covenant modifications, are generally not reported as TDRs, either because the modifications were insignificant or they qualified for the
option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided under section 4013 of the CARES Act. These loans continue
to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit risk management framework. As of September 30, 2020, predominantly all of
these loans were considered performing.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its
industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with
actual or potential credit concerns. Exposures deemed criticized
align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized
exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and
doubtful categories.

Total criticized exposure excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at
fair value, was $37.4 billion at September 30, 2020, compared with
$15.1 billion at December 31, 2019, representing approximately
3.5% and 1.5% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively.
The increase in total criticized exposure was largely driven by
downgrades in Consumer & Retail and Oil & Gas due to impacts
from the COVID-19 pandemic. Predominantly all of the $37.4 billion
was performing and approximately half was undrawn.

Loans
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a variety of
clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to
high-net-worth individuals. Refer to Note 12 for a further
discussion on loans, including information about delinquencies,
loan modifications and other credit quality indicators.

The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan
portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019.
The increase was driven by downgrades across multiple industries
on client credit deterioration, with the largest concentration in Real
Estate, predominantly within retail and lodging.

(a) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option

elected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans. Prior-period
amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

74

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the
Consolidated balance sheets were $76.6 billion and $49.8 billion
at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively, with
increases in CIB resulting from market movements. Derivative
receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after
giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and
cash collateral held by the Firm. However, in management’s view,
the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into
consideration additional liquid securities (primarily U.S.
government and agency securities and other Group of Seven
nations (“G7”) government securities) and other collateral held by
the Firm aggregating $20.4 billion and $16.0 billion at
September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively, that
may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s
exposure is in the Firm’s favor.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7
government securities, other liquid government agency and
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities)
delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as
collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency
and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet
settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not
reduce the balances and is not included in the table above, it is
available as security against potential exposure that could arise
should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the
Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the
Firm’s use of collateral agreements.

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees,
to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual
amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum
possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these
commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these
guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according
to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended,
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total
contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 23 for further
information on wholesale lending-related commitments.

Receivables from Customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin
loans to brokerage clients in CIB and AWM that are collateralized
by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash
on deposit, liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities),
as such generally no allowance for credit losses is held against
these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes
margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on
an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or
other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These
receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts
receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risks
including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest
rates, foreign exchange, equities, and commodities. The Firm
makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and
uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open
risk positions from its market-making activities, including the
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The
Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk
and other market risk exposure. Refer to Note 5 for a further
discussion of derivative contracts.

The following table summarizes the net derivative receivables for
the periods presented.

The following table summarizes the ratings profile of the Firm’s derivative receivables, including credit derivatives, net of collateral, at the
dates indicated. The Firm considers internal ratings equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade. Refer to Note 12 for further
information on internal risk ratings.

As previously noted, the Firm uses collateral agreements to
mitigate counterparty credit risk. The percentage of the Firm’s
over-the-counter derivative contracts subject to collateral
agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are
not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short
maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was
approximately 87% and 90% at September 30, 2020, and
December 31, 2019, respectively.

Credit derivatives
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in
its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user, to
manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with various

As a result of elevated macroeconomic uncertainty beyond the central
case, the Firm continued to place significant weighting on its adverse
scenarios, which incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors
than the central case assumptions outlined above, resulting in
weighted average U.S. unemployment rates, remaining above ten
percent into the fourth quarter of 2021.
Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be
reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods.
Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages
88–90 for further information on the allowance for credit losses and
related management judgments.
Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 62-66, Wholesale Credit
Portfolio on pages 67-76 and Note 12 for additional information on the
consumer and wholesale credit portfolios.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting
guidance. The adoption of this guidance established a single
allowance framework for all financial assets measured at amortized
cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This framework
requires that management’s estimate reflects credit losses over the
instrument’s remaining expected life and considers expected future
changes in macroeconomic conditions. Refer to Note 1 for further
information.
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses comprises:
• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan
portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the
balance sheet,

• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented
on the balance sheet in accounts payable and other liabilities, and

• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which

covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is recognized within
Investment Securities on the balance sheet.

Refer to Note 13 and Note 10 for a description of the policies,
methodologies and judgments used to determine the Firm’s
allowances for credit losses on loans, lending-related commitments,
and investment securities.
The allowance for credit losses increased compared with
December 31, 2019, primarily reflecting the deterioration and
uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, consisting of:
• a net $8.3 billion addition in consumer, predominantly in the credit

card and residential real estate portfolios

• a net $6.7 billion addition in wholesale, across the LOBs impacting

multiple industry sectors, and

• a net $4.3 billion addition as a result of the adoption of CECL.
Discussion of changes in the allowance during 2020
The increase in the allowance for loan losses and lending related
commitments was primarily driven by an increase in the provision for
credit losses, reflecting the deterioration in and uncertainty around the
future macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

–

–

–

In the first quarter of 2020, management’s macroeconomic forecast
included a decline in the U.S. real GDP of approximately 25% and
an increase in the U.S. unemployment rate to above 10%, for the
first half of 2020, followed by a solid recovery in the second half of
2020.
In the second quarter of 2020, based on the increased uncertainty
around the duration and depth of the downturn and speed of
economic recovery, the Firm’s central case assumptions reflected a
more protracted downturn with the slower recovery of U.S. real
GDP.
In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm’s central case assumptions
reflected some near term improvement in economic trends,
however there is elevated uncertainty around potential impacts to
medium and longer term macroeconomic conditions.

77

The adoption of the CECL accounting guidance resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans, which are considered PCD loans under
CECL. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer,
excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied when determining the
allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

(a) Prior to the adoption of CECL, write-offs of PCI loans were recorded against the allowance for loan losses when actual losses for a pool exceeded estimated losses that

were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the time of acquisition. A write-off of a PCI loan was recognized when the underlying loan was removed from a pool.
(b) Includes modified PCD loans and loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been placed
on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses modified or reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR
is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.

(c) The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.
(d) Excludes HTM securities, which had an allowance for credit losses of $120 million and a provision for credit losses of $110 million as of and for the nine months ended

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of
principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising
from the investment securities portfolio or from principal
investments. The investment securities portfolio is predominantly
held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s balance
sheet or asset-liability management objectives. Principal
investments are predominantly privately-held financial instruments
and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are
typically intended to be held over extended periods and,
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized
gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a
default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is
mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by
Treasury and CIO is predominantly invested in high-quality
securities. At September 30, 2020, the Treasury and CIO
investment securities portfolio, net of allowance for credit losses,
was $529.2 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities
comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings
where available and where not available, based primarily upon
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages
46-47 and Note 10 for further information on the investment
securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Market Risk
Management on pages 80–84 for further information on the market
risk inherent in the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management
on pages 55–59 for further information on related liquidity risk.

Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically private non-traded financial
instruments representing ownership or other forms of junior capital
and span multiple asset classes. These investments are made by
dedicated investing businesses or as part of a broader business
strategy. In general, new principal investments include tax-oriented
investments, as well as investments made to enhance or
accelerate LOB and Corporate strategic business initiatives. The
Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and
Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results.
The aggregate carrying values of the principal investment
portfolios have not been significantly affected by recent market
events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the
duration and severity of adverse macroeconomic conditions could
subject certain principal investments to impairments, write-downs,
or other negative impacts.

As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the aggregate
carrying values of the principal investment portfolios were $23.9
billion and $24.2 billion, respectively, which included tax-oriented
investments (e.g., affordable housing and alternative energy
investments) of $18.4 billion and $18.2 billion respectively, and
private equity, various debt and equity instruments, and real assets
of $5.5 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively.

Refer to page 118 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s Investment Portfolio Risk Management
governance and oversight.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in
market factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity
and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the
value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 119–126 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s
Market Risk Management organization, market risk measurement,
risk monitoring and control, and predominant business activities
that give rise to market risk.

COVID-19 Pandemic
Market Risk Management is actively monitoring the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on market risk exposures by leveraging
existing risk measures and controls.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and
may be limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict
losses. This imprecision may be heightened when sudden or
severe shifts in market conditions occur, such as those observed
at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional discussion
on model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 87.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s existing
market risk measures to identify opportunities for enhancement,
and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate those measures
accordingly over time. This is increasingly important in periods of
sustained, heightened market volatility.

Value-at-risk
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical risk
measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market
moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single
VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management
VaR and Regulatory VaR.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-
day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which
approximates a 95% confidence level. For risk management
purposes, the Firm believes this methodology provides a daily
measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management
decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other
market risk measures, provides the appropriate information
needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates separately a
daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules
(“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory
VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and
enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s
portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the
Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors.
Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results.
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 135 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for information regarding
model reviews and approvals.

Refer to page 121 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for
further information regarding VaR, including the inherent
limitations, and the key differences between Risk Management
VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III
Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available
on the Firm’s website at:
(http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/basel.cfm) for
additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other
components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g.,
VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the
respective backtesting). Refer to Other risk measures on pages
124-126 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for further
information regarding nonstatistical market risk measures used by
the Firm.

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to

imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.

(b) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification benefit is not

meaningful.

Quarter over quarter results
Average total VaR decreased by $40 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2020 when compared with the prior quarter.
This decrease was driven by the fixed income risk type, reflecting
an overall risk reduction, as well as the scope refinement
described below.

Effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to
exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and
included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more
effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence of
this refinement, the average Total VaR and each of the
components would have been different by the amounts reported in
the following table:

Year over year results
Average total VaR increased by $51 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2020 when compared with the same period
in the prior year. This increase was driven by the substantial
increase in volatility in the one-year historical look-back period as
a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The most significant impacts
were reflected in the fixed income and commodities risk types.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to
exclude positions related to the risk management of interest rate
exposure from changes in the Firm’s own credit spread on fair
value option elected liabilities, and included these positions in
other sensitivity-based measures. Additionally, effective July 1,
2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-
backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other
sensitivity-based measures. In the absence of these refinements,
the average Total VaR and each of the components would have

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses that
are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses in the chart below do not reflect the Firm’s revenue results as they exclude
select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading
and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded
components of total net revenue may more than offset backtesting gains and losses on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains
and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.

The following chart compares Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses with the Firm’s Risk Management VaR for the 12 months ended
September 30, 2020. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s
Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

For the 12 months ended September 30, 2020, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 151 of the 260 days, and observed 13 VaR backtesting
exceptions, which were predominantly driven by volatility at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic that was materially higher than the levels
realized in the historical data used for the VaR calculation. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, the Firm posted backtesting
gains on 44 of the 66 days, and did not observe any VaR backtesting exceptions as the higher volatility is fully embedded in the look-back
period used for the VaR calculation. Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets and Equity
Markets posted losses, as disclosed in the CIB Markets revenue results, as the population of positions which compose each metric are
different and due to the exclusion of select components of total net revenue in backtesting gains and losses as described above. For more
information on CIB Markets revenue results, refer to page 36 .

Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net
income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the
Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only
from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking
activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities,
taking deposits and issuing debt as well as from the investment
securities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 120 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate,
identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.

One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is
through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s
interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is
presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest
income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses
market interest rates and in the case of deposits, pricing
assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this
baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities
denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S.
dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily include retained
loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long
term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and exclude other
positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based
measures as described on page 120 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019
Form 10-K.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net
interest income baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing
multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift
involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an
equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term
rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield
curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term
rates constant. These scenarios consider many different factors,
including:

• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes

in interest rates from baseline rates.

• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and
reinvestment behavior, but do not include assumptions about
actions that could be taken by the Firm in response to any such
instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions
are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared
with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and
other factors which are updated periodically based on historical
experience.

• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, using normalized deposit

betas which represent the amount by which deposit rates paid
could change upon a given change in market interest rates over
the cycle. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios may differ
from actual deposit rates paid, particularly for retail deposits, due
to repricing lags and other factors.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated
and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the
Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements
in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. While a relevant
measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings at risk
analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest
income (Refer to Outlook on page 8 for additional information).

The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of September
30, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 reflected updates to the
Firm’s baseline for lower short-term and long-term rates as well as
the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet.

The Firm’s sensitivity to rates is primarily a result of assets
repricing at a faster pace than deposits.

Based upon current and implied market rates as of September 30,
2020, scenarios reflecting lower rates could result in negative
interest rates. The U.S. has never experienced an interest rate
environment where the Federal Reserve has a negative interest
rate policy. While the impact of negative interest rates on the
Firm's earnings-at-risk would vary by scenario, a parallel shift
downward of up to 100bps would negatively impact net interest
income. In a negative interest rate environment, the modeling
assumptions used for certain assets and liabilities require
additional management judgment and therefore, the actual
outcomes may differ from these assumptions.

The Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and funding activities by assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other
comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the table Predominant
business activities that give rise to market risk on page 120 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions
captured in other sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-sensitive instruments that are not
included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being
hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at
September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to
imply management’s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to
country risk resulting from financial, economic, political or other
significant developments which adversely affect the value of the
Firm’s exposures related to a particular country or set of countries.
The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various
portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and
measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified
given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Refer to pages 127–128 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for
a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management.

COVID-19 Pandemic
Country Risk Management continues to monitor the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on countries to which the Firm has exposure,
leveraging tailored analysis and existing stress testing, exposure
reporting and controls.

Risk Reporting
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by
country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2020 and their
comparative exposures as of December 31, 2019. The selection of
countries represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by country,
based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach,
and does not represent the Firm’s view of any actual or potentially
adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from
period to period due to client activity and market flows.

The overall increase in top 20 exposures was predominantly
driven by client activity and demand for liquidity, relative to the
period ending December 31, 2019. This resulted in an increase in
cash placements primarily with the central banks of Germany, the
United Kingdom and Australia.

COVID-19 Pandemic
The Firm’s Technology and Cybersecurity operations continue to
monitor the Firm’s systems 24 hours a day, seven days a week
including responding to threat activity using COVID-19 themes in
phishing and other social engineering campaigns.

The Technology function is actively supporting the Firm’s response
to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Firm’s
expanded use of remote collaboration tools and platforms.
Technology diligently monitors the operational performance of the
Firm’s infrastructure to support increased market volumes as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Operational risk is the risk associated with an adverse outcome
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems;
human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s processes
or systems; it includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations
and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities
and can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts,
business interruptions, cybersecurity attacks, inappropriate
employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws and
regulations or failure of vendors to perform in accordance with
their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to
manage operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s
financial position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the
markets and regulatory environments in which it operates. Refer to
Operational Risk Management on pages 129-131 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Operational
Risk Management.

Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. Operational
risk subcategories such as Compliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal
risk, and Estimations and Model risk as well as other operational
risks, can lead to losses which are captured through the Firm’s
operational risk measurement processes. Refer to Compliance
Risk Management on page 132, Conduct Risk Management on
page 133, Legal Risk Management on page 134 and Estimations
and Model Risk Management on page 135 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2019 Form 10-K for more information. Details on other select
examples of operational risks are provided below.

Business and Technology Resiliency Risk
Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s
control such as severe weather, power or telecommunications
loss, accidents, failure of a third party to provide expected
services, cyberattack, flooding, transit strikes, terrorism, health
emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics. The
Firmwide resiliency program is intended to enable the Firm to
recover its critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e.,
staff, technology and facilities) in the event of a business
interruption, while prioritizing the health and safety
of employees and customers. The program includes governance,
awareness training, and testing of recovery strategies, as well as
strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage
business interruption and public safety risks. The strength and
proficiency of the Firmwide resiliency program has played an
integral role in maintaining the Firm’s business operations during
and after various events.

86

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT

Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is
the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on
incorrect or misused estimation outputs.

The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment based
estimations across various businesses and functions. The
estimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are
used for many purposes, such as the valuation of positions,
measurement of risk, sizing the allowance for credit losses,
assessing regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress
testing, and making business decisions.

While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of imprecision
or uncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic
environment. This is particularly true when the current and
forecasted environment is significantly different from the historical
macroeconomic environments upon which the models were
calibrated, as the Firm has experienced during the COVID-19
pandemic. This uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of
judgment and analytics to inform adjustments to model outputs
than in typical periods.

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages
88–90 and Note 2 of this Form 10-Q, and Estimations and Model
Risk Management section on page 135 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2019 Form 10-K for a summary of model-based valuations and
other valuation techniques.

87

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are
integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most
complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to
ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.
The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended
to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made
as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently
reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The
methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors,
the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and
risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s
businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures
are intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its
assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief
description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving
significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management’s
estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life
of the Firm’s financial assets measured at amortized cost and
certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained

loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which

covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a
number of matters including development and weighting of
macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss
experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk
ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining
expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information
on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and
methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit
losses.

One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the
Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic
forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter
forecast period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-quarter
forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables
(“MEVs”) that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with
modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than
twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect
on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and
geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S. unemployment,
house price index (“HPI”) and U.S. real gross domestic product
(“GDP”).

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP, U.S.
unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate credit spreads, oil
prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of economic
conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit
losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to
significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to
the next.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a weak labor market and
weak overall economic conditions that will continue to affect
borrowers across the Firm’s consumer and wholesale lending
portfolios. Significant judgment is required to estimate the severity
and duration of the current economic downturn, as well as its
potential impact on borrower defaults and loss severities. In
particular, macroeconomic conditions and forecasts regarding the
duration and severity of the economic downturn caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic have been rapidly changing and remain
highly uncertain. It is difficult to predict exactly how borrower
behavior will be impacted by these changes in economic
conditions. The effectiveness of government support, customer
assistance and enhanced unemployment benefits should act as
mitigants to credit losses, but the extent of the mitigation impact
remains uncertain.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or
input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because
management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in
estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors
and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may
not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and
changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent,
such that improvement in one factor or input may offset
deterioration in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic
forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined
using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios,
which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the
allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The
central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those
variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario described
on page 77 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative adverse scenario
assumes a significantly elevated U.S. unemployment rate through
the first half of 2021, averaging 3.0% higher over the eight-quarter
forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 4.3% in the first
quarter of 2021; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery,
remaining nearly 3% lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast,
with a peak difference of nearly 6.8% in the

88

fourth quarter of 2020; and an 11.5% further deterioration in the
national HPI with a trough in the first quarter of 2022.
This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes
in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons,
including:

• the Firm has placed significant weight on its adverse scenarios
in estimating its allowance for credit losses as of September 30,
2020, and accordingly, the existing allowance already reflects
credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario

• the impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and

nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply
extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic
variables

• the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs at a speed
and to degrees not seen in recent history, adding significantly
higher degrees of uncertainty around modeled credit loss
estimations which use scenarios outside of historical experience

• significant changes in the expected severity and duration of the
economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the
effects of government support and customer assistance, and the
speed of the subsequent recovery could significantly affect the
Firm’s estimate of expected credit losses irrespective of the
estimated sensitivities described below.

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to
macroeconomic forecasts as of September 30, 2020, the Firm
compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse
scenario to its central scenario. Without considering the additional
weight the Firm has placed on its adverse scenarios or any other
offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of
the Firm’s allowance for credit losses for these lending exposures,
the difference between these two scenarios would result in the
following:

• An increase of approximately $1 billion for residential real estate

loans and lending-related commitments

• An increase of approximately $5 billion for credit card loans

• An increase of approximately $4 billion for wholesale loans and

lending-related commitments

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and
is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for
credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other
adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be
influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled
lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of
these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current
circumstances and conditions.

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent economic
conditions, the Firm believes that its process to

consider the available information and associated risks and
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of
expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the
period ended September 30, 2020.

Fair value
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair
value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at
fair value on a recurring basis, including, derivatives, structured
note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain
assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans,
where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the
underlying collateral.

Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair
value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level
3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information.

(a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the

impact of netting adjustments; however, the $8.0 billion of derivative
receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as
such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of
inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would be reduced if
netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash
collateral.

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type
and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount
of observable market information available to the Firm. For
instruments valued using internally developed valuation models
and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable
inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation
hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more

Management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill
for impairment. The goodwill associated with each business
combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill
impairment testing. Refer to Goodwill impairment on page 137 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a description of the
significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill
impairment.

Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, including
the goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, 2020.

Credit card rewards liability
The credit card rewards liability was $7.6 billion and $6.4 billion at
September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and is
recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to pages 137-138 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a description of the
significant assumptions and judgments associated with the Firm’s
credit card rewards liability.

Income taxes
Refer to Income taxes on page 138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019
Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions,
judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for
income taxes.

Litigation reserves
Refer to Note 25 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 30 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a description of the significant
estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation
reserves.

significant than those required when estimating the fair value of
instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level
3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation
technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain
significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant
empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example,
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment rates,
default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices,
valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and
credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs
used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the
Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that
meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The
judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and
its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the
product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened
market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by
the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly
for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other
factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a
particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its
valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of
other market participants, the methods and assumptions used
reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s
businesses and portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the
determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a
different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note
2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and
hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial
instruments.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS

Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Standards Adopted since January 1, 2020

Standard

Summary of guidance

Effects on financial statements

• Adopted January 1, 2020.

• Refer to Note 1 for further information.

• Adopted January 1, 2020.
• No impact upon adoption as the guidance is to be applied prospectively.

• Refer to Note 15 for further information.

• Issued and effective March 12, 2020.
• The Firm elected to prospectively apply certain of the practical

expedients related to contract modifications and hedge accounting
relationships beginning in the third quarter of 2020. While these
elections did not have a material impact to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, they ease the administrative burden of accounting for
contracts impacted by reference rate reform.

Reference Rate
Reform

Issued March 2020

 • Establishes a single allowance framework for all
financial assets measured at amortized cost and
certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This
framework requires that management’s estimate
reflects credit losses over the instrument’s remaining
expected life and considers expected future changes
in macroeconomic conditions.

 • Eliminates existing guidance for PCI loans, and

requires recognition of the nonaccretable difference as
an increase to the allowance for expected credit
losses on financial assets purchased with more than
insignificant credit deterioration since origination, with
a corresponding increase in the amortized cost of the
related loans.

 • Requires inclusion of expected recoveries, limited to

the cumulative amount of prior write-offs, when
estimating the allowance for credit losses for in scope
financial assets (including collateral-dependent
assets).

 • Amends existing impairment guidance for AFS

securities to incorporate an allowance, which will allow
for reversals of credit impairments in the event that the
credit of an issuer improves.

 • Requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained

earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period of
adoption.

 • Requires recognition of an impairment loss when the
estimated fair value of a reporting unit falls below its
carrying value.

 • Eliminates the requirement that an impairment loss be
recognized only if the estimated implied fair value of
the goodwill is below its carrying value.

 • Provides optional expedients and exceptions to
current accounting guidance when financial
instruments, hedge accounting relationships, and
other transactions are amended due to reference rate
reform.

 • Provides an election to account for certain contract
amendments related to reference rate reform as
modifications rather than extinguishments without the
requirement to assess the significance of the
amendments.

 • Allows for changes in critical terms of a hedge

accounting relationship without automatic termination
of that relationship. Provides various practical
expedients and elections designed to allow hedge
accounting to continue uninterrupted during the
transition period.

 • Provides a one-time election to transfer securities out
of the held-to-maturity classification if certain criteria
are met.
