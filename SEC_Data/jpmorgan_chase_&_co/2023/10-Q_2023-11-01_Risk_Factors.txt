JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of First Republic Bank may not result in all of the benefits anticipated. 

On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank from the FDIC (the &#8220;First Republic acquisition&#8221;). There can be no assurance that the First Republic acquisition will have the anticipated positive results, including with respect to: 

&#8226; the total cost of integration 

&#8226; the time required to complete the integration 

&#8226; the amount of longer-term cost savings 

&#8226; the overall performance of the assets and liabilities acquired in the First Republic acquisition, or 

&#8226; an improved price for JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s common stock. 

Integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly, and typically will involve the combination of relevant accounting and data processing systems and management controls, as well as managing relevant relationships with employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners. Integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s operations or results. In addition, JPMorgan Chase could incur unanticipated costs or losses in connection with the First Republic acquisition and its integration efforts. 

Acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause JPMorgan Chase to lose clients and customers, or cause clients and customers to move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees. In addition, the loss of key employees in connection with the First Republic acquisition could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s ability to successfully conduct its business.
