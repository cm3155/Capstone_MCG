(a) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.
(b) The capital metrics reflect the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition 
provisions that became effective in the first quarter of 2020. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 45-50 of this Form 10-Q and pages 91-101 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information.

Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the second 
quarter of 2021 versus the second quarter of 2020, unless 
otherwise specified.

Firmwide overview 
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $11.9 billion for 
the second quarter of 2021, or $3.78 per share, on net 
revenue of $30.5 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 18% 
and ROTCE of 23%. The Firm's results for the second 
quarter of 2021 included a reduction in the allowance for 
credit losses of $3.0 billion compared to an increase in the 
allowance for credit losses of $8.9 billion in the prior year.  

• Net income was $11.9 billion, up $7.3 billion.

• Total net revenue was down 8%.

– Noninterest revenue was $17.7 billion, down 8%,  

driven by lower CIB Markets revenue, largely offset by 
higher Investment Banking fees in CIB, higher Card 
income and higher management fees in AWM.

– The prior year included $678 million of mark-ups on 

held-for-sale positions in the bridge financing 
portfolio in CIB and CB.

– Net interest income was $12.7 billion, down 8%, 

predominantly driven by CIB Markets and lower loans 
in Card.

• Noninterest expense was $17.7 billion, up 4%, largely 

driven by continued investments in the business, 
including technology and front office hiring, as well as 
higher volume-related brokerage expense in CIB and 
distribution expense in AWM.

• The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $2.3 

billion driven by net reductions in the allowance for credit 
losses of $3.0 billion, compared to an expense of $10.5 
billion in the prior year predominantly driven by net 
additions to the allowance for credit losses of $8.9 
billion.

• The total allowance for credit losses was $22.6 billion at 

June 30, 2021. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses 
to retained loans coverage ratio of 2.02%, compared 
with 2.42% in the first quarter of 2021, and 3.27% in 
the prior year; the decrease from the first quarter of 
2021 was driven by net reductions in the allowance for 
loan losses due to improvements in the Firm's economic 
outlook.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $9.8 billion at 
June 30, 2021, relatively flat versus the prior year. 
Nonperforming assets were down $455 million from 
March 31, 2021, driven by lower nonaccrual loans in the 
consumer and wholesale portfolios, reflecting improved 
credit performance, partially offset by higher derivative 
receivables.

• Firmwide average loans of $1.0 trillion were flat versus 
the prior year, as lower loans in CB and CCB were offset 
by the net origination of Paycheck Protection Program 
("PPP") loans, as well as growth in AWM and CIB.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.3 trillion were up 23%, 
reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily 
driven by the effect of certain government actions in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

• As of June 30, 2021, the Firm had average eligible High 
Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of approximately $717 
billion and unencumbered marketable securities with a 
fair value of approximately $854 billion, resulting in 
approximately $1.6 trillion of liquidity sources. Refer to 
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-55 for additional 
information.

Outlook
These current expectations are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on 
the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s 
management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q, 
and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to 
Forward-Looking Statements on page 88 and Risk Factors on 
page 190 of this Form 10-Q and pages 8–32 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of certain of 
those risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could 
cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially 
because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no 
assurance that actual results will be in line with the outlook 
set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update 
any forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for 2021 should be 
viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. 
economies, the COVID-19 pandemic, financial markets 
activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive 
environment, client and customer activity levels, and 
regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and 
other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these 
factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its LOBs. 
The Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to 
its businesses and operations in response to ongoing 
developments in the business, economic, regulatory and 
legal environments in which it operates. The outlook 
information contained in this Form 10-Q supersedes all 
outlook information furnished by the Firm in its periodic 
reports filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Form 10-
Q. 

Full-year 2021
• Management expects net interest income, on a managed 

basis, to be approximately $52.5 billion, market 
dependent.

• Management expects adjusted expense to be 
approximately $71 billion, market dependent.

• Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card to be 

less than 2.5%.

Net interest income, on a managed basis, and adjusted 
expense are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to 
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures on pages 19-20.

Recent events

11.3%). The Federal Reserve Board will provide the 
Firm with its final SCB requirement by August 31, 
2021, and that requirement will become effective on

Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
On March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority 
confirmed that the publication of the principal tenors of the 
U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") (i.e., 
overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-
month LIBOR) will cease immediately following a final 
publication on June 30, 2023. The scheduled cessation date 
for U.K. sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and Euro LIBOR, 
and the one-week and two-month tenors of U.S. dollar 
LIBOR, remains December 31, 2021, and the Firm is 
prioritizing those currencies and tenors of LIBOR for 
contract remediation in 2021.

The Firm continues to make progress on its initiatives to 
mitigate the risks to the Firm associated with IBOR 
discontinuation. As part of the transition, the Firm 
continues to engage with clients on contract remediation. 
The Firm also continues to monitor the transition relief 
being considered by the U.S. Treasury Department 
regarding the tax implications of reference rate reform.

(b)  Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Quarterly results
Investment banking fees increased across products in CIB, 
reflecting:

• higher advisory fees due to a higher number of completed 

transactions

• higher debt underwriting fees driven by an active 

acquisition finance market, partially offset by lower 
investment grade bond fees, and

• higher equity underwriting fees driven by an active IPO 
market, predominantly offset by lower fees from follow-
on and convertible securities offerings.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 28-33 and Note 5 for 
additional information.
Principal transactions revenue decreased in CIB, primarily 
reflecting:
• lower revenue in Fixed Income Markets across products 

compared to a strong prior year,

partially offset by

• higher revenue in Equity Markets driven by strong 

performance in prime brokerage.

The decrease in Principal transactions also reflects the 
absence of two significant items in the prior year: $678 
million of mark-ups on held-for-sale positions in the bridge 
financing portfolio in CIB and CB, and a $510 million gain in 
CIB's Credit Adjustments & Other, both of which represent 
reversals of a portion of the losses that were recognized in 
the first quarter of 2020.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases 
have offsets across other revenue lines, including net 
interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its 
CIB Markets business on a total revenue basis.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 28-33  and Note 5 
for additional information. 

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased reflecting:

• higher cash management fees and higher lending-related 
fees, particularly loan commitment fees, in CIB and CB, 
and

• higher deposit-related fees in CCB, reflecting higher 

transaction activity.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 28-33, CB on pages 
34-37 and CCB on pages 23-27, and Note 5 for additional 
information.

Asset management, administration and commissions 
revenue increased driven by higher asset management fees 
in AWM as a result of higher average market levels and 
strong cumulative net inflows into long-term products, net 
of liquidity fee waivers, and in CCB related to the higher 
level of client investment assets on higher average market 
levels and net inflows.

Refer to AWM and CCB segment results on pages 38-41, 
and pages 23-27, respectively, and Note 5 for additional 
information on asset management, administration and 
commissions revenue.

Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected the impact 
of repositioning the investment securities portfolio. Refer to 
Corporate segment results on pages 42-43 and Note 9 for 
additional information on investment securities gains/
(losses).

Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to:
• lower mortgage production revenue reflecting lower 

production margins, partially offset by higher volumes, 
and

• lower net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting a net 
loss in MSR risk management results, compared with a 
net gain in the prior period.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 23-27, Note 5 and 
14 for additional information.

Card income increased as a result of higher net interchange 
income and higher merchant processing fees, reflecting in 
the second quarter of 2021, the acceleration of debit and 
credit card sales volume above pre-pandemic levels, and 
lower acquisition costs. Refer to CCB segment results on 
pages 23-27 and Note 5 for additional information.

Other income increased reflecting: 

• higher gains on several investments, primarily in CIB,

predominantly offset by

• lower operating lease income as a result of the decline in 

auto operating lease volume in CCB

• increased amortization on a higher level of alternative 
energy investments in the tax-oriented investment 
portfolio in CIB. The increased amortization was more 
than offset by lower income tax expense from the 
associated tax credits.

Net interest income decreased driven by lower Markets NII 
and lower loans in Card.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.2 
trillion, up $358 billion, predominantly driven by higher 
deposits with banks and investment securities, and the yield 
was 1.79%, down 52 basis points (“bps”), primarily due to 
lower rates. The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, 
was 1.62%, a decrease of 37 bps. The net yield excluding 
CIB Markets was 1.90%, down 37 bps.
Net yield on an FTE basis, and net yield excluding CIB 
Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the 
Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates 
schedule on page 179 for further details; and the 
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures on pages 19-20 for a further 
discussion of Net interest yield excluding CIB Markets.

Year-to-date results
Investment banking fees increased across products in CIB, 
reflecting:
• higher equity underwriting fees driven by an active IPO 

market

• higher advisory fees driven by a higher number of 

completed transactions, and

• higher debt underwriting fees driven by an active 

acquisition finance market.

Principal transactions revenue was flat, primarily 
reflecting:

• higher revenue in CIB Equity Markets driven by strong 
performance across derivatives, prime brokerage, and 
Cash Equities

• higher net gains on certain legacy private equity 

investments in Corporate, and

• the absence of two significant items in the prior year: a 

$441 million net loss in CIB’s Credit Adjustments & Other, 
and $218 million of net markdowns on held-for-sale 
positions in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB,

offset by

• lower revenue in CIB Fixed Income Markets, primarily 

driven by reductions in Rates and Currencies & Emerging 
Markets, compared to a strong prior year, partially offset 
by an increase in Securitized Products.

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased reflecting:

• higher cash management fees and higher lending-related 
fees, particularly loan commitment fees, in CIB and CB, 

predominantly offset by

• lower overdraft fees in CCB.

Asset management, administration and commissions 
revenue increased driven by higher asset management fees 
as a result of higher asset management fees in AWM as a 
result of strong cumulative net inflows into long-term and 
liquidity products and higher average market levels, net of 
liquidity fee waivers, and in CCB related to the higher level 
of client investment assets on higher average market levels 
and net inflows.
Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected the impact 
of repositioning the investment securities portfolio. 

Mortgage fees and related income was relatively flat 
primarily reflecting higher mortgage production revenue, 
on higher production volumes, offset by lower net mortgage 
servicing revenue as a result of a higher net loss in MSR risk 
management results.

Card income increased as a result of higher net interchange 
income and higher merchant processing fees, reflecting in 
the first half of 2021, the acceleration of debit and credit 
card sales volume above pre-pandemic levels, and lower 
acquisition costs.

11

Other income decreased reflecting:

• increased amortization on a higher level of alternative 
energy investments in the tax-oriented investment 
portfolio in CIB. The increased amortization was more 
than offset by lower income tax expense from the 
associated tax credits. Additionally, the first quarter of 
2021 included weather-related write-downs on certain 
renewable energy investments

• lower operating lease income as a result of the decline in 

auto operating lease volume in CCB, and

• lower gains on certain Corporate investments,

predominantly offset by

• gains on several investments compared with losses in the 

prior year, primarily in CIB and AWM.

Net interest income decreased predominantly driven by the 
impact of lower rates, partially offset by balance sheet 
growth. 

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.2 
trillion, up $509 billion, predominantly driven by higher 
deposits with banks and investment securities, and the yield 
was 1.83%, down 87 basis points (“bps”), primarily due to 
lower rates. The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, 
was 1.65%, a decrease of 52 bps. The net yield excluding 
CIB Markets was 1.92%, down 69 bps.

Quarterly results
The provision for credit losses decreased driven by net 
reductions in the allowance for credit losses. 
The decrease in consumer was driven by:
• a $2.6 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses, 
including $1.8 billion in Card reflecting improvements in 
the Firm's economic outlook; and $600 million in Home 
Lending primarily due to continued improvements in 
home price index ("HPI") expectations, and

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, reflecting 
lower charge-offs and higher recoveries as consumer 
cash balances remained elevated benefiting from the 
ongoing impact of government stimulus and payment 
assistance programs;

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks 
increased primarily as a result of the continued growth in 
deposits and limited deployment opportunities in Treasury 
and CIO. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placements 
of its excess cash with various central banks, including the 
Federal Reserve Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale 
agreements decreased driven by:

• lower deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO, and lower 

Investment securities decreased due to paydowns and net 
sales in available-for-sale ("AFS"), partially offset by the net 
impact of purchases and paydowns in held-to-maturity. AFS 
securities of $104.5 billion were transferred to the HTM 
portfolio for capital management purposes. Refer to 
Corporate segment results on pages 42-43, Investment 
Portfolio Risk Management on page 75, and Notes 2 and 9 
for additional information.

Loans increased, reflecting:

client-driven market-making activities in CIB,

• higher secured lending in CIB Markets; and in AWM higher 

partially offset by

• higher demand for securities to cover short positions in 

CIB.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-55 and 
Note 10 for additional information.

Securities borrowed increased driven by CIB reflecting 
higher client-driven activities in Fixed Income Markets, and 
an increase in the demand for securities to cover short 
positions in Equity Markets. Refer to Liquidity Risk 
Management on pages 51-55 and Note 10 for additional 
information.

Trading assets increased reflecting;
• strong client-driven market-making activities in equity 

instruments, largely in prime brokerage,

partially offset by
• lower debt instruments, in CIB Fixed Income Markets, and
• lower deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO. 
Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.

securities-based and custom lending, as well as 
mortgages,

partially offset by

• lower loans in CCB and CB, which included the impact of 

PPP forgiveness.

The allowance for loan losses decreased, consisting of:

• a $7.0 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in 

the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the 
Firm's economic outlook; and in the residential real 
estate portfolio, primarily due to continued 
improvements in HPI expectations, and 

• a $1.8 billion net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs, 
reflecting improvements in the Firm's economic outlook.

There was a $589 million net addition to the allowance for 
lending-related commitments, driven by wholesale. This 
allowance is included in other liabilities on the consolidated 
balance sheets. The total net reduction to the allowance for 
credit losses was $8.2 billion, as of June 30, 2021.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
56-75, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for a more detailed 
discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased driven by 
higher MSRs as a result of net additions, as well as lower 
prepayment speeds on higher rates. Refer to Note 14 for 
additional information.

Deposits increased across the LOBs primarily driven by the 
effect of certain government actions in response to the 
COVID 19 pandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by 
growth from existing and new accounts across both 
consumer and small business customers. Refer to Liquidity 
Risk Management on pages 51-55 and Notes 2 and 15 for 
additional information.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements increased reflecting:

• the impact of client activities and higher secured 

financing of trading assets in CIB,

partially offset by

• lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in 

Treasury and CIO.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-55 and 
Note 10 for additional information.

Short-term borrowings increased predominantly as a result 
of higher financing of prime brokerage activities in CIB. 
Refer to pages 51-55 for information on changes in 
Liquidity Risk Management. 

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market-
making activities in CIB Fixed Income Markets, which 
resulted in higher levels of short positions in debt 
instruments, partially offset by lower derivative payables 
primarily as a result of market movements. Refer to Notes 2 
and 4 for additional information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased 
predominantly due to the impact of securities financing 
transactions and higher client payables related to client-
driven activities, both in CIB prime brokerage. Refer to Note 
10 for additional information on securities financing 
transactions.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs decreased 
predominantly driven by maturities of credit card 
securitizations in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Off-Balance 
Sheet Arrangements on page 18 and Notes 13 and 22 for 
additional information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan 
securitization trusts.

Long-term debt increased driven by net issuances, partially 
offset by fair value hedge accounting adjustments related to 
higher rates. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
51-55 for additional information. 

Stockholders’ equity increased reflecting net income, 
partially offset by the impact of capital actions, and the  
decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income 
(“AOCI”). The decrease in AOCI was driven by the impact of 
higher rates on the AFS securities portfolio and cash flow 
hedges. Refer to page 92 for information on changes in 
stockholders’ equity, Capital actions on pages 48-49, and 
Note 19 for additional information on AOCI.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations that 
may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are disclosed as off-
balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). 

Special-purpose entities
The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities 
(“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees). 

The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative contracts 
and lending-related commitments and guarantees.

The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions 
with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing. 

The table below provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q discussions of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet arrangements 
can be found. Refer to Note 1 for additional information about the Firm’s consolidation policies.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred 
to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on 
pages 89-93.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported 
basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP 
financial measures at the Firmwide and segment 
level. These non-GAAP measures include:
• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the 

overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to 
present total net revenue from investments that receive 
tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis 
comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE” 
basis)

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue 

less total noninterest expense

• Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB Markets

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS

• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense 

excluding Firmwide legal expense

• Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, 

excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use Of 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance 
Measures on pages 62–64 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of non-
GAAP financial measures.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major 
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community 
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial 
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there 
is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the 
products and services provided, or the type of customer 
served, and they reflect the manner in which financial 
information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating 
Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed 
basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s 
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 19-20 for a 
definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present 
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The 
management reporting process that derives business 
segment results includes the allocation of certain income 
and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the 
assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications 
used for segment reporting, and further refinements may 
be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses 
the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an 
annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business 
metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and 
analysts in assessing performance. 

Revenue sharing 
When business segments join efforts to sell products and 
services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business 
segments may agree to share revenue from those 
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the 
segment responsible for the related product or service, with 
allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the 
transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-
sharing agreements.

Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred 
to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and 
methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and 
as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. 
Refer to Line of business equity on page 48, and page 98 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional 
information on capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business 
segment reporting methodology on pages 65–66 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion 
of those methodologies.

Quarterly results
Net income was $5.6 billion, up $5.8 billion, predominantly 
driven by a decrease in the provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $12.8 billion, an increase of 3%. 

Net interest income was $8.0 billion, down 1%, driven by:

• lower loans in Card due to the impact of higher payments 
and lower cumulative sales volume throughout 2020, and 
deposit margin compression in CBB,

predominantly offset by

• growth in deposits, accelerated recognition of deferred 
processing fees due to PPP loan forgiveness in CBB and 
lower funding costs in Card.

Noninterest revenue was $4.7 billion, up 12%, driven by:

• higher card income due to higher net interchange income 
reflecting the acceleration in the second quarter of 2021 
of debit and credit card sales volume, above pre-pandemic 
levels, and lower acquisition costs, 

• a higher level of client investment assets on higher 

average market levels and net inflows, and 

• higher deposit-related fees due to higher transaction 

activity,

largely offset by

• lower mortgage production revenue reflecting lower 

production margins partially offset by higher volumes, 

• lower net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting a net loss 
in MSR risk management results, compared with a net 
gain in the prior period, and

• lower auto lease volume.

Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes 
in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and 
mortgage fees and related income.

Noninterest expense was $7.1 billion, up 4%, driven by:

• continued investments in the business and higher volume- 

and revenue-related expense, including marketing 
expense reflecting higher travel-related benefits and 
marketing campaigns,

partially offset by 

• lower depreciation from lower auto lease assets.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $1.9 
billion, compared with an expense of $5.8 billion in the prior 
year, driven by:

• a $2.6 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses, 
driven by improvements in the Firm’s economic outlook, 
consisting of $1.8 billion in Card, $600 million in Home 
Lending, primarily due to continued improvement in HPI 
expectations, $125 million in CBB and $75 million in 
Auto, and

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
56-75 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 73-74 for 
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance 
for credit losses.
Year-to-date results
Net income was $12.4 billion, up $12.3 billion, driven by a 
decrease in the provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $25.3 billion, a decrease of 1%.

Net interest income was $16.0 billion, down 8%, driven by:

• the impact of deposit margin compression in CBB and 

lower loans in Card due to the impact of higher payments 
and lower cumulative sales volume throughout 2020,

largely offset by

• growth in deposits and accelerated recognition of 

deferred processing fees due to PPP loan forgiveness in 
CBB.

Noninterest revenue was $9.3 billion, up 12%, driven by:

• higher card income due to higher net interchange income 
reflecting the acceleration in the first half of 2021 of debit 
and credit card sales volume, above pre-pandemic levels, 
and lower acquisition costs, 

• higher mortgage production revenue reflecting higher 

production volumes, and

• a higher level of client investment assets on higher 

average market levels and net inflows,

partially offset by

• lower net mortgage servicing revenue as a result of a 

higher net loss in MSR risk management results

• lower auto lease volume, and

• lower overdraft fees.

Noninterest expense was $14.3 billion, up 2%, reflecting:

• continued investments in the business and higher volume- 

and revenue-related expense, including marketing 
expense reflecting higher travel-related benefits and 
marketing campaigns,

largely offset by

• lower deprecation from lower auto lease assets, and

• lower structural expenses.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $5.5

driven by improvements in the Firm’s economic outlook, 
consisting of $5.3 billion in Card, $1.2 billion in Home 
Lending, primarily due to continued improvement in HPI 
expectations, $475 million in CBB and $225 million in 
Auto, and 

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, reflecting 

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, reflecting

(a) At June 30, 2021 and 2020, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $397 

million and $561 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(b) Generally excludes loans that were under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio 
on pages 58-62 for further information on consumer payment assistance activity. The second quarter of 2021 includes loans to customers that have 
exited COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent at time 
of exit from COVID-19 payment deferral programs and charged down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to 
sell.

(c) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(d) At June 30, 2021 and 2020, included $16.7 billion and $19.9 billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP. The Firm does not expect 

to realize material credit losses on PPP loans, because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 57 for a further discussion of 
the PPP.

(e) At June 30, 2021 and 2020, the principal balance of loans in Home Lending, Card and Auto under payment deferral programs offered in response to the 

COVID-19 pandemic were as follows: (1) $5.2 billion and $18.2 billion in Home Lending, respectively; (2) $55 million and $4.4 billion in Card, 
respectively; and (3) $89 million and $12.3 billion in Auto, respectively. Loans that are performing according to their modified terms are generally not 
considered delinquent. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 58-62 for further information on consumer payment assistance activity.

(f) At June 30, 2021 and 2020, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $483 million and $826 million, respectively, that are 30 or 

more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.

Year-to-date results
Net income was $10.7 billion, up 44%.
Net revenue was $27.8 billion, up 5%.
Banking revenue was $9.6 billion, up 25%.
• Investment Banking revenue was $6.3 billion, up 46%, 
driven by higher Investment Banking fees, up 38%, 
reflecting higher fees across products, and the absence of 
prior year net markdowns of $161 million on held-for-
sale positions in the bridge financing portfolio. The Firm 
ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking fees, according 
to Dealogic.
– Equity underwriting fees were $2.1 billion, up 62%, 

driven by an active IPO market.

– Debt underwriting fees were $2.8 billion, up 22%, 
driven by an active acquisition finance market.

– Advisory fees were $1.6 billion, up 44%, driven by a 

higher number of completed transactions.

• Wholesale Payments revenue was $2.8 billion, up 2%, 

driven by higher deposit balances and fees, 
predominantly offset by deposit margin compression.
• Lending revenue was $494 million, down 20%, driven by 
lower net interest income, partially offset by higher loan 
commitment fees.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $18.2 billion, 
down 3%. Markets revenue was $15.8 billion, down 7%.
• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $9.9 billion, down 

20%, driven by lower revenue in Rates and Currencies & 
Emerging Markets compared to a strong prior year, 
partially offset by higher revenue in Securitized Products.
• Equity Markets revenue was $6.0 billion, up 29%, driven 

by strong performance across derivatives, prime 
brokerage, and Cash Equities.

• Securities Services revenue was $2.1 billion, down 2%, 
with deposit margin compression offset by growth in 
deposits and fees.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a gain of $230 million 

largely driven by valuation adjustments related to certain 
collateralized derivatives. The prior year loss of $441 
million was predominantly driven by losses on certain 
components of fair value option elected liabilities, as well 
as the impact of funding spread widening on derivatives.

Noninterest expense was $13.6 billion, up 7%, 
predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenue-
related expense, largely performance-related 
compensation, partially offset by lower legal expense.
The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $410 
million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with an expense of $3.4 billion in the 
prior year.

Quarterly results
Net income was $5.0 billion, down 9%.
Net revenue was $13.2 billion, down 19%.
Banking revenue was $5.1 billion, up 1%.
• Investment Banking revenue was $3.4 billion, up 1%, 
driven by higher Investment Banking fees, up 25%, 
reflecting higher fees across products. The prior year 
included $659 million of markups on held-for-sale 
positions in the bridge financing portfolio. The Firm 
ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking fees, according 
to Dealogic.
– Advisory fees were $916 million, up 52%, driven by a 

higher number of completed transactions.

– Debt underwriting fees were $1.6 billion, up 26%, 

driven by an active acquisition finance market, partially 
offset by lower investment grade bond fees.

– Equity underwriting fees were $1.1 billion, up 9%, 

driven by an active IPO market, predominantly offset 
by lower fees from follow-on and convertible securities 
offerings.

• Wholesale Payments revenue was $1.5 billion, up 5%, 

driven by higher deposit balances and fees, 
predominantly offset by deposit margin compression.
• Lending revenue was $229 million, down 15%, driven by 
lower net interest income, largely offset by lower fair 
value losses on hedges of accrual loans compared to the 
prior year.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $8.1 billion, 
down 28%. Markets revenue was $6.8 billion, down 30%.
• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $4.1 billion, down 

44%, driven by lower revenue across products compared 
to a strong prior year.

• Equity Markets revenue was $2.7 billion, up 13%, driven 
by strong performance across prime brokerage, Cash 
Equities, and derivatives.

• Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, down 1%, 
driven by deposit margin compression predominantly 
offset by growth in deposits and fees.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a gain of $233 million 

largely driven by valuation adjustments related to certain 
collateralized derivatives. The prior year gain of $510 
million was driven by funding spread tightening on 
derivatives.

Noninterest expense was $6.5 billion, down 4%, driven by 
lower revenue-related expense, primarily performance-
related compensation, partially offset by higher volume-
related brokerage expense.
The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $79 
million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with an expense of $2.0 billion in the 
prior year.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
56-75 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 73-74 for 
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the 
allowance for credit losses.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes select income statement 
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both 
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue 
comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and 
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm 
assesses its Markets business performance on a total 
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line 
items. For example, securities that generate net interest 
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are 

recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 5 
and 6 for a description of the composition of these income 
statement line items. Refer to Markets revenue on page 74 
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further 
information.
For the periods presented below, the predominant source of 
principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized 
upon executing new transactions.

Quarterly results
Net income was $1.4 billion, up $2.1 billion, primarily 
reflecting the absence of an increase in the allowance for 
credit losses recorded in the prior year. 

Net revenue was $2.5 billion, up 3%. Net interest income 
was $1.5 billion, down 3%, driven by deposit margin 
compression, predominantly offset by the impact of lower 
funding costs on loans. Noninterest revenue was $950 
million, up 15%, driven by higher investment banking 
revenue, wholesale payments activity, and lending fees 
partially offset by the absence of a prior year equity 
investment gain.     

Noninterest expense was $981 million, up 10%, 
predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenue- 
related expense and investments in the business.      

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $377 
million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with an expense of $2.4 billion in the 
prior year.  

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
56-75 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 73-74 for 
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the 
allowance for credit losses.

Year-to-date results
Net income was $2.6 billion, up $3.1 billion, primarily 
reflecting the absence of an increase in the allowance for 
credit losses recorded in the prior year.

Net revenue was $4.9 billion, up 7%. Net interest income 
was $3.0 billion, down 4%, driven by deposit margin 
compression, offset by the impact of lower funding costs on 
loans and higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was 
$1.9 billion, up 30%, predominantly driven by higher 
investment banking revenue and wholesale payments 
activity, partially offset by the absence of a prior year 
equity investment gain.

Noninterest expense was $2.0 billion, up 4%, driven by 
higher volume- and revenue-related expense and 
investments in the business. 

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $495 
million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with an expense of $3.4 billion in the 
prior year.

(a) In the first quarter of 2021, the Wealth Management business was renamed Global Private Bank. In the fourth quarter of 2020, certain wealth 

management clients were transferred from AWM Global Private Bank to the J.P. Morgan Wealth Management unit in CCB’s Consumer & Business Banking 
business. For further information see page 80 of the 2020 Form 10-K.

Quarterly results
Net income was $1.2 billion, up 74%.

Net revenue was $4.1 billion, up 20%. Net interest income 
was $942 million, up 10%. Noninterest revenue was $3.2 
billion, up 23%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $2.2 billion, up 26%, 
predominantly driven by:

• higher asset management fees on cumulative net inflows 

into long-term products and higher average market 
levels, net of liquidity fee waivers, and

• higher performance fees.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $1.9 billion, up 
13%, driven by:

• higher deposit and loan balances, higher asset 

management fees and the impact of lower funding costs 
on loans, partially offset by deposit margin compression. 

Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, up 11% driven by 
higher volume- and revenue-related expense, primarily 
performance-related compensation and distribution 
expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $10 
million, compared with an expense of $223 million in the 
prior year.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
56-75 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 73-74 for 
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the 
allowance for credit losses.

Year-to-date results
Net income was $2.4 billion, an increase of 80%.
Net revenue was $8.2 billion, an increase of 20%. Net 
interest income was $1.9 billion, up 9%. Noninterest 
revenue was $6.3 billion, up 24%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $4.4 billion, up 26%, 
predominantly driven by:

• higher asset management fees on strong cumulative net 
inflows into long-term and liquidity products and higher 
average market levels, net of liquidity fee waivers, and 

• net investment valuation gains, compared with losses in 

the prior year.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $3.8 billion, up 
14%, largely driven by: 

• higher deposit and loan balances, higher asset 

management fees and the impact of lower funding costs 
on loans, partially offset by deposit margin compression.

Noninterest expense was $5.2 billion, an increase of 8%, 
driven by higher volume- and revenue-related expense, 
primarily performance-related compensation and 
distribution expense, partially offset by lower structural 
expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $131 
million, driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with an expense of $317 million in the 
prior year.

(b) During the six months ended June 30, 2021, 1,155 technology and risk management employees were transferred from Corporate to CIB.

Quarterly results
Net loss was $1.2 billion compared with a net loss of $568 
million in the prior year.

Year-to-date results
Net loss was $1.8 billion compared with a net loss of $693 
million in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $1.2 billion, down $415 million, 
driven by:

• limited deployment opportunities as deposit growth 

continued, and

• net investment securities losses in the current quarter 
reflecting the impact of repositioning the investment 
securities portfolio.

Noninterest expense of $515 million was up $368 million 
predominantly due to higher legal and technology expense. 

The current period income tax benefit was predominantly 
driven by the change in the level and mix of income and 
expenses subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes.

Net revenue was a loss of $1.6 billion, compared with a loss 
of $588 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by 
lower net interest income on limited deployment 
opportunities as deposit growth continued as well as lower 
rates.  

Noninterest revenue decreased primarily due to net 
investment securities losses compared to net gains in the 
prior year reflecting repositioning of the investment 
securities portfolio in both periods, largely offset by net 
gains on certain legacy private equity investments, 

Noninterest expense of $1.4 billion was up $1.1 billion 
driven by a higher contribution to the Firm's Foundation 
and higher legal and technology expense. 

The current period income tax benefit was driven by the 
change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject 
to U.S. federal and state and local taxes as well as the 
impact of the Firm's estimated full-year expected tax rate 
relative to the level of year-to-date pretax income, partially 
offset by the resolution of certain tax audits.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business 
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale 
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment 
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other 
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. 
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and 
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the 
interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects 
the safety and soundness of the Firm. 

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, 
among other things: 

• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and 

escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; 

• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and 

management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and 

• Firmwide structures for risk governance. 

The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation 
framework with strong internal governance and 
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the 
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully 
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and 
incentive compensation processes. 

Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight 
framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of 
risks, and impacts of risks.

Refer to pages 85-89 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K 
for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management 
governance and oversight.

44

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or 
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business 
activities and associated risks during normal economic 
environments and under stressed conditions. 

The Firm has been impacted by market events as a result of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, but has remained well-capitalized. 

Refer to pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available 
on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s 
Capital Risk Management, including capital planning and 
stress testing.

Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital 
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and 
internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies 
("BHCs") and banks, including the Firm and its insured 
depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of 
regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is 
determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), 
which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet 
exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive 
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a 
standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an 
advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the 
risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is 
evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or 
Advanced approaches compared to their respective 
minimum capital ratios. 

The Firm’s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are 
currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk-
based ratios. 

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced 
Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to 
calculate the SLR. The Firm’s SLR is currently more binding 
than the Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios. Refer to 
SLR on page 48 for additional information.

Key Regulatory Developments
CECL regulatory capital transition delay. As part of their 
response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provided 
the option beginning January 1, 2020 to delay the effects of 
CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a 

three-year transition period beginning January 1, 2022 
(“CECL capital transition provisions”). 

The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition 
provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended June 30, 
2021, the capital metrics of the Firm exclude $3.8 billion, 
which is the $2.7 billion day 1 impact to retained earnings 
and 25% of the $4.0 billion increase in the allowance for 
credit losses from January 1, 2020 (excluding allowances 
on PCD loans).  

The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have 
also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average 
assets, and total leverage exposure. Refer to Capital Risk 
Management on pages 91-101 and Note 1 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on CECL 
capital transition provisions and the CECL accounting 
guidance.  

PPP. On April 13, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued 
an interim final rule (issued as final on September 29, 
2020) to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of 
participating in the PPP on risk-based capital ratios by 
applying a zero percent risk weight to loans originated 
under the program. The Firm does not expect to realize 
material credit losses on PPP loans, because the loans are 
guaranteed by the SBA. As of June 30, 2021, the Firm had 
approximately $23 billion of loans remaining under the 
program. 

Total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR 
includes PPP loans as the Firm did not participate in the 
Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending 
Facility, which would have allowed the Firm to exclude them 
under the final rule.  

TLAC Holdings rule. On October 20, 2020, the federal 
banking agencies issued a final rule prescribing the 
regulatory capital treatment for holdings of Total Loss-
Absorbing Capacity ("TLAC") debt instruments by certain 
large banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. This rule expands the scope of the existing 
capital deductions rule around the holdings of capital 
instruments of financial institutions to also include TLAC 
debt instruments issued by systemically important banking 
organizations. The final rule became effective April 1, 2021 
and did not have a material impact on the Firm’s risk-based 
capital metrics.

The following tables present the Firm’s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced 
approaches and leverage-based capital metrics. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these capital metrics.

Common stock dividends 
The Firm’s second quarter common stock dividend was 
$0.90 per share. On June 28, 2021, the Firm announced 
that its Board of Directors intends to increase the quarterly 
common stock dividend to $1.00 per share, effective in the 
third quarter of 2021. The Firm’s dividends are subject to 
approval by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.

Common stock
On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced 
that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share 
repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021. 
Subsequently, the Firm announced that its Board of 
Directors authorized a new common share repurchase 
program for up to $30 billion. As directed by the Federal 
Reserve, total net repurchases and common stock dividends 
in the first and second quarters of 2021 were restricted and 
could not exceed the average of the Firm’s net income for 
the four preceding calendar quarters. On March 25, 2021, 
the Federal Reserve extended these restrictions through at 
least the second quarter of 2021. 

On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the 
temporary restrictions on capital distributions would expire 
on June 30, 2021 as a result of the Firm remaining above 
its minimum risk-based capital requirements under the

of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all 
large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases 
through the end of 2020.

Capital planning and stress testing
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
On April 5, 2021, the Firm submitted its 2021 Capital Plan 
to the Federal Reserve under the Federal Reserve’s 2021 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") 
process. On June 28, 2021, JPMorgan Chase announced 
that it had completed the 2021 CCAR stress test process. 
The Firm’s 2021 indicative SCB requirement is 3.2% (down 
from the current 3.3%), which would result in a minimum 
Standardized CET1 capital ratio of 11.2% (down from the 
current 11.3%). The Federal Reserve Board will provide the 
Firm with its final SCB requirement by August 31, 2021, 
and that requirement will become effective on October 1, 
2021, and will remain in effect until September 30, 2022. 

Refer to Capital planning and stress testing on pages 91-92 
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional 
information on CCAR.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet 
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they 
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, 
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support 
its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 102–108 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR 
Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s 
website for a further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk 
Management.

LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is 
sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash 
outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of 
significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible 
HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of 
its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that 
is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded 
from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for both 
the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a 
minimum of 100%. Refer to page 103 of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2020 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports 
for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows.

The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended 
June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020 based

(b) Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS,

(c) Eligible HQLA eligible securities may be reported in securities 

borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or 
investment securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 

that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. 

The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months 
ended June 30, 2021, compared with the three-month 
period ended March 31, 2021, due to an increase in HQLA 
from long-term debt issuances.

The Firm's average LCR decreased during the three months 
ended June 30, 2021, compared with the prior year period 
due to client driven activities in the CIB as well as the 
relative impact on net cash outflows from the significant 
increase in deposits.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR increased during 
the three months ended June 30, 2021, compared with 
both the three month periods ended March 31, 2021 and 
June 30, 2020 primarily due to growth in deposits. Deposits 
continued to increase in the second quarter primarily driven 
by the effect of certain government actions in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in excess liquidity in 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is excluded from the Firm’s 
reported LCR under the LCR rule.

The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR 
fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its 
eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of 
ongoing business activity. 

Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible 
HQLA above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable 
securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm 
believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes 
securities included as part of the excess eligible HQLA at 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to 
non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was 
approximately $854 billion and $740 billion as of June 30, 
2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, although the 
amount of liquidity that could be raised would be 
dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value 
increased compared to December 31, 2020, due to an 
increase in CIB trading assets as well as an increase in 
excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which 
was primarily a result of increased deposits.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the 
Federal Home Loan Banks ("FHLBs") and the discount 
window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral 
pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $297 
billion and $307 billion as of June 30, 2021 and 
December 31, 2020, respectively. This borrowing capacity 
excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the 
Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that 
are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount 
window and other central banks. Although available, the 
Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal 
Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks 
as a primary source of liquidity.

NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity 
requirement for large banking organizations that is 
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” and 
“required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year 
horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies 
issued a final NSFR rule under which large banking 

51

 
organizations such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. will be required to maintain an NSFR of at least 100% 
on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule became effective 
on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required to publicly 
disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually 
beginning in 2023. 

Funding 
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and 
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and 
off-balance sheet obligations.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse 
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and 
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ 
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. may also access funding through short- or long-
term secured borrowings, through the issuance of 

The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are compliant 
with the 100% minimum NSFR, based on the Firm's current 
understanding of the final rule.

unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the 
Parent Company or the Intermediate Holding Company 
(“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily 
funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-
term secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or 
sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is 
invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment 
securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term 
liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity 
risk characteristics.  

Deposits
The table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end deposit balances as of June 30, 2021, and December 31, 
2020, and the average deposit balances for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the 
Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A 
significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer 
deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both 
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale 
operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of 
liquidity because they are generated from customers that 
maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. 

The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the 
loans-to-deposits ratios, and deposits as a percentage of

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are 
generally more representative of deposit trends than 
period-end deposit balances. However, during periods of 
market disruption those trends could be affected.

Average deposits increased for the three and six months 
ended June 30, 2021 compared to the three and six months 
ended June 30, 2020, reflecting significant inflows across 
the LOBs primarily driven by the effect of certain 
government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth from existing 
and new accounts across both consumer and small business 
customers.

2021, from December 31, 2020, and for the average three

notes in CIB Markets.

MMLF.

Short-term funding 
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily 
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to 
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly 
by high-quality securities collateral, including government-
issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. 
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased at 
June 30, 2021, compared with December 31, 2020, 
reflecting the impact of client activities and higher secured 
financing of trading assets in CIB, partially offset by lower 
secured financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury 
and CIO.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to 
investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s 
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix 
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured 
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding consist 
of other borrowed funds and issuance of wholesale 
commercial paper. The decrease in commercial paper at 
June 30, 2021, from December 31, 2020, and for the

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan 
is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term 
funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm 
evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. 

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in 
support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding 
proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes 
long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. 
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–108 and Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional 
information on the IHC and long-term debt.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by 
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an 
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, 
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or 
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors 
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature 
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades 
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, 
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk 
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it 
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential 
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and 
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected 
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to SPEs on page 18, and 
liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 
4 for additional information on the impact of a credit 
ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, 
and on derivatives and collateral agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of June 30, 2021, except 
as noted below, were as follows:

Company’s short-term issuer rating and the Firm's principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries remained unchanged at stable.

(b) On May 24, 2021, Standard & Poor's affirmed the credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries, and 

revised the outlook from stable to positive.

(c) On April 23, 2021, Fitch affirmed the credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries, and revised the 

outlook from negative to stable.

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT 

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the 
default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty 
or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected 
returns on investments, including consumer credit risk,
wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk. Refer to 
Consumer Credit Portfolio, Wholesale Credit Portfolio and 
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 58-74 for a further 
discussion of Credit Risk.

Refer to page 75 for a further discussion of Investment 
Portfolio Risk. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk 
Management on pages 110–134 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 
Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s Credit and 
Investment Risk Management framework.

(b) Represents the net notional amount of protection purchased and sold 
through credit derivatives and credit-related notes used to manage  
credit exposures. Prior-period amount has been revised to conform 
with the current presentation.

(c) At June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, nonperforming assets 
excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by 
U.S. government agencies of $713 million and $874 million, 
respectively, and real estate owned (“REO”) insured by U.S. 
government agencies of $7 million and $9 million, respectively. These 
amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. 
In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans 
from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory 
guidance.

The Firm has provided various forms of assistance to 
customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
including payment deferrals and covenant modifications. 
The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan 
modifications have not been considered troubled debt 
restructurings (“TDRs”). Assistance provided in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of 
delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for 
those customers and clients who would have otherwise 
moved into past due or nonaccrual status. Refer to 
Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 58-62 and Wholesale 
Credit Portfolio on pages 63-72 for information on loan 
modifications as of June 30, 2021. Refer to Notes 12 and 
13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further 
information on the Firm’s accounting policies for loan 
modifications and the allowance for credit losses.

Paycheck Protection Program
The PPP ended on May 31, 2021 for new applications. Since 
inception of the Program, the Firm funded approximately 
$40 billion of loans. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 
2020, the Firm had approximately $23 billion and $27 
billion of loans remaining, respectively, including $17 
billion and $19 billion in the consumer portfolio, 
respectively, and $6 billion and $8 billion in the wholesale 
portfolio, respectively. 

The Firm continues to process forgiveness applications, and 
through June 30, 2021, approximately $18 billion of loans 
were forgiven by the SBA. This resulted in accelerated 
recognition of the associated deferred processing fees in 
interest income, primarily in CCB.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 23-27 and Credit 
Portfolio on page 113 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-
K for a further discussion on the PPP.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO 

Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change 
in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer.

In the following tables, reported loans include loans 
retained (i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale; and 
certain loans accounted for at fair value. The following 
tables do not include loans which the Firm accounts for at 
fair value and classifies as trading assets; refer to Notes 2

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans, scored auto and 
business banking loans, as well as associated lending-related commitments. The Firm’s focus is on serving primarily the prime 
segment of the consumer credit market. The macroeconomic environment continued to improve in the first half of 2021, with 
the credit performance of the consumer portfolio, including net charge-offs, benefiting from government stimulus programs, 
payment deferral programs and increasing home prices. Refer to Note 11 of this Form 10-Q; and Consumer Credit Portfolio on 
pages 114-120 and Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on consumer loans, as well as the 
Firm’s nonaccrual and charge-off accounting policies. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q and Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 
Form 10-K for further information on lending-related commitments.

(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in Corporate.
(b) At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, excluded operating lease assets of $19.3 billion and $20.6 billion, respectively. These operating lease assets are 

included in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 16 for further information.

(c) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(d) At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, included $16.7 billion and $19.2 billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP. The Firm does 
not expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans, because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 57 for a further 
discussion of the PPP.

(e) Includes scored mortgage loans held in CCB and CIB.
(f) Credit card, home equity and certain business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available lines of credit for these products. The Firm 
has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain 
conditions are met, home equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing 
the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 22 for further information.

(g) Includes billed interest and fees.
(h) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.
(i) Represents the notional amount of protection obtained through the issuance of credit-related notes that reference certain pools of residential real estate and 

auto loans in the retained consumer portfolio.

(j) At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of 
$713 million and $874 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In addition, 
the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(k) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited 
COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent at time of exit 
from COVID-19 payment deferral programs and charged down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.
(l) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $27.0 billion and $16.3 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, 

respectively, and were $24.2 billion and $19.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts were excluded when 
calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates.

Consumer assistance
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly in the 
form of payment deferrals.
As of June 30, 2021, the Firm had $5.9 billion of retained loans under payment deferral programs, which represented a 
decrease of approximately $22.4 billion from June 30, 2020. During the second quarter of 2021, there were approximately 
$386 million of new enrollments in payment deferral programs predominantly in residential real estate and credit card. 
Predominantly all borrowers that exited payment deferral programs are current. The Firm continues to monitor the credit risk 
associated with loans subject to payment deferrals throughout the deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers 
are required to resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest on 
these loans in its allowance for credit losses.

The weighted average LTV ratio of residential real estate loans under payment deferral at June 30, 2021 was 51%.
Excludes risk-rated business banking and auto dealer loans held in CCB and auto operating lease assets that were still under payment deferral programs. 
Auto operating lease asset payment assistance is currently offering one month payment deferral (initially offered three month payment deferral). Deferrals 
do not extend the term of the lease and all deferred payments are due at the end of the lease term.
(d)
Includes $2.6 billion and $5.7 billion of loans that were accounted for as TDRs prior to payment deferral as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(e) Represents the unpaid principal balance of retained loans which were still under payment deferral programs, divided by the total unpaid principal balance 

of the respective loan classes retained loans.
93% of the balance that exited deferral were current at June 30, 2021.

(f)

Of the $5.9 billion of loans still under payment deferral programs as of June 30, 2021, approximately $2.8 billion were 
accounted for as TDRs, either because they were accounted for as TDRs prior to payment deferral, or because they did not qualify 
for or the Firm did not elect the option to suspend TDR accounting guidance provided by the CARES Act and extended by the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act.

Predominantly all borrowers, including those with loans accounted for as TDRs, were current upon enrollment in payment 
deferral programs and are expected to exit payment deferral programs in a current status, either because no payments are 
contractually due during the deferral period or because payments originally contractually due during the deferral period will be 
due at maturity upon exit. For those borrowers that are unable to resume or continue making payments in accordance with the 
original or modified contractual terms of their agreements upon exit from deferral programs, they will be placed on nonaccrual 
status in line with the Firm’s nonaccrual policy, except for credit cards as permitted by regulatory guidance, and charged off or 
down in accordance with the Firm’s charge-off policies. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for additional 
information on the Firm’s nonaccrual and charge-off policies.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loan balances increased from December 31, 2020 driven 
by higher residential real estate loans at fair value as well 
as an increase in auto and other, partially offset by lower 
retained residential real estate loans.

Residential real estate: The residential real estate 
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and 
home equity lines of credit.

Retained loans declined from December 31, 2020 due to 
paydowns outpacing originations of prime mortgage loans 
in Home Lending, partially offset by growth in AWM. 
Retained nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 
2020 reflecting improved credit performance. Net 
recoveries for the three months ended June 30, 2021 were 
higher when compared with the same period in the prior 
year as the current year had a greater benefit from 
improved HPI and reversals of prior write-downs due to 
loan prepayments as a result of the low rate environment. 
Net recoveries for the six months ended June 30, 2021 
were relatively flat when compared with the same period in 
the prior year as the current year had a greater benefit 
from improved HPI and reversals of prior write-downs due 
to loan prepayments, while the prior year included a 
recovery on a loan sale.
Loans at fair value increased from December 31, 2020, 
reflecting loan purchase activity in CIB driven by higher 
client demand, as well as increased originations in Home 
Lending due to the continued low rate environment and 
seasonality. Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased from 
December 31, 2020 largely due to sales in CIB.
The carrying value of home equity lines of credit 
outstanding was $20.9 billion at June 30, 2021. This 
amount included $8.2 billion of HELOCs that have recast 
from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have 
been modified and $7.0 billion of interest-only balloon 
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm 
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by 
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent 
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material 
deterioration in their credit risk profile.

At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying 
value of interest-only residential mortgage loans were 
$26.5 billion and $25.6 billion, respectively. These loans 
have an interest-only payment period generally followed by 
an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment 
period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-
balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly 
in AWM. Net recoveries and charge-offs for the three and 
six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, were not 
material, as the credit performance of this portfolio is 
generally in line with the performance of the broader prime 
mortgage portfolio.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s 
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed 
by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-
sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure 
to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related 
to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in 
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered concessions and, 
therefore, are not TDRs, or loans for which the Firm has 
elected to apply the option to suspend the application of 
accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act 
and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Refer 
to Note 11 for further information on modifications for the 
three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.

(a) At both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, $7 million of loans 
modified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae in accordance 
with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., Federal 
Housing Administration (“FHA”), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 
(“VA”), Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(“RHS”)) are not included in the table above. When such loans perform 
subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, 
they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans 
that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure. Refer to Note 
13 for additional information about sales of loans in securitization 
transactions with Ginnie Mae.

(b) At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans included 
$3.1 billion and $3.0 billion of TDRs for which the borrowers were less 
than 90 days past due. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 
Form 10-K for additional information about loans modified in a TDR 
that are on nonaccrual status.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, 
including loans at fair value, predominantly consists of 
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as 
well as overdrafts. The portfolio increased when compared 
with December 31, 2020 due to growth in the auto 
portfolio from loan originations, predominantly offset by 
paydowns and charge-offs or liquidation of delinquent loans 
and a decrease in Business Banking loans due to PPP loan 
forgiveness net of loan originations. The scored auto 
portfolio net recovery and charge-off rates were (0.11)% 
and 0.39% for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 
2020, respectively, and 0.00% and 0.40% for the six 
months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Auto 
charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 
2021 benefited from government stimulus, payment 
assistance programs, and high vehicle collateral values.

(a) At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, loans under payment 
deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic 
which are still within their deferral period and performing according to 
their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.
(b) Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 payment 

deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly 
all of which were considered collateral-dependent at time of exit from 
COVID-19 payment deferral programs and charged down to the lower 
of amortized cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to 
sell.

Credit card
Total credit card loans decreased from December 31, 2020 
reflecting higher payments, predominantly offset by strong 
sales volume in the second quarter. The June 30, 2021 30+ 
and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.01% and 0.54%, 
respectively, decreased compared to the December 31, 
2020 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.68% and 
0.92%, respectively. The delinquency rates were positively 
impacted by government stimulus and borrowers who 
participated in payment assistance programs. Net charge-
offs decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 
2021 compared with the same period in the prior year 
reflecting lower charge-offs and higher recoveries as 
consumer cash balances remained elevated benefiting from 
the ongoing impact of government stimulus and payment 
assistance programs.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans 
typically remain on accrual status until charged off. 
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the 
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed 
interest and fee income. Refer to Note 11 for further 
information about this portfolio, including information 
about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and 
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.

Modifications of credit card loans
At June 30, 2021, the Firm had $1.2 billion of credit card 
loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, which 
does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered TDRs, compared to 
$1.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 11 for 
additional information about loan modification programs to 
borrowers.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO 

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit 
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-
making, and hedging activities with and for clients and 
counterparties, as well as through various operating 
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), 
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A 
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s 
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance 
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the 
loans that it originates into the market as part of its 
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio 
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is 
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth 
reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure 
inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, 
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry 
discussion on pages 65-69 for further information.

The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held 
in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated 
exposures held in CCB, including business banking and auto 
dealer exposure for which the wholesale methodology is 
applied when determining the allowance for credit losses.

In the first half of 2021, the credit environment continued 
to improve following the broad-based deterioration in 2020 
that resulted from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

As of June 30, 2021, retained loans increased $9.9 billion 
driven by CIB and AWM largely offset by decreases in CB 
and CCB. Lending related commitments increased $52.8 
billion, predominantly driven by net portfolio activity in CIB 
and CB, including an increase in held for sale commitments 
intended to be syndicated.

In the six months ended June 30, 2021, the investment- 
grade percentage of the credit portfolio decreased from 
71% to 70% driven by net portfolio activity, including new 
commitments. Criticized exposure increased $3.4 billion 
from $41.6 billion at December 31, 2020 to $45.0 billion 
at June 30, 2021, driven by select downgrades, largely 
offset by select upgrades and net portfolio activity. 
Nonperforming exposure remained flat at $4.9 billion and 
net charge off activity was $63 million.

(a) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans 

to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM; these are reported within 
accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated balance 
sheets.

(b) Represents the net notional amount of protection purchased and sold 
through credit derivatives and credit-related notes used to manage 
both performing and nonperforming wholesale credit exposures; these 
derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. Refer 
to Credit derivatives on page 72 and Note 4 for additional information. 
Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current 
presentation.

(c) Loans that were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic 

continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit 
risk management framework. As of June 30, 2021, predominantly all 
of these loans were considered performing.

Wholesale assistance 
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to clients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly in the 
form of payment deferrals and covenant modifications.
As of June 30, 2021, the Firm had approximately $460 million of retained loans still under payment deferral, representing 
0.1% of the loan portfolio, which decreased from $16.8 billion at June 30, 2020. Predominantly all clients that exited deferral 
are current or have paid down their loans, and the Firm has not experienced meaningful new payment deferral requests. The 
Firm continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to deferrals throughout the deferral period and on an 
ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers expected losses 
of principal and accrued interest on these loans in its allowance for credit losses.

In addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of covenant modifications. These types of assistance, both payment 
deferrals and covenant modifications, are generally not reported as TDRs, either because the modifications were insignificant 
or they qualified for the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and 
extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Loans under assistance continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the 
Firm’s overall credit risk management framework. As of June 30, 2021, predominantly all of these loans were considered 
performing.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile
The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of June 30, 
2021, and December 31, 2020. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to 
BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when determining the 
internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on 
internal risk ratings.

Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at June 30, 2021, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes 
in market conditions.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries 
with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the 
special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, was $45.0 billion at June 30, 2021, compared with $41.6 billion at December 31, 2020, representing approximately 
4.1% and 4.0% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. The increase in total criticized exposure was driven by select 
downgrades, largely offset by select upgrades and net portfolio activity. The total criticized exposure at June 30, 2021 was 
largely undrawn and $40.9 billion was performing.

Services as shown in the table below. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, the investment-grade percentage 
decreased from 47% to 41%, predominantly driven by increased derivative receivables resulting from market movements.  
However, criticized exposure decreased by $1.2 billion from $5.7 billion at December 31, 2020 to $4.5 billion at June 30, 
2021, driven by select upgrades and net portfolio activity, largely offset by select downgrades.

Loans
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a 
variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and 
institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. Refer to 
Note 11 for a further discussion on loans, including 
information about delinquencies, loan modifications and 
other credit quality indicators.

The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual 
loan portfolio for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 
2020. Since June 30, 2020, nonaccrual loan exposure 
decreased $658 million, driven by net portfolio activity and 
select upgrades across multiple industries including Oil & 
Gas, partially offset by select downgrades in Real Estate.

Lending-related commitments 
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as 
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and 
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. 
The contractual amounts of these financial instruments 
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the 
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm 
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the 
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms 
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and 
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, 
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default 
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the 
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related 
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected 
future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to 
Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending-
related commitments.

Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment 
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that 
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ 
brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and readily 
marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this 
collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally 
held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the 
Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the 
required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires 
clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to 
reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are 
reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on 
the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage 
risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations 
in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, and 
commodities. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in 
order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage 
certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its 
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit 
risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses 
derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and 
other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty 
and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the 
credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives 
the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative 
counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), 
such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter 
(“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed 
to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the 
Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from 
derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable 
master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. 

The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative 
transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding 
foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically 
covered by collateral agreements due to their short 
maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily 
— was approximately 88% at both June 30, 2021, and 
December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 4 for additional 
information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements. 
Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of derivative 
contracts, counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets were $70.7 billion and $79.6 
billion at June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, 
respectively, with decreases in CIB resulting from market 
movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value 
of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally 
enforceable master netting agreements and the related 
cash collateral held by the Firm. 

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash 
collateral that the Firm believes is legally enforceable and 
may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s 
exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For the purpose of this 
disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent 
with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in 
the LCR rule. 

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current 
credit risk should also take into consideration other 
collateral, which generally represents securities that do not 
qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule, but 
that the Firm believes is legally enforceable. The collateral 
amounts for each counterparty are limited to the net 
derivative receivables for the counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 
government securities, other liquid government agency and 
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity 
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of 
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that 
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm 
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the 
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the 
balances and is not included in the tables below, it is 
available as security against potential exposure that could 
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative 
contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 4 for 
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral 
agreements.

Credit portfolio management activities
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: 
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an 
end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated 
with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related 
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the 
Firm’s wholesale businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains 
credit protection against certain loans in the retained 
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-related 
notes. Information on credit portfolio management 
activities is provided in the table below.

Refer to Note 13  and Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 
Form 10-K for a description of the policies, methodologies 
and judgments used to determine the Firm’s allowances for 
credit losses on loans, lending-related commitments, and 
investment securities.

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on 
pages 84-86 for further information on the allowance for 
credit losses and related management judgments.

credit portfolios.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses comprises:

• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is 
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,

• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is 
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts 
payable and other liabilities, and

• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is 
reflected within Investment Securities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2021 
decreased when compared to December 31, 2020, 
consisting of:

• a $7.1 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in 

the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the 
Firm's economic outlook; and in the residential real 
estate portfolio, primarily due to continued 
improvements in HPI expectations, and

• a $1.1 billion net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs, 
reflecting improvements in the Firm's economic outlook.  

The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many macroeconomic 
variables (“MEVs”) used in the Firm's allowance estimate 
which has created challenges in the use of modeled credit 
loss estimates, increased the reliance on management 
judgment, and resulted in adjustments to appropriately 
address the economic circumstances. These adjustments 
continued through the second quarter of 2021, although to 
a lesser extent than experienced during 2020.

The U.S. economy has continued to improve with the 
benefits of vaccination and as more businesses have 
reopened, thereby reducing certain pandemic-related 
macroeconomic uncertainties. However, uncertainties 
remain, including the pace of vaccination progress, the 
impact of additional waves and new virus strains, the health 
of underlying labor markets, and the potential for changes 
in consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts 
on certain sectors. As a result of these uncertainties, the 
Firm retained meaningful weighting on its adverse 
scenarios, albeit to a lesser extent than the first quarter of 
2021 and fourth quarter of 2020. The adverse scenarios 
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the 
central case assumptions outlined below, resulting in 
weighted average U.S. unemployment rates rising above 
seven percent in 2021 and falling just below six percent 
throughout the second quarter of 2022 with U.S. gross

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss 
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on 
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio 
or from principal investments. The investment securities 
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in 
connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability 
management objectives. Principal investments are 
predominantly privately-held non-traded financial 
instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. 
Investments are typically intended to be held over extended 
periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for 
short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk 
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated 
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This 
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities 
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly 
invested in high-quality securities. At June 30, 2021, the 
Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of 
allowance for credit losses, was $571.6 billion, and the 
average credit rating of the securities comprising the 
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where 
available and where not available, based primarily upon 
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on 
pages 42-43 and Note 9 for further information on the 
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. 
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 76-80 for 
further information on the market risk inherent in the 
portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
51-55 for further information on related liquidity risk.

Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically privately held non-
traded financial instruments representing ownership or 
other forms of junior capital and span multiple asset 
classes. These investments are made by dedicated investing 
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. In 
general, principal investments include tax-oriented 
investments and investments made to enhance or 
accelerate the Firm’s business strategies. The Firm’s 
investments will continue to evolve in line with its 
strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to support 
underserved communities and minority-owned businesses. 
The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs 
and Corporate and are reflected within their respective 
financial results. The aggregate carrying values of the 
principal investment portfolios have not been significantly 
affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of 
the principal investment portfolios as June 30, 2021 and

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes 
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange 
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or 
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held 
for both the short and long term. Refer to Market Risk 
Management on pages 135–142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 
Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk 
Management organization, market risk measurement, risk 
monitoring and control, and predominant business activities 
that give rise to market risk. 

Market Risk Management continues to actively monitor the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk exposures 
by leveraging existing risk measures and controls.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently 
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain 
risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be 
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market 
conditions occur. For additional discussion on model 
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 83.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s 
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for 
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate 
those measures accordingly over time. 

Value-at-risk 
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical 
risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse 
market moves in the current market environment. The Firm 
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating 
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.  

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a 
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss 
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. 
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this 
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely 
aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs 
and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, 
provides the appropriate information needed to respond to 
risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily 
aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules 
(“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s 
regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. 

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling 
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such 
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. 
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 
151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for information 
regarding model reviews and approvals.

Refer to page 137 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K 
for further information regarding VaR, including the 
inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk 
Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan 
Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures 
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for 
additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other 
components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm 
(e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and 
the respective backtesting). Refer to Other risk measures on 
pages 140-142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for 
further information regarding nonstatistical market risk 
measures used by the Firm.

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature 

of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.  

(b) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification 

benefit is not meaningful.

(c) Average and maximum Corporate and other LOB VaR for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were driven by a private equity position that became 

publicly traded at the end of the third quarter of 2020. As of March 31, 2021 the Firm no longer held this position.

Quarter over quarter results
Average total VaR decreased by $63 million for the three 
months ended June 30, 2021 when compared with March 
31, 2021. This decrease was driven by volatility which 
occurred at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic rolling out 
of the one-year historical look back period, largely 
impacting exposures in fixed income and equities.

Year over year results
Average total VaR decreased by $87 million for the three 
months ended June 30, 2021, compared with the same 
period in the prior year. This decrease was driven by 
volatility which occurred at the onset of the COVID-19 
pandemic rolling out of the one-year historical look back 
period, predominantly impacting exposure in fixed income.

Effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to 
exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected 
loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based 
measures to more effectively measure the risk from these 
loans. In the absence of this refinement, the average Total 
VaR and each of the components would have been different 
by the amounts reported in the following table:

decreased by $87 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, compared with the same period in the prior year. Daily 
Risk Management VaR has also declined from March 31, 2020, returning to near pre-pandemic levels, as the volatility which 
occurred in late March of 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has rolled out of the one-year historical look-back 
period.

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains 
and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the 
Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of 
new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain 
valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset 
backtesting gains and losses on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the 
requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.
For the 12 months ended June 30, 2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 157 of the 259 days, and observed four VaR 
backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended June 30, 2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 30 of the 65 days, 
and observed four VaR backtesting exceptions.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and 
three months ended June 30, 2021. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily Risk 
Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. A 
backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. 
Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart 
below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory 
Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and 
other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s 
interest rate exposure, the earnings at risk analysis does 
not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income

The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of 
June 30, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 reflected 
updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher long-term rates as 
well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet.

The Firm’s sensitivity to rates is primarily a result of assets 
repricing at a faster pace than deposits.
Based upon current and implied market rates as of June 30, 
2021, scenarios reflecting lower rates could result in 
negative interest rates. The U.S. has never experienced an 
interest rate environment where the Federal Reserve has a 
negative interest rate policy. In a negative interest rate 
environment, the modeling assumptions used for certain 
assets and liabilities require additional management 
judgment and therefore, the actual outcomes may differ 
from these assumptions.

The results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario 
involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising 
by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current 
levels were not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at 
June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported 
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one 
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk 
arises not only from trading activities but also from the 
Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include 
extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and 
issuing debt as well as from the investment securities 
portfolio. Refer to the table on page 136 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and 
Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.

One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk 
is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the 
Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate 
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which 
includes net interest income and certain interest rate 
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and 
in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm 
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest 
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. 
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). 
These simulations primarily include retained loans, 
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-
term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds 
transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR 
and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 
136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to 
a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 
months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios 
include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term 
and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield 
curve involving holding short-term rates constant and 
increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve 
involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term 
rates constant. These scenarios consider many different 
factors, including:

• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous 

changes in interest rates from baseline rates.

• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled 

prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not 
include assumptions about actions that could be taken by 
the Firm or its clients and customers in response to any 
such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment 
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the 
scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, 
the time since origination, and other factors which are 
updated periodically based on historical experience.

• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit 

betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid 
could change upon a given change in market interest 
rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios may differ 
from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and 
other factors.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed 
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political 
or other significant developments which adversely affect 
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular 
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management 
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be 
impacted by these developments and measures the extent 
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the 
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Country Risk Management continues to monitor the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic on individual countries.

Refer to pages 143-144 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk 
management.

Risk Reporting
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2021 and their 
comparative exposures as of December 31, 2020. The 
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total 
exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s 
internal country risk management approach, and does not 
represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially 
adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate 
from period to period due to client activity and market 
flows.

The increase in exposure to Australia was due to increased 
cash placements with the central bank of Australia, driven 
by client activity following policy decisions in the country 
and growth in client deposits.

Cybersecurity Risk
Due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19, the Firm continues 
to leverage use of remote access and video conferencing 
solutions provided by third parties to facilitate remote 
work. As a result, the Firm has deployed additional 
precautionary measures to mitigate cybersecurity risks.

Payment Fraud Risk
The risk of payment fraud remains at a heightened level 
across the industry, particularly during the COVID-19 
pandemic due to the use of contingent forms of payment 
authentication methods and the perpetuation of scams 
involving the pandemic, including an increase in the level of 
fraud attempts against consumers. The complexities of 
these incidents and the strategies used by perpetrators 
continue to evolve. The Firm employs various controls for 
managing payment fraud risk as well as providing employee 
and client education and awareness trainings. 

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; 
human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s 
processes or systems; Operational Risk includes 
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. 
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can 
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, 
business interruptions, cyber attacks, inappropriate 
employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws 
and regulations or failure of vendors to perform in 
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk 
Management attempts to manage operational risk at 
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, 
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and 
regulatory environments in which it operates. Refer to 
Operational Risk Management on pages 145-147 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the 
Firm’s Operational Risk Management.

Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. 
Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance risk, 
Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk as 
well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are 
captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement 
processes. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page 
148, Conduct Risk Management on page 149, Legal Risk 
Management on page 150 and Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K for more information. Details on other select examples 
of operational risks are provided below.

Business and technology resiliency risk
Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the 
Firm’s control such as the spread of infectious diseases or 
pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications 
loss, accidents, failure of a third party to provide expected 
services, cyberattack, flooding, transit strikes, terrorism 
and health emergencies. The safety of the Firm’s employees 
and customers is of the highest priority. The Firmwide 
resiliency program is intended to enable the Firm to recover 
its critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., 
staff, technology and facilities) in the event of a business 
interruption. The program includes governance, awareness 
training, and testing of recovery strategies, as well as 
strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and 
manage business interruption and public safety risks. The 
strength and proficiency of the Firmwide resiliency program 
has played an integral role in maintaining the Firm’s 
business operations during and after various events.

82

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT

Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational 
risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from 
decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs.

The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment- 
based estimations across various businesses and functions. 
The estimation methods are of varying levels of 
sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the 
valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing 
regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, 
and making business decisions.

While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of 
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market 
or economic environment. This is particularly true when the 
current and forecasted environment is significantly 
different from the historical macroeconomic environments 
upon which the models were trained, as the Firm has 
experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This 
uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment 
and analytics to inform adjustments to model outputs than 
in typical periods.   

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on 
pages 84-86 and Note 2 of this Form 10-Q, and Estimations 
and Model Risk Management section on page 151 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary of 
model-based valuations and other valuation techniques.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM 

JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates 
are integral to understanding its reported results. The 
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require 
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate 
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has 
established policies and control procedures intended to 
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments 
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, 
independently reviewed and applied consistently from 
period to period. The methods used and judgments made 
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or 
liabilities and the related business and risk management 
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are 
intended to ensure that the process for changing 
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm 
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of 
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a 
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates 
involving significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 

retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 

which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant 
judgment on a number of matters including development 
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of 
historical loss experience, assessment of risk 
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of 
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected 
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 
2020 Form 10-K for further information on these 
judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies 
used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; 
and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 73-74 and 
Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in 
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to 
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses 
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s 
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates 
hundreds of MEVs that are relevant for exposures across 
the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily 
by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific 
variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled 
losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S. 

unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real 
GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate 
credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices 
and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of 
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of 
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet 
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one 
reporting period to the next.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a weak labor market 
and weak overall economic conditions that affected 
borrowers across the Firm’s consumer and wholesale 
lending portfolios. The U.S. economy has continued to 
improve with the benefits of vaccination and as more 
businesses have reopened, thereby reducing certain 
pandemic-related macroeconomic uncertainties.  However, 
uncertainties remain, including the pace of vaccination 
progress, the impact of additional waves and new virus 
strains, the health of underlying labor markets, and the 
potential for changes in consumer behavior that could have 
longer term impacts on certain sectors. Further, judgment 
is still required to estimate the speed and trajectory of the 
economic recovery. 

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one 
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit 
losses because management considers a wide variety of 
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit 
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may 
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across 
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors 
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that 
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration 
in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate 
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled 
credit losses determined using its central and relative 
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five 
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan 
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and 
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of 
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of 
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario 
described on page 73 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative 
adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S. 
unemployment rate through 2021, averaging 
approximately 2.4% higher over the eight-quarter forecast, 
with a peak difference of approximately 4.2% in the fourth 
quarter of 2021; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower 
recovery, remaining nearly 2.5% lower at the end of the 
eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of 
approximately 6.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021; and 

84

lower national HPI with a peak difference of nearly 11.2% 
and forecasted trough, both in the third quarter of 2022.

estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and 
appropriate for the period ended June 30, 2021.

Fair value  
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including, 
derivatives, structured note products and certain securities 
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including 
certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the 
carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying 
collateral.

Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at 
fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified 
within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for 
further information.

For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total 
reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $6.5 billion 
of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the 
netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation 
based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The 
level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including 
the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future 
changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of 
reasons, including:

• the Firm continues to place meaningful weighting on its 
adverse scenarios in estimating its allowance for credit 
losses as of June 30, 2021, and accordingly, the existing 
allowance already reflects credit losses beyond those 
estimated under the central scenario

• the impacts of changes in many MEVs are both 

interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis 
cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes 
in macroeconomic variables

• the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in 

the Firm's allowance estimate, which has created 
challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimations 

• significant changes in the expected severity and duration 

of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic, effects of government support and customer 
assistance, and speed and trajectory of the subsequent 
recovery could significantly affect the Firm’s estimate of 
expected credit losses irrespective of the estimated 
sensitivities described below.

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to 
macroeconomic forecasts as of June 30, 2021, the Firm 
compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse 
scenario to its central scenario. Without considering the 
additional weight the Firm has placed on its adverse 
scenarios or any other offsetting or correlated effects in 
other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for 
credit losses for these lending exposures, the comparison 
between these two scenarios reflects the following 
differences:

• An increase of approximately $300 million for residential 

real estate loans and lending-related commitments

• An increase of approximately $2.8 billion for credit card 

loans

• An increase of approximately $1.7 billion for wholesale 

loans and lending-related commitments

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss 
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the 
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any 
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative 
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment 
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates 
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled 
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances 
and conditions.

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are 
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent 
economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to 
consider the available information and associated risks and 
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its

Goodwill impairment
Management applies significant judgment when testing 
goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each 
business combination is allocated to the related reporting 
units for goodwill impairment testing. Refer to Goodwill 
impairment on page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K for a description of the significant valuation judgments 
associated with goodwill impairment.

Credit card rewards liability
The credit card rewards liability was $8.3 billion and $7.7 
billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, 
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other 
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to page 
154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description 
of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, associated 
with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability.

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. 
The type and level of judgment required is largely 
dependent on the amount of observable market information 
available to the Firm. For instruments valued using 
internally developed valuation models and other valuation 
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are 
therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation 
hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more 
significant than those required when estimating the fair 
value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to 
use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant 
inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical 
data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, 
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment 
speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such 
as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of 
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit 
curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the 
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable 
inputs used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management 
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of 
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, 
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity 
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios 
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk 
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the 
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the 
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a 
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and 
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider 
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for 
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further 
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or 
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded 
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm 
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with those of other market participants, the 
methods and assumptions used reflect management 
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in 
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or 
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could 
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting 
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s 
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of 
fair value for individual financial instruments.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS

Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Standards Adopted since January 1, 2021

Standard

Summary of guidance 

Effects on financial statements

• Issued and effective March 12, 2020. The January 

7, 2021 update was effective when issued. 

• The Firm elected to apply certain of the practical 
expedients related to contract modifications and 
hedge accounting relationships, and discounting 
transition beginning in the third quarter of 2020. 
The discounting transition election was applied 
retrospectively. The main purpose of the practical 
expedients is to ease the administrative burden of 
accounting for contracts impacted by reference rate 
reform. These elections did not have a material 
impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reference Rate
Reform

Issued March
2020 and 
updated 
January 2021

• Provides optional expedients and exceptions to 
current accounting guidance when financial 
instruments, hedge accounting relationships, and 
other transactions are amended due to reference 
rate reform.

• Provides an election to account for certain 

contract amendments related to reference rate 
reform as modifications rather than 
extinguishments without the requirement to 
assess the significance of the amendments.  

• Allows for changes in critical terms of a hedge 
accounting relationship without automatic 
termination of that relationship. Provides various 
practical expedients and elections designed to 
allow hedge accounting to continue uninterrupted 
during the transition period.  

• Provides a one-time election to transfer securities 
out of the held-to-maturity classification if certain 
criteria are met.

• The January 2021 update provides an election to 
account for derivatives modified to change the 
rate used for discounting, margining, or contract 
price alignment (collectively “discounting 
transition”) as modifications.
