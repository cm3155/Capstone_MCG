The following discussion supplements the discussion of risk 

factors affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A: 

Risk Factors on pages 8-32 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. The discussion of risk factors, as so supplemented, sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is causing significant harm to the global economy and could further negatively affect certain of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s businesses. 

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic led to the institution of social distancing and shelter-in-place requirements in certain areas of the U.S. and other countries resulting in ongoing severe impacts on global economic conditions, including: 

&#8226; significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets 

&#8226; significant disruption of global supply chains, and 

&#8226; closures of many businesses, leading to loss of revenues and increased unemployment. 

A prolongation or worsening of the pandemic, or the emergence of other diseases that give rise to similar effects, could deepen the adverse impact on the global economy. 

The adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic have had a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s businesses and results of operations, including: 

&#8226; reduction in demand for certain products and services from JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s clients and customers, resulting in lower revenue, and 

&#8226; increases in the allowance for credit losses. 

Certain models used by JPMorgan Chase in connection with the determination of the allowance for credit losses have heightened performance risk in the economic environment precipitated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and government stimulus. There can be no assurance that, even after adjustments have been made to model outputs, JPMorgan Chase will not recognize unexpected losses arising from the model uncertainty that has resulted from these developments. 

A prolongation or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative economic impacts of the pandemic could have other significant adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, including: 

&#8226; recognition of credit losses and further increases in the allowance for credit losses, especially to the extent that businesses remain closed, unemployment continues at elevated levels, clients and customers draw on their lines of credit or significant numbers of people relocate from metropolitan areas 

&#8226; material impacts on the value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets 

&#8226; downgrades in JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s credit ratings 

&#8226; constraints on liquidity or capital due to elevated levels of deposits, increases in risk-weighted assets (&#8220;RWA&#8221;) related to supporting client activities, downgrades in client credit ratings, regulatory actions or other factors, any or all of which could require JPMorgan Chase to take or refrain from taking actions that it otherwise would under its liquidity and capital management strategies, and 

&#8226; the possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic. 

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness of vaccination programs and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. Those negative effects, including the possible recognition of charge-offs, may be delayed 

because of the impact of prior and potential future government stimulus actions or payment assistance provided to clients and customers. 

In addition, JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s participation directly or indirectly, including on behalf of customers and clients or by affiliated entities, in U.S. government programs designed to support individuals, households and businesses impacted by the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could be criticized and subject JPMorgan Chase to: 

&#8226; increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny 

&#8226; negative publicity, and 

&#8226; increased exposure to litigation, 

any or all of which could increase JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s operational, legal and compliance costs and damage its reputation. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in Risk Factors in the 2020 Form 10-K.
