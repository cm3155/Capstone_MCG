(a) The capital metrics reflect the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition
provisions. For the period ended March 31, 2021, the SLR reflected the
temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal
Reserve Banks. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 35-40 of this
Form 10-Q and pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
additional information.

(b) NII and NIR refer to net interest income and noninterest revenue, respectively.

Markets consists of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets
businesses.

Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the first quarter of
2022 versus the first quarter of 2021, unless otherwise specified.

Firmwide overview
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $8.3 billion for the first
quarter of 2022, or $2.63 per share, on net revenue of $30.7
billion. The Firm reported ROE of 13% and ROTCE of 16%. The
Firm's results for the first quarter of 2022 included a net increase in
the allowance for credit losses of $902 million and a loss of $524
million in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB.

• The Firm had net income of $8.3 billion, down 42%.

• Total net revenue was down 5%.

– Noninterest revenue was $16.8 billion, down 13%, driven by
lower Investment Banking fees, lower net production revenue
in Home Lending, and losses on legacy equity investments
compared to gains in the prior year in Corporate. The
decrease also reflected the loss in Credit Adjustments & Other
in CIB.

– Net interest income was $13.9 billion, up 8%. Net interest

income excluding Markets was $11.8 billion, up 9%,
predominantly driven by balance sheet growth and higher
rates, partially offset by lower NII from Paycheck Protection
Program ("PPP") loans.

• Noninterest expense was $19.2 billion, up 2%, predominantly

driven by investments and structural expense across the LOBs,
largely offset by lower volume- and revenue-related expense,
including revenue-related compensation in CIB. The prior-year
expense included a $550 million contribution to the Firm’s
Foundation.

• The provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion, driven by;
– a net addition of $902 million to the allowance for credit

losses, which largely reflects an increased weight placed on
the adverse scenarios, from the more balanced weighting
placed on the adverse and upside scenarios at December 31,
2021, due to the potential effects associated with higher
inflation, changes in monetary policy, as well as geopolitical
risks, including the war in Ukraine. The increase in the
allowance also included client-specific Russia and Russia-
associated downgrades in CIB and AWM, and

– $582 million of net charge-offs, down $475 million, driven by

Card.

The prior year provision was a net benefit of $4.2 billion,
reflecting a net reduction in the allowance for credit losses of
$5.2 billion.

• The total allowance for credit losses was $19.6 billion at March

31, 2022. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained
loans coverage ratio of 1.69%, compared with 2.42% in the prior
year.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $8.6 billion at March
31, 2022, a net decrease of $1.7 billion from the prior year,
driven by lower nonaccrual loans, reflecting improved credit
performance in consumer; and in wholesale, net portfolio activity
as well as client-specific upgrades, largely offset by client-
specific downgrades, including Russia and Russia-associated
clients.

• Firmwide average loans of $1.1 trillion were up 5%, driven by

higher loans in AWM and CIB.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.5 trillion were up 13%,

reflecting inflows across the LOBs primarily driven by the
ongoing effect of certain government actions. In CCB, the
increase was also driven by growth from new and existing

Outlook
These current expectations are forward-looking statements within
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the current
beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management,
speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q, and are subject to
significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking
Statements on page 79 and page 155 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021
Form 10-K for a further discussion of certain of those risks and
uncertainties and the other factors that could cause JPMorgan
Chase’s actual results to differ materially because of those risks
and uncertainties. There is no assurance that actual results will be
in line with the outlook information set forth below, and the Firm
does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for 2022 should be viewed
against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, the
COVID-19 pandemic, financial markets activity, the geopolitical
environment, the competitive environment, client and customer
activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the
U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of
these factors will affect the performance of the Firm. The Firm will
continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and
operations in response to ongoing developments in the business,
economic, regulatory and legal environments in which it operates.

Full-year 2022
• Management expects net interest income excluding Markets to

be in excess of $53 billion, market dependent.

• Management expects adjusted expense to be approximately $77

billion, which includes increased investments in technology,
distribution and marketing, and higher structural expense.

Net interest income excluding Markets and adjusted expense are
non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to Explanation and
Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
on pages 15-16.

Providing humanitarian assistance
In support of the relief efforts, the Firm has made a $10 million
commitment to help address the Ukrainian humanitarian crisis.

Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, on pages 9-33 of the
JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of risk factors
affecting the Firm.

For purposes of this Form 10-Q, "Russia" refers to exposure to
clients and counterparties of the Firm for which the largest
proportion of their assets is located, or the largest proportion of
their revenue is derived, in Russia, based on the Firm’s internal
country risk management framework; "Russia-associated" refers to
exposure to clients and counterparties of the Firm with respect to
which economic or financial sanctions relating to the war in
Ukraine have been imposed or which have close association with
Russia.

Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
JPMorgan Chase and other market participants continue to make
progress with respect to the transition from the use of the London
Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and other IBORs to comply with
the International Organization of Securities Commission's
standards for transaction-based benchmark rates. The cessation
of the publication of the principal tenors of the U.S. dollar LIBOR
(i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month
LIBOR) is scheduled for June 30, 2023.

The Firm continues to engage with and support clients as they
move to replacement rates. In connection with the transition, as of
March 31, 2022 the Firm had remediated 96% of the notional
amount of its bilateral derivatives contracts linked to U.S. dollar
LIBOR by virtue of counterparty adherence to, or the contracts
otherwise being subject to, the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association, Inc.'s ("ISDA") IBOR Fallbacks Protocol,
and continues its client outreach with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR-
linked loans.

The Firm continues to monitor and evaluate client, industry,
market, regulatory and legislative developments. Refer to Business
Developments on pages 50-51 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form
10-K for additional information.

Business Developments
War in Ukraine
Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, the Firm’s business
activities related to Russia have generally been limited to assisting
clients with fulfilling or terminating pre-existing obligations and
managing their Russia-associated risks, as well as providing
payment services and acting as a custodian for global clients who
hold Russia and Russia-associated financial instruments.

The Firm increased its allowance for credit losses in the first
quarter due in part to client-specific Russia and Russia-associated
downgrades. However, the Firm's exposure to Russia and Russia-
associated clients and counterparties is not material to its financial
condition or results of operations.

The Firm continues to assess the ongoing secondary impacts of
the war in Ukraine, including: increased market volatility, effects on
global energy and commodities markets, client demand for credit
and liquidity, distress in certain industries or economic sectors,
heightened counterparty credit risk, potential recessionary and
inflationary pressures, impacts on global supply chains and
government actions, including the imposition of financial and
economic sanctions.

Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 54-62, Allowance for
Credit Losses on pages 63-65, Market Risk Management on
pages 67-71 and Country Risk Management on pages 72-73 for
additional information.

Complying with global sanctions
The Firm has engaged and continues to engage with government
authorities, regulators, and industry groups in connection with
analyzing and implementing procedures reasonably designed to
comply with financial and economic sanctions imposed on Russia
and Russia-associated entities and individuals by various
governments around the world.

Managing key operational risks
The Firm faces increased operational risk in its efforts to comply
with the various financial and economic sanctions that have been
imposed as a result of the war in Ukraine, as the requirements are
highly complex and continue to evolve.

The Firm is also focused on risks related to the increased potential
for cyber attacks that may be conducted in retaliation for the
sanctions imposed.

Refer to Operational Risk Management on page 74 for additional
information.

Supporting employees
The Firm has provided additional benefits and support to
employees who have been affected by the war.

(a) Included operating lease income of $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion for the three

months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, reflecting:

• lower equity underwriting fees primarily driven by lower issuance

activity, particularly in North America and EMEA,

• lower debt underwriting fees predominantly driven by high-yield
bonds as a result of reduced issuances in a volatile market,

partially offset by

• higher advisory fees benefiting from the closing of deals

announced in 2021.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 22-26 and Note 5 for
additional information.

Principal transactions revenue decreased largely in CIB,
reflecting:

• a loss of $524 million in Credit Adjustments & Other,

predominantly driven by funding spread widening, and credit
valuation adjustments related to increases in commodities
exposures and markdowns of derivative receivables from
Russia-associated counterparties,

• lower revenue in Equity Markets, particularly in derivatives and

Cash Equities, compared to a strong prior year, and

• lower revenue in Fixed Income Markets, particularly in

Securitized Products largely due to the rising rate environment,
which slowed down the pace of mortgage production,
predominantly offset by higher revenue in Currencies &
Emerging Markets on elevated client activity in a volatile market.

The decrease in Principal transactions revenue also reflects net
losses on certain legacy private equity investments in Corporate,
compared with net gains in the prior year.

9

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased as a result of:

• higher cash management fees in CIB and CB driven by growth

in transaction volume, and

• higher deposit-related fees in CCB.

Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 19-21, pages
22-26 and pages 27-28, respectively, and Note 5 for additional
information.

Asset management, administration and commissions revenue
increased predominantly driven by:

• strong cumulative net inflows into long-term products, as well as

higher performance fees, in AWM, and

• higher net inflows and average market levels in CCB.

Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 19-21, pages
29-31, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information.

Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected net investment
securities losses on sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and
government agency MBS, compared with net gains in the prior
year, associated with repositioning the investment securities
portfolios in both periods in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Corporate
segment results on pages 32-33 and Note 9 for additional
information.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to lower
production revenue from lower margins and volume, largely offset
by higher net mortgage servicing revenue on an increase in MSR
risk management results primarily driven by changes in
prepayment expectations. Refer to CCB segment results on pages
19-21, Note 5 and 14 for additional information.

Card income decreased due to higher amortization related to new
account origination costs in Card. Refer to CCB, CIB and CB
segment results on pages 19-21, pages 22-26 and pages 27-28,
respectively, and Note 5 for additional information.

Other income increased reflecting:

• net gains on equity investments in CIB,

• proceeds from an insurance settlement in Corporate, and

• the absence of weather-related write-downs recorded in the prior

year on certain renewable energy investments in CIB,

partially offset by

• lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of a

decline in volume, and

• lower net investment valuation gains in AWM.

 
Net interest income increased driven by balance sheet growth
and higher rates, partially offset by lower NII from PPP loans.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.4 trillion, up
$275 billion, predominantly driven by higher deposits with banks
and investment securities, and the yield was 1.86%, down 1 basis
point (“bp”). The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was
1.67%, a decrease of 2 bps. The net yield excluding Markets was
1.95%, up 2 bps.

Net yield excluding Markets is a non-GAAP financial measure.
Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and
rates schedule on page 165 for further details; and the Explanation
and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures on pages 15-16 for a further discussion of Net interest

The provision for credit losses increased driven by:

• a net addition of $902 million to the allowance for credit losses,
consisting of $776 million in wholesale and $127 million in
consumer. The addition largely reflects an increased weight
placed on the adverse scenarios, from the more balanced
weighting placed on the adverse and upside scenarios at
December 31, 2021, due to the potential effects associated with
higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, as well as
geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine. The increase in
the allowance also included client-specific Russia and Russia-
associated downgrades in CIB and AWM,

partially offset by

• lower net charge-offs of $475 million driven by Card, as

consumer cash balances remained elevated.

The prior year included a $5.2 billion net reduction in the allowance
for credit losses.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 19-21, CIB on pages 22-

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:

• higher structural expense, including professional fees,

• higher investments, including technology expense across the

LOBs and marketing expense in CCB,

• higher brokerage expense in CIB, as well as other outside

services expense, and

• higher legal expense predominantly in CIB,

partially offset by

• lower depreciation expense in CCB due to lower auto lease
assets and the impact of higher vehicle collateral values.

The prior year included a $550 million contribution to the Firm's
Foundation.

Total assets

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks increased
primarily as a result of growth in deposits. Deposits with banks
reflect the Firm’s placements of its excess cash with various
central banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements increased driven by Markets, reflecting:

• higher demand for securities to cover short positions,

• higher collateral requirements, and

• the impact of client-driven market-making activities.

Securities borrowed increased driven by Markets, resulting from
higher client-driven activities and an increase in demand for
securities to cover short positions. Refer to Note 10 for additional
information on securities purchased under resale agreements and
securities borrowed.

Trading assets increased driven by Markets, due to:

• higher securities related to client-driven market-making activities,

and

• higher derivative receivables, largely commodities,

predominantly oil and gas, as a result of market movements.

Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.

Investment securities increased resulting from net purchases of
securities, largely offset by paydowns, and unrealized losses on
AFS securities which are recognized in accumulated other
comprehensive income ("AOCI"). Refer to Corporate segment
results on pages 32-33, Investment Portfolio Risk Management on
page 66, and Notes 2 and 9 for additional information.

Loans were relatively flat, and reflected:

• lower residential real estate loans at fair value in Home Lending
as sales outpaced originations due to higher interest rates, and

• a decline in AWM due to paydowns and lower securities-based

lending,

offset by

• higher wholesale loans in CB and CIB.

The allowance for loan losses increased as a result of a net
addition of $806 million to the allowance for credit losses,
consisting of $677 million in wholesale and $129 million in
consumer. The addition largely reflects an increased weight
placed on the adverse scenarios, from the more balanced
weighting placed on the adverse and upside scenarios at
December 31, 2021, due to the potential effects associated with
higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, as well as geopolitical
risks, including the war in Ukraine. The increase in the allowance
also included client-specific Russia and Russia-associated
downgrades in CIB and AWM.

There was a $97 million addition to allowance for lending-related
commitments. This allowance is included in other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 46-66,
and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for a more detailed discussion of loans
and the allowance for loan losses.

 
 
 
Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased due to
higher client receivables related to client-driven activities in
Markets, including prime brokerage, during a period of heightened
market volatility.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased, reflecting
higher MSRs driven by purchases and originations, as well as the
impact of changes in market interest rates. Refer to Note 14 for
additional information.

Deposits increased in CIB, CCB and AWM, driven by:

• higher deposits in CIB's Payments and Securities Services

primarily driven by client activities, and

• growth in new and existing accounts in CCB across consumer

and small business customers,

partially offset by

• a decline in CB, principally due to seasonality.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 41-45 and Notes 2
and 15 for additional information.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements increased due to the impact of client
activities and higher secured financing of trading assets in
Markets. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 41-45 and
Note 10 for additional information.

Short-term borrowings increased as a result of higher net
issuance of commercial paper primarily for short-term liquidity
management in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 41-45 for additional information.

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market-making
activities in Fixed Income Markets, which resulted in higher levels
of short positions in debt instruments, as well as higher derivative
payables associated with market movements. Refer to Notes 2
and 4 for additional information.

13

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased reflecting
higher client payables related to client-driven activities primarily in
Markets, including prime brokerage, during a period of heightened
market volatility. Refer to Note 10 for additional information on
securities financing transactions.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs decreased
driven by maturities of credit card securitizations in Treasury and
CIO. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 41-45 and
Notes 13 and 22 for additional information on Firm-sponsored VIEs
and loan securitization trusts.

Long-term debt decreased driven by fair value hedge accounting
adjustments related to higher rates, partially offset by net
issuances in Treasury and CIO, as well as a decline in the fair
value of structured notes in CIB. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 41-45 for additional information.

Stockholders’ equity decreased as a result of a net unrealized
loss in AOCI, which was primarily driven by the impact of higher
rates on the AFS portfolio and cash flow hedges in Treasury and
CIO. Refer to page 83 for information on changes in stockholders’
equity, Capital actions on page 39, and Note 19 for additional
information.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred to as
“reported” basis; these financial statements appear on pages 80-
84.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, the
Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP financial measures
at the Firmwide and segment level. These non-GAAP measures
include:

• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the overhead ratio,

which include certain reclassifications to present total net
revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-
exempt securities on a basis comparable to taxable investments
and securities (“FTE” basis);

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue less total

noninterest expense;

• Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue

excluding Markets;

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS;

• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense

excluding Firmwide legal expense; and

• Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained,

excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use Of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on
pages 58-60 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of management’s use of non-GAAP financial measures.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking,
Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset &
Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the products
and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they
reflect the manner in which financial information is currently
evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are
presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and
Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
on pages 15-16 for a definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present each
segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management
reporting process that derives business segment results includes
the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm
periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and
reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further
refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also
assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an
annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business
metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and
analysts in assessing performance.

Revenue sharing
When business segments join efforts to sell products and services
to the Firm’s clients, the participating business segments may
agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is
generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related
product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s)
involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these
revenue-sharing agreements.

Funds transfer pricing
Funds transfer pricing ("FTP") is the process by which the Firm
allocates interest income and expense to each business segment
and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to
Treasury and CIO within Corporate.

The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate risk
and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-
balance sheet products. Periodically the methodology and
assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect
economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the
allocation of net interest income to the business segments.

Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred to as
equity. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to
allocate capital are reassessed and as a result, the capital
allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business
equity on page 38, and page 93 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for additional information on capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business
segment reporting methodology on pages 61-62 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of those
methodologies.

• higher amortization related to new account origination costs in

Card, and

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline in

volume,

partially offset by

• higher net mortgage servicing revenue on an increase in MSR

risk management results primarily driven by changes in
prepayment expectations,

• higher asset management fees as a result of higher net inflows

and average market levels, and

• higher deposit-related fees.

Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes in the
value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees
and related income. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on
card income.

Noninterest expense was $7.7 billion, up 7%, reflecting:

• investments in the business and increased structural expenses,

predominantly driven by compensation, technology and
marketing,

(b) In the first quarter of 2022, the Firm changed its methodology for allocating

income taxes to the LOBs, with no impact to Firmwide net income. Prior-period
amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(c) Included MSR risk management results of $109 million and $(115) million for

the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

• lower volume- and revenue- related expenses primarily

depreciation expense due to lower auto lease assets and the
impact of higher vehicle collateral values.

The provision for credit losses was $678 million, reflecting:

• net charge-offs of $553 million, down $470 million, driven by
Card, as consumer cash balances remained elevated, and
• a $125 million addition to the allowance for credit losses in

Home Lending.

The prior year included a $4.6 billion reduction in the allowance for
credit losses.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 46-66
and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63-65 for a further
discussion of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit
losses.

(a) At March 31, 2022 and 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more
days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $315 million and $458
million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government
guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from
being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(b) At March 31, 2022 and 2021, generally excludes loans that were under payment deferral
programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Consumer Credit
Portfolio on pages 49-53 for further information on consumer payment assistance
activity. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 related payment deferral
programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which were considered
collateral-dependent at time of exit.

(c) At March 31, 2022 nonaccrual loans excluded $179 million of PPP loans 90 or more

days past due and guaranteed by the SBA.

(d) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(e) At March 31, 2022 and 2021, included $2.9 billion and $23.4 billion of loans,

respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP. The Firm does not expect to realize
material credit losses on PPP loans because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA.
Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 48 for a further discussion of the PPP.

(f) At March 31, 2022 and 2021, the principal balance of loans in Home Lending, Card and
Auto under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic
were as follows: (1) $728 million and $8.1 billion in Home Lending, respectively; (2) $15
million and $105 million in Card, respectively; and (3) $45 million and $127 million in
Auto, respectively. Loans that are performing according to their modified terms are
generally not considered delinquent. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 49-53
for further information on consumer payment assistance activity.

(g) At March 31, 2022 and 2021, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government

agencies of $370 million and $557 million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past

(a) Consists primarily of centrally managed credit valuation adjustments (“CVA”),

funding valuation adjustments (“FVA”) on derivatives, other valuation
adjustments, and certain components of fair value option elected liabilities,
which are primarily reported in principal transactions revenue. Results are
presented net of associated hedging activities and net of CVA and FVA
amounts allocated to Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.

Quarterly results
Net income was $4.4 billion, down 26%.
Net revenue was $13.5 billion, down 7%.
Banking revenue was $4.2 billion, down 6%.
• Investment Banking revenue was $2.1 billion, down 28%, driven
by lower Investment Banking fees, down 31%, reflecting lower
equity and debt underwriting fees. The Firm ranked #1 for Global
Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.
– Equity underwriting fees were $249 million, down 76%,

primarily driven by lower issuance activity, particularly in North
America and EMEA.

– Debt underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, down 20%,

predominantly driven by high-yield bonds as a result of
reduced issuances in a volatile market.

– Advisory fees were $801 million, up 18%, benefiting from the

closing of deals announced in 2021.

• Payments revenue was $1.9 billion, up 33%, and included net

gains on equity investments. Excluding these net gains, revenue
was $1.5 billion, up 9%, predominantly driven by higher fees,
deposits and improved deposit margins.

• Lending revenue was $321 million, up 21%, predominantly

driven by fair value gains on hedges of accrual loans, compared
to losses in the prior year.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $9.3 billion, down 8%.
Markets revenue was $8.8 billion, down 3%.
• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $5.7 billion, down 1%,

particularly in Securitized Products, largely due to the rising rate
environment, which slowed down the pace of mortgage
production, predominantly offset by higher revenue in Currencies
& Emerging Markets on elevated client activity in a volatile
market.

22

 
• Equity Markets revenue was $3.1 billion, down 7%, driven by

lower revenue in derivatives and Cash Equities, compared to a
strong prior year.

• Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 2%, driven by

improved deposit margins and growth in fees.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $524 million, driven by
funding spread widening as well as credit valuation adjustments
relating to both increases in commodities exposures and
markdowns of derivative receivables from Russia-associated
counterparties.

Noninterest expense was $7.3 billion, up 3%, driven by higher
structural expense, investments in the business and legal
expense, largely offset by lower volume- and revenue-related
expense including revenue-related compensation.

The provision for credit losses of $445 million was driven by a net
addition to the allowance for credit losses, compared with a net
benefit of $331 million in the prior year.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 46-66
and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63-65 for further

losses.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes selected income statement data
for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both Fixed Income
Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal
transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net
interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business
performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across
revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net
interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are

reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Refer to
Notes 5 and 6 for a description of the composition of these income
statement line items. Refer to Markets revenue on page 70 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information.

For the periods presented below, the predominant source of
principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon
executing new transactions.

clients through the CIB.

(b) Refer to Business Segment Results on page 17 for discussion of revenue

sharing.

Quarterly results
Net income was $850 million, down 28%, largely driven by a net
increase in the provision for credit losses compared with a net
benefit in the prior year.

Net revenue was $2.4 billion, flat compared to the prior year. Net
interest income was $1.5 billion, up 4%, driven by the impact of
higher deposits. Noninterest revenue was $867 million, down 5%,
driven by lower investment banking revenue, predominantly offset
by higher payments revenue.

Noninterest expense was $1.1 billion, up 17%, largely driven by
investments in the business and higher volume- and revenue-
related expense, including compensation.

The provision for credit losses was $157 million, driven by a net
addition to the allowance for credit losses, compared with a net
benefit of $118 million in the prior year.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 46-66
and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63-65 for further

losses.

• net losses on certain legacy private equity investments,

compared with net gains in the prior year, and

• net investment securities losses on sales of U.S. Treasuries and
U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, compared with net
gains in the prior year, associated with repositioning the
investment securities portfolios in both periods,

partially offset by

• proceeds from an insurance settlement.

Net interest income increased primarily driven by higher rates,
which resulted in slower prepayments.

Noninterest expense of $184 million was down $691 million
primarily driven by the absence of the contribution to the Firm's
Foundation recorded in the prior year.

The current period tax benefit was predominantly driven by the
change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to
U.S. federal and state and local taxes.

Other Corporate also reflects the Firm's International Consumer
activity, which includes Chase U.K., the Firm's digital retail bank in
the U.K.; Nutmeg, a digital wealth manager in the U.K.; and a 40%

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities.
When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises
customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes
markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm
takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to
manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that
balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and
investors and protects the safety and soundness of the Firm.

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among
other things:

• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and

escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;

• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and

management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and

• Firmwide structures for risk governance.

The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation
framework with strong internal governance and independent
oversight by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of
risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s
performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes.

Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight framework
involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts
of risks.

Risk governance and oversight functions
The following sections of this Form 10-Q and the 2021 Form 10-K
discuss the risk governance and oversight functions in place to
manage the risks inherent in the Firm’s business activities.

PPP. As of March 31, 2022, the Firm had $3.6 billion of loans
remaining under the PPP program, which receive a zero percent
risk weight under the federal banking agencies’ regulatory capital
rule. The Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on
PPP loans because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA.

Total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR
includes PPP loans as the Firm did not participate in the Federal
Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility, which
would have allowed the Firm to exclude them under the final rule.

Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk. On January
1, 2022, the Firm adopted “Standardized Approach for
Counterparty Credit Risk” (“SA-CCR”), which replaced the Current
Exposure Method used to measure derivatives counterparty
exposure under Standardized approach RWA and Advanced
approach RWA where internal models are not used, as well as
leverage exposure used to calculate the SLR in the regulatory
capital framework. The rule issued by the U.S. banking regulators
in November 2019 applies to Basel III Advanced Approaches
banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A.

Based on the derivatives exposure as of December 31, 2021, the
adoption of SA-CCR increased the Firm’s Standardized RWA by
approximately $40 billion, a decrease of approximately 30 bps to
the Firm's CET1 capital ratio at March 31, 2022, and resulted in a
modest decrease in its total leverage exposure. In addition, the
adoption of SA-CCR increased the Firm's Advanced RWA at
March 31, 2022, but to a lesser extent than Standardized.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and
associated risks during normal economic environments and under
stressed conditions.

Refer to pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K, Note
21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital
Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for
a further discussion of the Firm’s Capital Risk Management.

Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios
and overall capital adequacy standards for large and
internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies ("BHCs") and
banks, including the Firm and its insured depository institution
(“IDI”) subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The
minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs
and banks is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets
(“RWA”), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet
exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach
(“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based capital ratios,
the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of
the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their
respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s Basel
III Standardized-risk-based ratios are currently more binding than
the Basel III Advanced-risk-based ratios.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approaches
banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR.
The Firm’s SLR is currently more binding than the Basel III
Standardized-risk-based ratios. Refer to SLR on page 38 for
additional information.

Key Regulatory Developments
CECL regulatory capital transition. On December 31, 2021, the
CECL capital transition provisions, which delayed the effects of
CECL on regulatory capital for two years, expired. Beginning
January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital benefit recognized
as of December 31, 2021, will be phased out at 25% per year over
a three-year period. As of March 31, 2022, CET1 capital reflected
the remaining 75%, or $2.2 billion, benefit associated with the
CECL capital transition provisions.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased out 25% of
the other relevant CECL capital transition provisions recognized as
of December 31, 2021, from Tier 2 capital, adjusted average
assets, and total leverage exposure.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and Note 1 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on
CECL capital transition provisions and the CECL accounting
guidance.

N.A. is excluded from the Firm’s reported LCR under the LCR rule.

The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR
fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its eligible
HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing
business activity.

Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA
discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable
securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm
believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess
eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are
not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these
securities was approximately $939 billion and $914 billion as of
March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, although
the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time
would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair
value increased compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to
an increase in CIB trading assets.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal
Home Loan Banks ("FHLBs") and the discount window at the
Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm
to such banks of approximately $298 billion and $308 billion as of
March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. This
borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities
reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered
securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank
discount window and other central banks. Although available, the
Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve
Bank discount window and the other central banks as a primary
source of liquidity.

NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) rule requires that the Firm
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of
“available” stable funding that is sufficient to meet their “required”
amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.

As of March 31, 2022, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based
on the Firm's current understanding of the final rule. The Firm will
be required to publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi
annually beginning in 2023.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its
contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or
that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and
tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities.
Refer to pages 97-104 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K and
the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the
Firm’s website for a further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk
Management.

LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet
their respective estimated total net cash outflows over a
prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. Under the
LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR
requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates,
must be excluded from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. The
LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required
to be a minimum of 100%. Refer to page 98 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2021 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for
additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows.

The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended March 31,
2022, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021 based on the
Firm’s interpretation of the LCR framework.

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured
funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet
obligations, which includes both short- and long-term cash
requirements.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of
funding including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding
in the capital markets and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the
primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding
through short- or long-term secured borrowings, through the
issuance of unsecured

long-term debt, or from borrowings from the Intermediate Holding
Company (“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily
funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term
secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury
and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in
cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest
rate and liquidity risk characteristics.

Refer to Note 22 for additional information on off-balance sheet
obligations.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm’s
reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of
the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale
operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources
of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered to be
stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from
customers that maintain operating service relationships with the
Firm.

The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-
to-deposits ratio, and deposits as a percentage of total liabilities,
as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally
more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit
balances. However, during periods of market disruption those
trends could be affected.

Average deposits increased for the three months ended March 31,
2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021,
reflecting inflows across the LOBs primarily driven by the ongoing
effect of certain government actions. In CCB, the increase was
also driven by growth from new and existing accounts across both
consumer and small business customers.

Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Business Segment Results
and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 17-33
and pages 12-13, respectively, for further information on deposit
and liability balance trends.

of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on preferred stock and common stockholders’ equity.

Short-term funding
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist
of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase.
These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality
securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase increased at March 31, 2022, compared
with December 31, 2021, due to the impact of client activities and
higher secured financing of trading assets in Markets.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under
agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to investment
and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s demand for financing,
the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities,
including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the
investment securities and market-making portfolios), and other
market and portfolio factors.

43

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily
consist of issuances of wholesale commercial paper and other
borrowed funds. The increase in commercial paper at March 31,
2022, from December 31, 2021, and for the average three months
ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period, was due
to higher net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity
management.

The increase in unsecured other borrowed funds at March 31,
2022, from December 31, 2021, and for the average three months
ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period, was
primarily due to higher overdrafts in CIB.

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding
and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is
driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations,
and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding
objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market
access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various
funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-
term funding plan.

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding
is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of
both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent
Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its
subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external
counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term
unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 97-104 and Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-
term debt.

Long-term unsecured funding

The Firm can also raise secured long-term funding through
securitization of consumer credit card loans and FHLB advances.
The following table summarizes the securitization issuance and
FHLB advances and their respective maturities or redemptions for
the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit
ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect
on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of
funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and
decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to
lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings
downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral
factors, which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains
sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding
capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other
third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in
credit ratings. Refer to liquidity risk and credit-related contingent
features in Note 4 for additional information on the impact of a
credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs,
and on derivatives and collateral agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of March 31, 2022, were as follows:

the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 16 for further information.

(c) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(d) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, included $2.9 billion and $5.4 billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP. The Firm does not expect to realize material

credit losses on PPP loans because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 48 for a further discussion of the PPP.

(e) Includes scored mortgage loans held in CCB and CIB.
(f) Credit card, home equity and certain business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available lines of credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and
does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain conditions are met, home equity commitments and
certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer
to Note 22 for further information.

(g) Includes billed interest and fees.
(h) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.
(i) Represents the notional amount of protection obtained through the issuance of credit-related notes that reference certain pools of residential real estate and auto loans in the retained

consumer portfolio.

(j) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $598 million and $623
million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card
loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(k) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
(l) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded $179 million and $506 million, respectively, of PPP loans 90 or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA.
(m) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $23.9 billion and $21.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts

were excluded when calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates.

49

 
 
 
 
Consumer assistance
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to customers
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly in the form
of payment deferrals. In the first quarter of 2022, the COVID-19
consumer payment deferral programs ended for new enrollments,
except for loans collateralized by residential real estate, as that
program remains in effect due to the U.S. government's extension
of its declaration of a national emergency with respect to the
COVID-19 pandemic.

As of March 31, 2022, the Firm had approximately $825 million of
retained consumer loans under payment deferral programs,
predominantly in residential real estate. Predominantly all
borrowers that exited payment deferral programs are current.
During the first quarter of 2022, there were approximately $385
million of new enrollments in consumer payment deferral
programs. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K
for additional information.

50

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loans decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by residential
real estate loans at fair value and auto and other loans, partially
offset by higher retained residential real estate loans.

Residential real estate: The residential real estate portfolio,
including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly
consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.

Retained loans increased compared to December 31, 2021 in
AWM, on slower prepayments. Retained nonaccrual loans
decreased from December 31, 2021 reflecting improved credit
performance. Net recoveries for the three months ended March 31,
2022 were higher when compared with the same period in the prior
year as the current year benefited from the recovery on a loan sale
as well as further improvement in Home Price Index ("HPI").

Loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021, as sales
outpaced originations in Home Lending due to higher interest rates
and lower loan purchase activity in CIB. Nonaccrual loans at fair
value increased from December 31, 2021 driven by CIB.

The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was
$17.6 billion at March 31, 2022. This amount included $5.9 billion
of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing
payments or have been modified and $5.7 billion of interest-only
balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law
when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their
credit risk profile.

At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying value of
interest-only residential mortgage loans were $32.1 billion and
$30.0 billion, respectively. These loans have an interest-only
payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-
rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically
originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers,
predominantly in AWM. The interest-only residential mortgage loan
portfolio reflected net recoveries for the three months ended
March 31, 2022, in line with the performance of the broader prime
mortgage portfolio.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s residential
mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government
agencies, predominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair
value. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential
unrecoverable claim payments related to government-insured
loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for
loan losses.

for additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, including loans
at fair value, predominantly consists of prime-quality scored auto
and business banking loans, as well as overdrafts. The portfolio
decreased when compared with December 31, 2021 due to a
decrease in business banking loans driven by PPP loan
forgiveness. Scored auto portfolio loans were relatively flat as
paydowns were offset by loan originations. Net charge-offs for the
three months ended March 31, 2022 increased when compared to
the same period in the prior year due to higher overdraft and
scored auto charge-offs partially offset by lower scored business
banking charge-offs. The scored auto portfolio net charge-off rates
were 0.18% and 0.13% for the three months ended March 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively.

generally not considered delinquent.

 
 
 
Credit card
Total credit card loans decreased from December 31, 2021
reflecting the impact of seasonality. The March 31, 2022 30+ and
90+ day delinquency rates of 1.09% and 0.54%, respectively,
increased compared to the December 31, 2021 30+ and 90+ day
delinquency rates of 1.04% and 0.50%, also reflecting the impact
of seasonality. Net charge-offs decreased for the three months
ended March 31, 2022 compared with the same period in the prior
year. Delinquency and net charge-off rates continue to benefit from
elevated consumer cash balances.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically
remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm’s
allowance for loan losses includes the estimated uncollectible
portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to
Note 11 for further information about this portfolio, including
information about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and FICO
composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.

Modifications of credit card loans
At March 31, 2022, the Firm had $901 million of credit card loans
outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, which does not
include loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications
that are not considered TDRs, compared to $1.0 billion at
December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 11 for additional information

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk
primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and
hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well
as through various operating services (such as cash management
and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash
placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by
the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the
balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the
loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan
business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk.
The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting
ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction
structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion
on pages 56-59 for further information.

The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in
CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated exposures
held in CCB, including business banking and auto dealer exposure
for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining
the allowance for credit losses.

In the three months ended March 31, 2022, credit continued to
perform well with charge-offs at historically low levels, however,
nonperforming exposure increased driven by client-specific Russia
and Russia-associated downgrades. Refer to Business
Developments on page 8 and Country Risk on pages 72-73 for
additional information.

As of March 31, 2022, retained loans increased $9.6 billion driven
by CIB and CB partially offset by decreases in AWM. Lending-
related commitments increased $10.8 billion, driven by net portfolio
activity in CIB.

As of March 31, 2022, the net increase in nonperforming loans of
$303 million was driven by client-specific Russia and Russia-
associated downgrades. Nonperforming derivatives increased
$281 million largely driven by client-specific downgrades in
commodities.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile
The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of March 31, 2022, and
December 31, 2021. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as
investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when determining the internal risk rating for each credit
facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for further information on internal risk ratings.

(a) Loans held-for-sale are primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained portfolio.
(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.
(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which

protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management
activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the
issuance of credit-related notes.

(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that

are in a receivable position at March 31, 2022, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with actual or
potential credit concerns.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention,
substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $36.9 billion and
$38.2 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, representing approximately 3.2% and 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure,
respectively. The decrease in criticized exposure was driven by client-specific upgrades and net portfolio activity, largely offset by client-
specific downgrades. The $36.9 billion of criticized exposure at March 31, 2022 was largely undrawn and $33.2 billion was performing.

The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The industry of risk category is
generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for additional
information on industry concentrations.

Presented below is additional detail on certain of the Firm’s industry exposures.

Real Estate
Real Estate exposure was $160.4 billion as of March 31, 2022, of which $91.1 billion was multifamily lending as shown in the table below.
Criticized exposure decreased by $317 million from $5.3 billion at December 31, 2021 to $4.9 billion at March 31, 2022, driven by client-
specific upgrades and net portfolio activity largely offset by client-specific downgrades.

Consumer & Retail
Consumer & Retail exposure was $121.1 billion as of March 31, 2022, and predominantly included Retail, Food and Beverage, and Business
and Consumer Services as shown in the table below. Criticized exposure decreased by $2.6 billion from $9.9 billion at December 31, 2021 to
$7.3 billion at March 31, 2022, driven by net portfolio activity and client-specific upgrades partially offset by client-specific downgrades.

Loans
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a variety of
clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to
high-net-worth individuals. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion
on loans, including information about delinquencies, loan
modifications and other credit quality indicators.

The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan
portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.
Since March 31, 2021, nonaccrual loan exposure decreased $968
million, largely in Oil & Gas and Consumer & Retail, with net
portfolio activity and client-specific upgrades being largely offset by
client-specific downgrades including Russia and Russia-
associated clients.

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees,
to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual
amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum
possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these
commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these
guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according
to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled,
or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a
result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount
of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative
of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding
requirements. Refer to Note 22 for further information on
wholesale lending-related commitments.

Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin
loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are
collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage
accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and readily marketable
debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no
allowance for credit losses is generally held against these
receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin
requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an
ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or
other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These
receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts
receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk
including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest
rates, foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The
Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs
and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net
open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The
Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk
and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty
and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit
risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm is
exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For
exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options,
and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm
can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant central
counterparty clearing house ("CCP"). Where possible, the Firm
seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative
contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting
arrangements and collateral agreements.

61

The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative
transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign
exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral
agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades
that are settled daily — was approximately 88% at both March 31,
2022 and December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 4 for additional
information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements. Refer to
Note 4 for a further discussion of derivative contracts,
counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the
Consolidated balance sheets were $73.6 billion and $57.1 billion at
March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The
increase was largely commodities, predominantly oil and gas, as a
result of market movements. Derivative receivables represent the
fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally
enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash
collateral held by the Firm.

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral
that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s
exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition
of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality
liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit
risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which
generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality
liquid assets under the LCR rule.

The benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each
counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting
agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative
receivables for each counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7
government securities, other liquid government agency and
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities)
delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as
collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency
and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet
settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not
reduce the balances and is not included in the tables below, it is
available as security against potential exposure that could arise
should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the
Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the
Firm’s use of collateral agreements.

Credit portfolio management activities
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in
its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user, to
manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with traditional
lending activities (loans and lending-related commitments) and
derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale
businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against
certain loans in the retained wholesale portfolio through the
issuance of credit-related notes. Information on credit portfolio
management activities is provided in the table below.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management's
estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life
of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and
certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses comprises:

• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained

loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented
separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,

• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is

presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts
payable and other liabilities, and

• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is
reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance
sheets.

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2022 was $19.6
billion, an increase from $18.7 billion at December 31, 2021,
consisting of: $776 million in wholesale, across the LOBs, and
$127 million in consumer, driven by the residential real estate
portfolio.

The change in the allowance largely reflects an increased weight
placed on the adverse scenarios, from the more balanced
weighting placed on the adverse and upside scenarios at
December 31, 2021, due to the potential effects associated with
higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, as well as geopolitical
risks, including the war in Ukraine. The increase in the allowance
also included client-specific Russia and Russia-associated
downgrades in CIB and AWM.

The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a
weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic
scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive
macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions
provided in the table below, resulting in weighted average U.S.
unemployment rates above 4% through the second quarter of
2023 and year over year growth in U.S. real GDP of 2.5% in the
second quarter of 2023.

The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment
rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:

dependent loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status for
the wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific allowance for credit card loans modified, or reasonably expected to be modified, in a TDR is calculated based on the
loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.

(b) The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of
principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising
from the investment securities portfolio or from principal
investments. The investment securities portfolio is predominantly
held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s balance
sheet and asset-liability management objectives. Principal
investments are predominantly privately-held financial instruments
and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are
typically intended to be held over extended periods and,
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized
gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a
default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is
mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by
Treasury and CIO predominantly consists of high-quality
securities. At March 31, 2022, the Treasury and CIO investment
securities portfolio, net of allowance for credit losses, was $677.5
billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising
the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where
available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal
risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 32-33
and Note 9 for further information on the investment securities
portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Market Risk
Management on pages 67-71 for further information on the market
risk inherent in the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management
on pages 41-45 for further information on related liquidity risk.

Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically privately-held financial
instruments representing ownership interests or other forms of
junior capital. In general, principal investments include tax-oriented
investments and investments made to enhance or accelerate the
Firm’s business strategies and exclude those that are consolidated
on the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made by
dedicated investing businesses or as part of a broader business
strategy. The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the
LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective
financial results. The Firm’s investments will continue to evolve in
line with its strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to support
underserved communities and minority-owned businesses.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in
market factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity
and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the
value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 133-140 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk
Management organization, market risk measurement, risk
monitoring and control, and predominant business activities that
give rise to market risk.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and
are limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict
losses. This imprecision may be heightened when sudden or
severe shifts in market conditions occur. For additional discussion
on model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 149 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s existing
market risk measures to identify opportunities for enhancement,
and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate those measures
accordingly over time.

Value-at-risk
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical risk
measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market
moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single
VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management
VaR and Regulatory VaR.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-
day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which
approximates a 95% confidence level. For risk management
purposes, the Firm believes this methodology provides a daily
measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management
decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other
market risk measures, provides the appropriate information
needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates separately a
daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules
(“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory
VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and
enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s
portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the
Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors.
Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results.
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 149 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for information regarding
model reviews and approvals.

Refer to page 135 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
further information regarding VaR, including the inherent
limitations, and the key differences between Risk Management
VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III
Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available
on the Firm’s website, for additional information on Regulatory VaR
and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the
Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and
the respective backtesting). Refer to Other risk measures on pages
138-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further
information regarding nonstatistical market risk measures used by
the Firm.

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect

correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.

(b) In line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of

the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-
based measures.

(c) During the period ended March 31, 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market resulted in elevated Average and Maximum Credit

portfolio VaR.

(d) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification benefit is not meaningful.
(e) Average and Maximum Corporate and other LOB VaR were driven by a private equity position that became publicly traded at the end of the third quarter of 2020. As of March 31,

2021 the Firm no longer held this position.

Quarter over quarter results
Average total VaR increased by $26 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2022 when compared with December 31, 2021.
This increase was driven by Credit portfolio VaR, predominantly due
to the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in
the nickel market, as well as increased volatility in fixed income and
commodities impacting CIB trading VaR.

Year over year results
Average total VaR was $63 million for the three months ended March
31, 2022, reflecting the effects of nickel price increases and the
associated volatility in the nickel market impacting Credit portfolio
VaR, as well as increased volatility in fixed income and commodities
impacting CIB trading VaR. Average total VaR decreased by $43
million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared with
the same period in the prior year. This decrease was driven by
volatility which occurred at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
rolling out of the one-year historical look-back period in the first half
of 2021, predominantly impacting exposures in fixed income and
commodities.

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters. The movement in VaR in March 2022 was driven by
changes in nickel-related counterparty exposure in the Firm's Credit portfolio.

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses that
are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they
exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven
trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded
components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and
losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. Under the Firm’s
Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the
simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions on average five times every 100 trading days. The number of VaR
backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market
volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.

For the 12 months ended March 31, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 141 of the 261 days, and observed 23 VaR backtesting
exceptions. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 43 of the 64 days, and observed three VaR
backtesting exceptions.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and three months ended
March 31, 2022. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of
days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the
intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the
Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the
Firm’s covered positions.

Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net
income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the
Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only
from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking
activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities,
taking deposits, issuing debt and the investment securities
portfolio. Refer to the table on page 134 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2021 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying
positions included in earnings-at-risk.

One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is
through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s
interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is
presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest
income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses
market interest rates and in the case of deposits, pricing
assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this
baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities
denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar”
currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans,
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-term
debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer
pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other
sensitivity-based measures as described on page 134 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K.
Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net
interest income baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing
multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift
involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an
equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term
rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield
curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term
rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing
long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors,
including:
• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes

in interest rates from baseline rates.

• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and
reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions
that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in
response to any such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage
prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in
the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the
time since origination, and other factors which are updated
periodically based on historical experience. Deposit forecasts
used in the baseline and scenarios include certain assumptions
relating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing.

• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas,

represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change
upon a given change in market interest rates. The deposit rates
paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid, due
to repricing lags and other factors.

70

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated
and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the
Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements
in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. While a relevant
measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk
analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest
income (Refer to Outlook on page 7 for additional information).

The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table

The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of March 31,
2022 compared to December 31, 2021 reflected updates to the
Firm’s baseline for higher rates as well as the impact of changes in
the Firm’s balance sheet.

As of March 31, 2022, the Firm’s sensitivity to the parallel and
long-term shift in rates is primarily the result of a greater impact
from assets repricing compared to the impact of liabilities repricing,
while the shift in short-term rates is primarily the result of a greater
impact from liabilities repricing compared to the impact of assets
repricing.

2021.

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by assessing the potential impact on
net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the
predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on
the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-sensitive instruments that are not
included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being
hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at
March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply
management’s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement framework:

• Lending exposures are measured at the total committed

amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for credit
losses and eligible cash and marketable securities collateral
received

• Deposits are measured as the cash balances placed with

central and commercial banks

• Securities financing exposures are measured at their receivable

balance, net of eligible collateral received

• Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value of all

positions, including both long and short positions

• Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is measured
at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair value of the eligible
collateral received

• Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net notional

amount of protection purchased or sold for the same underlying
reference entity, inclusive of the fair value of the derivative
receivable or payable; reflecting the manner in which the Firm
manages these exposures

The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the reporting
provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory requirements.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to
country risk resulting from financial, economic, political or other
significant developments which adversely affect the value of the
Firm’s exposures related to a particular country or set of countries.
The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various
portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and
measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified
given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Refer to pages 141-142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management.

Sources and measurement
The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and
deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether cross-
border or locally funded. Country exposure includes activity with
both government and private-sector entities in a country.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk management approach,
attribution of exposure to an individual country is based on the
country where the largest proportion of the assets of the
counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are located or where the
largest proportion of its revenue is derived, which may be different
than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or country of incorporation.

Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the Firm’s
risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of the
counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors attributed to that
country. Activities which result in contingent or indirect exposure to
a country are not included in the country exposure measure (for
example, providing clearing services or secondary exposure to
collateral on securities financing receivables).

Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the
measurement and allocation of country exposure, particularly in
the case of certain non-linear or index products, or where the
nature of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is not
suitable for attribution to an individual country. The use of different
measurement approaches or assumptions could affect the amount
of reported country exposure.

Risk Reporting
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by
country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2022 and their
comparative exposures as of December 31, 2021. The selection of
countries represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by
individual country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk
management approach, and does not represent the Firm’s view of
any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country
exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity
and market flows.

The increase in exposure to Germany and the decrease in
exposure to the U.K. were primarily due to changes in cash
placements with the central banks of those countries driven by
balance sheet and liquidity management activities.

As of March 31, 2022, exposure to Russia, based on the Firm's
internal country risk measurement framework, was approximately
$650 million. This largely reflects cross-border lending activity, net
of the allowance for credit losses, to Russian corporate clients.

Cybersecurity Risk
The Firm faces increased risk of cyber attacks due to potential
retaliation for the sanctions imposed as a result of the war in
Ukraine. The Firm has implemented additional precautionary
measures and controls reasonably designed to address this
increased risk, such as enhanced threat monitoring. There can be
no assurance that the measures taken by the Firm to protect
against cybersecurity breaches will provide absolute security
against cyber attacks.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors,
or external events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems.
Operational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and
estimations and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the
Firm’s activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including
fraudulent acts, business disruptions (including those caused by
extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control), cyberattacks,
inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable
laws, rules and regulations or failure of vendors or other third party
providers to perform in accordance with their agreements.
Operational Risk Management attempts to manage operational
risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, the
characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory
environments in which it operates. Refer to Operational Risk
Management on pages 143-149 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Operational Risk Management.
Details on other select examples of operational risks are provided
below.

In response to the war in Ukraine, numerous sanctions have been
imposed on Russia and Russia-associated entities and individuals
by various governments around the world, including the authorities
in the U.S., the U.K. and the EU. These sanctions are complex and
evolving at a rapid pace in response to the war. The Firm faces
increased operational risk associated with interpreting and
maintaining these complex compliance programs. To manage this
increased risk, the Firm has implemented additional controls
reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of non-compliance and to
prevent dealing with sanctioned persons or in property subject to
sanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments as required by
the applicable regulations.

Business and technology resiliency risk
Disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s control such
as the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, severe
weather, power or telecommunications loss, failure of a third party
to provide expected services, cyberattacks and terrorism. The
Firmwide Business Resiliency Program is designed to enable the
Firm to prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business
disruptions including occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond
its control that may impact critical business functions and
supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology, facilities and third
parties). The program includes governance, awareness training,
planning and testing of recovery strategies, as well as strategic
and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business
interruption and public safety risks.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are
integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most
complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to
ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.
The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended
to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made
as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently
reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The
methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors,
the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and
risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s
businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures
are intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes
its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and
liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the
Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management’s
estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life
of the Firm’s financial assets measured at amortized cost and
certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained

loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a
number of matters including development and weighting of
macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss
experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk
ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining
expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's
2021 Form 10-K for further information on these judgments as well
as the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to determine the
Firm’s allowance for credit losses; and refer to Allowance for credit
losses on pages 63-65 and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further
information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the
Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic
forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter
forecast period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-quarter
forecast incorporates hundreds of MEVs that are relevant for
exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being
driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables. The
specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled
losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S.

unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP,
U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate credit
spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of economic
conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit
losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to
significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the
next.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or
input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because
management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in
estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors
and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not
be consistent across all geographies or product types, and
changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent,
such that improvement in one factor or input may offset
deterioration in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic
forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined
using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios,
which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the
allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The
central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those
variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario shown on
page 63 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative adverse scenario
assumes a significantly elevated U.S. unemployment rate,
averaging approximately 2.5% higher
over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of
approximately 4.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022; lower
U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly
3.1% lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a
peak difference of approximately 7.0% in the fourth
quarter of 2022; and lower national HPI with a peak
difference of 20.0% in the fourth quarter of 2023.

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes
in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons,
including:

• The Firm increased the weight placed on the adverse scenarios
in estimating the allowance for credit losses as of March 31,
2022, and accordingly, the existing allowance reflects credit
losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario.

• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and

nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply
extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic
variables.

75

• Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition and

borrower behavior can significantly affect the allowance for credit
losses.

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to
macroeconomic forecasts as of March 31, 2022, the Firm
compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse
scenario to its central scenario. Without considering offsetting or
correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Firm’s
allowance for credit losses, the comparison between these two
scenarios for the lending exposures below reflect the following
differences:

• An increase of approximately $600 million for residential real

estate loans and lending-related commitments

• An increase of approximately $2.4 billion for credit card loans

• An increase of approximately $2.8 billion for wholesale loans

and lending-related commitments

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and
is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for
credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other
adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be
influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled
lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of
these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current
circumstances and conditions.

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent economic
conditions, the Firm believes that its process to consider the
available information and associated risks and uncertainties is
appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit
losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended
March 31, 2022.

Fair value
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair
value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at
fair value on a recurring basis, including, derivatives, structured
note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain
assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans,
where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the
underlying collateral.

Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair
value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level
3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information.

receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as
such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of
inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would be reduced if
netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash
collateral.

Goodwill impairment
Management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for
impairment. Refer to Goodwill impairment on page 152 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a description of the
significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill
impairment.

Refer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill, including
the goodwill impairment assessment as of March 31, 2022.

Credit card rewards liability
The credit card rewards liability was $10.1 billion and $9.8 billion at
March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and is
recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to page 152 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a description of the significant
assumptions and sensitivities, associated with the Firm’s credit
card rewards liability.

Income taxes
Refer to Income taxes on pages 152-153 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2021 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions,
judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for
income taxes.

Litigation reserves
Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 30 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a description of the significant
estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation
reserves.

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type
and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount
of observable market information available to the Firm. For
instruments valued using internally developed valuation models
and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable
inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more
significant than those required when estimating the fair value of
instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level
3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation
model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of
observability of certain significant inputs requires management to
assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs
including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest
rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations,
prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.
Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3
instruments, including unobservable inputs used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment
must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation
adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s
creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations,
unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified
criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made
are typically affected by the type of product and its specific
contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within
the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility
and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other
factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a
particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its
valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of
other market participants, the methods and assumptions used
reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s
businesses and portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the
determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a
different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note
2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and
hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial
instruments.
