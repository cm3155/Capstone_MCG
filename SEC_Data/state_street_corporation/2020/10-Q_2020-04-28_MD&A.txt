MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

For additional information about our operational risk framework, refer to pages 93 to 97 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Risk Management Framework", in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Information Technology Risk Management 

We define information technology risk as the risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of information technology. Information technology risk includes risks triggered by technology non-compliance with regulatory obligations, information security and privacy incidents, business disruption, technology internal control and process gaps, technology operational events and adoption of new business technologies. 

For additional information about our information technology risk framework, refer to pages 97 to 98 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Risk Management", in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Market Risk Management 

Market risk is defined by U.S. banking regulators as the risk of loss that could result from broad market movements, such as changes in the general level of interest rates, credit spreads, FX rates or commodity prices. We are exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or asset and liability management activities. 

Information about the market risk associated with our trading activities is provided below under &#8220;Trading Activities.&#8221; Information about the market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which consists primarily of interest rate risk, is provided below under &#8220;Asset and Liability Management Activities.&#8221; 

Trading Activities 

In the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk, the level of which is a function of our overall risk appetite, business objectives and liquidity needs, our clients' requirements and market volatility, and our execution against those factors. 

For additional information about the market risk associated with our trading activities, refer to pages 98 to 99 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the FX and interest-rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into derivative instruments, including FX forward contracts, FX and interest-rate options and interest rate swaps, interest rate forward contracts, and interest rate futures. As of March 31, 2020 , the notional amount of these derivative contracts was $2.76 trillion , of which $2.74 trillion was composed of FX forward, swap and spot 

&#160;

contracts. We seek to match positions closely with the objective of tightly controlling related currency and interest rate risk. All FX contracts are valued daily at current market rates. 

Value-at-Risk and Stressed Value-at-Risk 

We use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including VaR, which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. We use a risk measurement methodology to measure trading related VaR daily. We have adopted standards for measuring trading related VaR, and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements. Our regulatory VaR-based measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period calibrated to a one-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period. 

We calculate a stressed VaR-based measure using the same model we use to calculate VaR, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelve-month periods that reflect significant financial stress. The stressed VaR model identifies the second-worst outcome occurring in the worst continuous one-year rolling period since July 2007. This stressed VaR meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling ten-day period with an outcome that is worse than 99% of other outcomes during that twelve-month period of financial stress. For each portfolio, the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the one-year time horizon that produces the largest ten-business-day VaR from within the available historical data. This historical data set includes the financial crisis of 2008, the highly volatile period surrounding the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the Standard &#38; Poor's downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt in August 2011. As the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time, future market stress events will be automatically incorporated. 

For additional information about our VaR measurement tools and methodologies, refer to pages 100 to 103 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2019 Form 10-K.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Stress Testing 

We have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that incorporates an array of techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions. We also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch, risk component, and currency pairs. We conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur, and we also perform stress testing as part of the Federal Reserve's CCAR process. Stress testing is conducted, analyzed and reported at the corporate, trading desk, division and risk-factor level (for example, exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk). 

Stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and reported to the Trading and Markets Risk Committee (TMRC). Limit breaches are addressed by ERM risk managers in conjunction with the business units, escalated as appropriate, and reviewed by the TMRC if material. In addition, we have established several action triggers that prompt review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan. 

Validation and Back-Testing 

We perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of our VaR-based model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level. This back-testing involves the comparison of estimated VaR model outputs to daily, actual profit-and-loss (P&#38;L) outcomes, observed from daily market movements. We back-test our VaR model using &#8220;clean&#8221; P&#38;L, which excludes non-trading revenue such as fees, commissions and NII, as well as estimated revenue from intra-day trading. 

Our VaR definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves, such as fees, commissions, changes to reserves and gains or losses from intra-day activity. 

We had four back-testing exceptions in the quarter ended March 31, 2020 , all of which occurred during the heightened market volatility witnessed in March 2020. There were no back-testing exceptions in the quarter ended March 31, 2019 , and one back-testing exception in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 . 

The following tables present VaR and stressed VaR associated with our trading activities for covered positions held during the quarters ended March 31, 2020 , December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 . A covered position is generally defined by U.S. banking regulators as an on-or off-balance sheet position associated with the organization's trading activities that is free of any restrictions on its tradability, but does not include intangible assets, certain credit derivatives recognized as guarantees and certain equity positions not publicly traded. 

Diversification effect in the table below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for each trading activity. This effect arises because the trading activities are not perfectly correlated.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The three month average of our stressed VaR-based measure was approximately $40 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 compared to an average of approximately $35 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 and $26 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 . The increase in the average stressed VaR compared to the quarters ended December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 , is primarily attributed to higher foreign exchange and interest rate risk positions. 

The VaR-based measures presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk in our trading activities. Overall levels of volatility have been low, both on an absolute basis and relative to the historical information observed at the beginning of the period used for the calculations. 

We may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate VaR and stressed VaR, subject to regulatory review and approval, and these modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures. The following tables present the VaR and stressed-VaR associated with our trading activities attributable to FX risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk as of March 31, 2020 , December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 . Diversification effect in the table below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for each risk category. This effect arises because the risk categories are not perfectly correlated. TABLE 31: TEN-DAY VALUE-AT-RISK ASSOCIATED WITH TRADING ACTIVITIES BY RISK FACTOR FOR COVERED POSITIONS (1)

(1) For purposes of risk attribution by component, FX refers only to the risk from market movements in period-end rates. &#160; Forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest rate risk that is captured by the measures used for interest rate risk. Accordingly, the interest rate risk embedded in these FX instruments is included in the interest rate risk component. 

Asset and Liability Management Activities 

The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable NII under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of the assets and liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. While many market factors affect the level of NII and the economic value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. Most of our NII is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses. We invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, including the currency composition of our significant non-U.S. dollar denominated client liabilities . 

We quantify NII sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio positioning. This measure compares our baseline view of NII over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast of interest rates, to a wide range of rate shocks. Table 33 , Key Interest Rates for Baseline Forecasts, presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019. Our March 31, 2020 baseline forecast assumes no changes by the Federal Reserve over the next 12 months.

In Table 34: Net Interest Income Sensitivity , we report the expected change in NII over the next twelve months from instantaneous shocks to various tenors on the yield curve, including the impacts from U.S. and non-U.S. rates. Each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of interest rate changes on our financial performance. While investment securities balances can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment assumptions change, our modeling approach in the past has been to keep our balance sheet consistent with our baseline outlook in both higher and lower rate scenarios. However, for the March 31, 2020 reporting period, we reevaluated this approach for our +100 bps shock scenario in light of the current rate environment. Under this scenario, which assumes that the Federal Reserve increases its target range by 1.00% to 1.25% along with increases by other central banks, client deposits are modeled to return to average balance levels experienced in the fourth quarter of 2019 with a corresponding reduction in cash and cash equivalents held with central banks. For the -100 bps shock scenario at March 31, 2020, we held the balance sheet consistent with our baseline outlook, including client deposits, given the amount of fiscal stimulus and monetary policy easing already implied in the baseline scenario. Another factor was that the current -100 bps scenario is impacted by assumed floors as interest rates reach zero for certain currencies including U.S. dollar .

As of March 31, 2020 , NII sensitivity is expected to benefit from both parallel increases and decreases in interest rates. Compared to March 31, 2019, our NII is more sensitive to parallel rate increases primarily driven by lower deposit beta assumptions given the current interest rate environment. Our positioning to parallel rate decreases has shifted to benefit NII driven by changes to the composition of our deposit base as well as impacts by assumed floors as interest rates in several currencies approach zero, which prevents the full extent of the rate shock to be realized. 

U.S. dollar NII sensitivity as of March 31, 2020 remains poised to benefit from a parallel rise in interest rates and our sensitivity to a parallel decrease in interest rates has shifted to a neutral NII position. Compared to March 31, 2019, our U.S. dollar NII benefit to higher rates has increased due to lower deposit betas and lower prepayments in the investment portfolio. Compared to March 31, 2019, our U.S. dollar NII sensitivity to lower rates has improved driven by changes to the composition of U.S. deposits and cash flow hedging activity which impacts our short-end sensitivities. Our U.S. declining rate scenarios are also impacted by assumed floors as U.S. interest rates approach zero. 

NII sensitivity is still positioned to benefit from changes in non-U.S. interest rates with the majority of our sensitivity derived from the short-end of the curve given deposit pricing expectations. Compared to March 31, 2019, our non-U.S. benefit to higher rates has decreased while the benefit to lower rates has increased. The decreased benefit to higher rates is driven by EMEA deposit pricing actions in addition to the treatment of excess reserves by the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank. The increased benefit to lower rates is impacted by the aforementioned deposit pricing and excess reserve changes.

EVE sensitivity is a discounted cash flow model designed to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities under a series of interest rate shocks over a long-term horizon. In the following table, we report our EVE sensitivity to 200 bps instantaneous rate shocks, relative to spot interest rates. Management compares the change in EVE sensitivity against our aggregate tier 1 and tier 2 risk-based capital, calculated in conformity with current applicable regulatory requirements. EVE sensitivity is dependent on the timing of interest and principal cash flows. Also, the measure only evaluates the spot balance sheet and does not include the impact of new business assumptions.

&#160; 

As of March 31, 2020 , EVE sensitivity remains exposed to upward shifts in interest rates. Compared to March 31, 2019 , the change in the up 200 bps instantaneous shock scenario was primarily driven by the benefit from increased liability duration from deposit modeling updates and long-term debt issuances. The down 200 bps instantaneous shock results are impacted by assumed floors as interest rates in several currencies approach zero, which prevents the full extent of the rate shock to be realized. 

Both NII sensitivity and EVE sensitivity are routinely monitored as market conditions change. For additional information about our Asset and Liability Management Activities, refer to pages 103 to 105 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Risk Management", in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Model Risk Management 

The use of models is widespread throughout the financial services industry, with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support numerous aspects of their financial decision making. The models contemporaneously represent both a significant advancement in financial management and a source of risk. In large banking organizations like us, model results influence business decisions, and model failure could have a harmful effect on our financial performance. As a result, the Model Risk Management Framework seeks to mitigate our model risk. 

For additional information about our model risk management framework, including our governance and model validation, refer to pages 105 to 106 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis 

&#160;

of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Risk Management Framework", in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Strategic Risk Management 

We define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of strategic initiatives, or lack of responsiveness to industry-wide changes. Strategic risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment; decline in market performance or changes in our business activities; and the potential secondary impacts of reputational risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit, operational, model or liquidity risks. We incorporate strategic risk into our assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes. Active management of strategic risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business. 

For additional information about our strategic risk management framework, refer to page 106 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Risk Management Framework", in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Capital 

Managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. We assess capital adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as our own internal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics. 

Our designation as a G-SIB is based on a number of factors, as evaluated by banking regulators, and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the Basel III rule. Further, like all other U.S. G-SIBs, we are also currently subject to a 2.0% leverage buffer under the Basel III rule. If we fail to exceed any regulatory buffer or surcharge, we will be subject to increased restrictions (depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments. 

Not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or financial holding company, and therefore some of our competitors may not be subject to the same capital, liquidity and other regulatory requirements. 

For additional information about our capital, refer to pages 106 to 113 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2019 Form 10-K.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

Regulatory Capital 

We and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to the U.S. Basel III framework. Provisions of the Basel III rule became effective with full implementation on January 1, 2019. We are also subject to the final market risk capital rule issued by U.S. banking regulators effective as of January 2013. 

The minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2020, including a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0%, are 8.0% for CET1 capital, 9.5% for tier 1 risk-based capital and 11.5% for total risk-based capital. Based on a calculation date of December 31, 2018, our G-SIB surcharge for 2020 was reduced to 1.0%. This reduction was driven by strategic balance sheet repositioning and risk reduction actions in 2018. To maintain the status of the Parent Company as a financial holding company, we and our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required, among other requirements, to be "well capitalized" as defined by Regulation Y and the Prompt Corrective Action Framework. 

The Basel III rule provides for two frameworks for monitoring capital adequacy: the &#8220;standardized approach" and the &#8220;advanced approaches", applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations, like us. The standardized approach prescribes standardized calculations for credit risk RWA, including specified risk weights for certain on- and off-balance sheet exposures. The advanced approaches consist of the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based Approach used for the calculation of RWA related to credit risk, and the Advanced Measurement Approach used for the calculation of RWA related to operational risk. 

The specific calculation of our and State Street Bank's risk-based capital ratios changed as the provisions of the Basel III rule related to the numerator (capital) and denominator (RWA) were phased in, and as our RWA calculated using the advanced approaches changed due to changes in methodology. These methodological changes result in differences in our reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the next that are independent of applicable changes to our capital base, our asset composition, our off-balance sheet exposures or our risk profile. 

The following table presents the regulatory capital structure, total RWA, related regulatory capital ratios and the minimum required regulatory capital ratios for us and State Street Bank, calculated under the advanced approaches and standardized approach provisions of the Basel III final rule as of the dates indicated . We are subject to the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios calculated under the standardized approach and those calculated under the advanced approaches in the assessment of our capital adequacy under applicable bank regulatory standards.

(2) Includes a CVA which reflects the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts. We used a simple CVA approach in conformity with the Basel III advanced approaches. 

(3) Under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financial condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes. An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Our CET1 capital decreased $0.10 billion as of March 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 , primarily driven by common stock repurchases and capital distributions from common and preferred stock dividends in the first quarter of 2020 , partially offset by net income and accumulated other comprehensive income. 

Our tier 1 capital decreased $0.59 billion as of March 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 under both the advanced approaches and standardized approach due to the aforementioned changes in our CET1 capital and the redemption of the Series C preferred stock. Total capital decreased under the advanced approaches and standardized approach by $0.50 billion and $0.48 billion , respectively, due to the changes in our tier 1 and tier 2 capital.

(1) Standardized approach RWA as of the periods noted above were calculated using our estimates, based on our then current interpretation of the Basel III rule. 

(2) Includes assets not in a definable category, cleared transactions, non-material portfolio, other wholesale, cash and due from, and interest-bearing deposits with banks, equity exposures and 6% credit risk supervisory charge. 

(3) Includes assets not in a definable category, cleared transactions, other wholesale, cash and due from, and interest-bearing deposits with banks and equity exposures. 

As of March 31, 2020 , total advanced approaches RWA increased $4.69 billion compared to December 31, 2019 , mainly due to an increase in credit risk, partially offset by operational risk RWA. The increase in credit risk RWA was primarily due to loans, all other, and repo-style transactions RWA. The decrease in operational risk RWA was driven by decreased frequency in the largest unit of measure. 

As of March 31, 2020 , total standardized approach RWA increased $8.76 billion compared to December 31, 2019 , mainly due to increases in both credit and market risk RWA. The increase in credit risk RWA was primarily due to loans, all other, and OTC derivatives RWA, partially offset by repo-style transactions RWA. The increase in market risk RWA was primarily due to equity market volatility in the first quarter of 2020 . 

The regulatory capital ratios as of March 31, 2020 , presented in Table 36: Regulatory Capital Structure and Related Regulatory Capital Ratios , are calculated under the standardized approach and advanced approaches in conformity with the Basel III rule. The advanced approaches-based ratios reflect calculations and determinations with respect to our capital and related matters as of March 31, 2020 , based on our and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and assumptions, collectively referred to as &#8220;advanced systems,&#8221; in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q or an annual report on Form 10-K. Significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our advanced systems may not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended. 

Our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. For example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios compared to prior periods. An operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, depending on the severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven Basel-defined unit of measure (UOM), and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular UOM, and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations. 

Due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, specific to us or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the Basel III rule will change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period. The full effects of the Basel III rule on us and State Street Bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.

Tier 1 and Supplementary Leverage Ratios 

The SLR rule requires that, as of January 1, 2018, (i) State Street Bank maintains an SLR of at least 6.0% to be well capitalized under the U.S. banking regulators&#8217; Prompt Corrective Action Framework and (ii) we maintain an SLR of at least 5.0% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. In addition to the SLR, State Street Bank is subject to a well capitalized tier 1 leverage ratio requirement of 5.0%.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity 

In 2016, the Federal Reserve released its final rule on TLAC, LTD and clean holding company requirements for U.S. domiciled G-SIBs, such as us, that is intended to improve the resiliency and resolvability of certain U.S. banking organizations through enhanced prudential standards. Among other things, the TLAC final rule requires us to comply with minimum requirements for external TLAC and external LTD effective January 1, 2019. Specifically, we must hold (1) combined eligible tier 1 regulatory capital and LTD in the amount equal to the greater of 21.5% of total RWA (18.0% minimum plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus a G-SIB surcharge calculated for these purposes under Method 1 of 1.0%) and 9.5% of total leverage exposure (7.5% minimum plus the SLR buffer of 2.0%), as defined by the SLR final rule; and (2) qualifying external LTD equal to the greater of 7.0% of RWA (6.0% minimum plus a G-SIB surcharge calculated for these purposes under method 2 of 1.0%) 

&#160;

and 4.5% of total leverage exposure, as defined by the SLR final rule. 

The following table presents external LTD and external TLAC as of March 31, 2020. On January 24, 2020 we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.400% Senior Notes due in 2030. On March 26, 2020, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.825% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2023, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.901% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2026 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.152% of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2031 .

(1) We have received a one year extension for compliance with LTD SLR to April 1, 2020; all other requirements of the TLAC final rule became effective January 1, 2019. 

We requested and received from the Federal Reserve, an extension from January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2020, for compliance with the LTD SLR requirements of the TLAC final rule. In granting the extension request, the Federal Reserve noted that the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA) was signed into law in May 2018. Under this legislation, the Federal Reserve and the other U.S. federal banking agencies must promulgate rules to exclude certain central bank placements from the calculation of SLR for custodial banks such as us. The Federal Reserve and the other U.S. federal banking agencies adopted that final rule in November 2019; the rule becomes effective on April 1, 2020. Accordingly, we requested and received an additional three-month extension from January 1, 2020 to April 1, 2020, for compliance with the LTD SLR requirements of the rule. This regulatory change is expected to reduce the LTD we are required to hold as calculated under the requirements generally in effect through March 31, 2020.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Regulatory Developments 

In April 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule which would replace the current 2.0% supplementary leverage ratio buffer for G-SIBs, with a buffer equal to 50% of their G-SIB surcharge, which is currently 1.0% for us. This proposal would also make conforming modifications to our TLAC and eligible LTD requirements applicable to G-SIBs. 

In November 2019, the Federal Reserve and the other U.S. federal banking agencies adopted a final rule that establishes a deduction for central bank deposits from a custodial banking organization&#8217;s total leverage exposure equal to the lesser of (i) the total amount of funds the custodial banking organization and its consolidated subsidiaries have on deposit at qualifying central banks and (ii) the total amount of client funds on deposit at the custodial banking organization that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts. The rule became effective on April 1, 2020. For the quarter ended March 31, 2020 , we estimated that $65.03 billion of average balances held on deposit at central banks would have been excluded from the SLR denominator, which would have impacted the SLR by approximately 171 bps. Accordingly, the estimated proforma SLR would have been 7.1% as of March 31, 2020.The TLAC and LTD that we are required to hold as calculated under the current requirements will also be reduced as a consequence of the rule . 

Also in November 2019, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking agencies issued a final rule to implement the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk as a replacement of the Current Exposure Method for calculating exposure-at-default of derivatives exposures. We have not estimated the impact of the final rule as its mandatory compliance date is January 1, 2022, and it is expected to be accompanied by other revisions to the Basel III regime. 

On March 4, 2020, the Agencies issued the SCB final rule that will replace, under the Standardized Approach, the current Capital Conservation Buffer (2.5%) with a SCB calculated as the difference between the institution&#8217;s starting and lowest projected CET1 ratio under the CCAR severely adverse scenario plus the Bank&#8217;s planned dividend payments (as a percentage of RWA) from the fourth through seventh quarter of the CCAR planning horizon. The SCB requirement will become effective in the fourth quarter of 2020 (it must be updated on October 1 each year) and will be floored at 2.5%. Based on the results of the 2019 CCAR cycle, State Street estimated that it would be subject to an SCB of 2.5%. 

The Federal Reserve also recently took action to support the flow of credit to the economy and liquidity in markets impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic: following the launch of the MMLF program, the Federal 

&#160;

Reserve issued a rule on March 19, 2020, allowing bank holding companies to exclude assets purchased with the MMLF program from their risk-weighted assets and total leverage exposure. Additionally, the SLR interim final rule released on April 1, 2020 will allow bank holding companies to deduct their deposits with the Federal Reserve and their investments in U.S. Treasuries from their total leverage exposure from the second quarter of 2020 through the first quarter of 2021. The U.S. Treasuries deduction will be applied in addition to the central bank deposits relief referred to above that is coming into effect in the second quarter of 2020. For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we estimated that combined, the two rules would have improved our SLR by 223 bps. 

On March 27, 2020, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision announced the deferral of the implementation of the revisions to the Basel III framework to January 1, 2023. No conforming communication has been made by the Agencies as of yet.

(2) The preferred stock and corresponding depositary shares may be redeemed at our option in whole, but not in part, prior to the redemption date upon the occurrence of a regulatory capital treatment event, as defined in the certificate of designation, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation price per share and liquidation price per depositary share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. 

We redeemed all outstanding Series C non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock as of March 15, 2020 at a redemption price of $500 million ($100,000 per share equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share) plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The difference of $9 million between the redemption value and the net carrying value resulted in an EPS impact of approximately ($0.03) per share in the first quarter of 2020.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Common Stock 

In June 2019, the Federal Reserve issued a non-objection to our capital plan submitted as part of the 2019 CCAR submission; and in connection with that capital plan, our Board approved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 (the 2019 Program). We repurchased $500 million of our common stock in the first quarter of 2020 . On March 16, 2020, we announced that we temporarily suspended our common stock repurchase program, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In June 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a conditional non-objection to our 2018 capital plan; and in connection with that capital plan, our Board approved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1.2 billion of our common stock through June 30, 2019 (the 2018 Program), under which we repurchased $300 million of our common stock in the first quarter of 2019. 

The table below presents the activity under our common stock purchase program during the periods indicated:

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. In addition, banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. For information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks, refer to pages 52 and 53 included under Item 5, Market for Registrant&#8217;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, in our 2019 Form 10-K, and to Note 15 on pages 159 to 161 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements 

&#160;

and Supplementary Data, in our 2019 Form 10-K. Our common stock and preferred stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount thereof, are subject to consideration and approval by the Board at the relevant times. 

Stock purchases may be made using various types of mechanisms, including open market purchases, accelerated share repurchases or transactions off market and may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs. The timing of stock purchases, types of transactions and number of shares purchased will depend on several factors, including, market conditions and our capital positions, financial performance and investment opportunities. The common stock purchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

On behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring processes. The aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $376.98 billion and $367.90 billion as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. We require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. We hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and the collateral is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. We revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the borrower. We held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $397.80 billion and $385.43 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

The cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. Of the collateral of $397.80 billion and $385.43 billion , referenced above, $46.03 billion and $45.66 billion was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. We or our

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

agents held $49.26 billion and $48.89 billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase agreements as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

Additional information about our securities finance activities and other off-balance sheet arrangements is provided in Notes 8 , 10, and 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q . 

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. 

Certain of our accounting policies, by their nature, require management to make judgments, involving significant estimates and assumptions, about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements. 

Based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions, the more significant accounting policies applied by us have been identified by management as those associated with recurring fair value measurements, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies and allowance for credit losses. These accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. An understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

In January 2020, we adopted ASC 326, which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology. We maintain an allowance for credit losses to support our on-balance sheet credit exposures, including financial assets held at amortized cost and investment securities held to-maturity. We also maintain an allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit to support our off-balance credit exposure. The two components together represent the allowance for credit losses. 

Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, factors and forecasts then prevailing 

&#160;

may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods. We estimate credit losses over the contractual life of the financial asset while factoring in prepayment activity where supported by data over a three year reasonable and supportable forecast period. We utilize a baseline, upside and downside scenario which are applied based on a probability weighting, in order to better reflect management&#8217;s expectation of expected credit losses given existing market conditions and the changes in the economic environment. The multiple scenarios are based on a three year horizon (or less depending on contractual maturity) and then revert linearly over a two year period to a ten-year historical average thereafter. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications, but includes prepayment assumptions where applicable. 

Additional information about our allowance for credit losses is provided in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. 

For additional information about these significant accounting policies refer to pages 115 to 117, &#8220;Significant Accounting Estimates&#8221; included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS 

Information with respect to recent accounting developments is provided in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q .

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The information provided under Financial Condition - Market Risk Management in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis, included in this Form 10-Q, is incorporated by reference herein. For more information on our market risk refer to pages 98 to 105 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information related to us and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. For the quarter ended March 31, 2020 , our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2020 . 

We have established and maintain internal control over financial reporting as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In the ordinary course of business, we routinely enhance our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting by either upgrading our current systems or implementing new systems. Changes have been made and may be made to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting as a result of these efforts. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020 , no change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

STATE STREET CORPORATION 

CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(UNAUDITED) 

Note 1 . &#160; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of State Street Corporation conform to U.S. GAAP. State Street Corporation, the Parent Company, is a financial holding company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in these notes to consolidated financial statements to &#8220;State Street,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or similar references mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Our principal banking subsidiary is State Street Bank. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial and risk factor information included in our 2019 Form 10-K, which we previously filed with the SEC. 

The consolidated financial statements accompanying these condensed notes are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary for a fair statement of the consolidated results of operations in these financial statements, have been made. Certain previously reported amounts presented in this Form 10-Q have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation. Events occurring subsequent to the date of our consolidated statement of condition were evaluated for potential recognition or disclosure in our consolidated financial statements through the date we filed this Form 10-Q with the SEC. 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain of our significant accounting policies that may materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses. As a result of unanticipated events or circumstances, actual results could differ from those estimates. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ. 

Our consolidated statement of condition as of December 31, 2019 included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date, but does not include all notes required by U.S. GAAP for a complete set of consolidated financial statements. 

Recent Accounting Developments 

Relevant standards that were adopted in the first quarter of 2020: 

In January 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326): 

&#160;

Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as CECL methodology . This standard requires immediate recognition of expected credit losses for certain financial assets and off-balance sheet commitments, including trade and other receivables, loans and commitments, held-to-maturity debt securities, and other financial assets held at amortized cost at the reporting date, to be measured based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Credit losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded as an allowance against the amortized cost basis of the security, limited to the amount by which the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value, and reversal of impairment losses are allowed when the credit of the issuer improves. 

ASC 326 was adopted using a modified retrospective method of transition for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and off balance sheet commitments, which requires the impact of applying the standard on prior periods to be reflected in opening retained earnings upon adoption. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020 are presented under the CECL methodology in ASC 326, while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. Additional information about the reporting for prior periods can be found in our 2019 Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 20, 2020. The impact of transitioning to ASC 326 on the consolidated financial statements was an increase in the allowance for credit losses and a decrease in retained earnings of $ 3 million primarily arising from: 

&#8226; 

An increase of $ 1 million in the allowance for credit losses related to loans and other financial assets held at amortized cost. 

&#8226; 

An increase of $ 2 million in the allowance for credit losses related to off-balance sheet commitments 

In January 2020, we adopted the remaining provisions of ASU 2018-13 - Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value, specifically the provisions of the standard that add disclosures. We previously adopted the provisions of the standard that eliminated or amended disclosures as of December 31, 2018. There are no material impacts to the disclosures as a result of the adoption. 

In January 2020, we adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. There are no material impacts to our financial statements as a result of the adoption. 

State Street Corporation | 53 

STATE STREET CORPORATION 

CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(UNAUDITED) 

In January 2020, we adopted ASU 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. There are no material impacts to our financial statements as a result of the adoption. 

ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting is effective as of March 12, 2020. The guidance provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the existing guidance in U.S. GAAP on contract modifications and hedge accounting in relation to the transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance also allows a one-time election to sell and/or reclassify to AFS or trading HTM debt securities that reference an interest rate affected by reference rate reform. There were no material impacts to our financial statements as a result of the adoption; we are evaluating the one-time election to sell/transfer HTM securities impacted by reference rate reform. 

Note 2 . Fair Value 

Fair Value Measurements 

We carry trading account assets and liabilities, AFS debt securities, certain equity securities and various types of derivative financial instruments, at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis. Changes in the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income or as components of AOCI within shareholders' equity in our consolidated statement of condition. 

We measure fair value for the above-described financial assets and liabilities in conformity with U.S. GAAP that governs the measurement of the fair value of financial instruments. Management believes that its valuation techniques and underlying assumptions used to measure fair value conform to the provisions of U.S. GAAP. We categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value based on a prescribed three-level valuation hierarchy. For information about our valuation techniques for financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value and the fair value hierarchy, refer to pages 128 to 134 in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

The following tables present information with respect to our financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis as of the dates indicated:

Note 3 . Investment Securities 

Investment securities held by us are classified as either trading account assets, AFS , HTM or equity securities held at fair value at the time of purchase and reassessed periodically, based on management&#8217;s intent. For additional information on our accounting for investment securities, refer to page 135 in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Trading account assets are carried at fair value. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading account assets are recorded in foreign exchange trading services revenue in our consolidated statement of income. AFS securities are carried at fair value, with any allowance for credit losses recorded through the consolidated statement of income and after-tax net unrealized non-credit related gains and losses recorded in AOCI. Gains or losses related on sales of AFS investment securities are computed using the specific identification method and are recorded in gains (losses) related to investment securities, net in our consolidated statement of income. 

We participated in the Federal Reserve's MMLF program in the first quarter of 2020 and purchased $ 27 billion of investment securities under that program. 

HTM investment securities are carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, with any allowance for credit losses recorded through the consolidated statement of income. As of March 31, 2020, we recognized an allowance for credit losses on HTM investment securities of $ 4 million all related to MMLF program assets.

Interest income related to debt securities is recognized in our consolidated statement of income using the effective interest method, or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the contractual or estimated life of the security. The level rate of return considers any non-refundable fees or costs, as well as purchase premiums or discounts, adjusted as prepayments occur, resulting in amortization or accretion, accordingly.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

We conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether an allowance for credit losses is required. HTM securities are evaluated for expected credit loss utilizing a probability of default methodology, or discounted cash flows assessed against the amortized cost of the investment security excluding accrued interest. Refer to note 5 for additional information. An AFS security is impaired when the current fair value of an individual security is below its amortized cost basis. An allowance for credit losses on impaired AFS securities is recorded when the present value of expected future cash flows of the investment security is less than its amortized cost basis, limited to the amount by which the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value. Investment securities will be written down to fair value through the consolidated statement of income when management intends to sell (or may be required to sell) the securities before they recover in value. 

For additional information about the review of securities under previous other-than-temporary impairment guidance, refer to pages 140 to 141 in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

We recorded an allowance for credit losses of approximately $ 4 million on our HTM securities under the new CECL guidance as of March 31, 2020. We recorded approximately $ 1 million of other-than-temporary-impairment (OTTI) in the first quarter of 2019, which resulted from adverse changes in the timing of expected future cash flows from non-U.S. mortgage- and asset backed securities. 

Our review of impaired AFS investment securities generally includes: 

&#8226; 

the identification and evaluation of securities that have indications of potential impairment, such as issuer-specific concerns, including deteriorating financial condition or bankruptcy; 

&#8226; 

the analysis of expected future cash flows of securities, based on quantitative and qualitative factors; 

&#8226; 

the analysis of the collectability of those future cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts; 

&#8226; 

the analysis of the underlying collateral for MBS and ABS; 

&#8226; 

the analysis of individual impaired securities, including the anticipated recovery period and the magnitude of the overall price decline; 

&#8226; 

evaluation of factors or triggers that could cause individual securities to be deemed impaired and those that would not support impairment; and 

&#160;

&#8226; 

documentation of the results of these analyses. 

Substantially all of our investment securities portfolio is composed of debt securities. A critical component of our assessment of impairment of these debt securities is the identification of credit-impaired securities for which management does not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. 

Debt securities that are not deemed to be credit-impaired are subject to additional management analysis to assess whether management intends to sell, or, more likely than not, would be required to sell, the security before the expected recovery of its amortized cost basis. 

With respect to certain classes of debt securities, primarily U.S. Treasuries and agency securities (mainly issued by U.S. Government entities and agencies, as well as G7 sovereigns), the bank considers the history of credit losses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, which may indicate that the expectation that nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is or continues to be zero, even if the U.S. government were to technically default. Therefore, for those securities, the bank does not record expected credit losses. 

Please refer to Note 5 for additional discussion of the credit quality indicators and the factors utilized when assessing the HTM and AFS investment securities for impairment. 

After a review of the investment portfolio, taking into consideration current economic conditions, adverse situations that might affect our ability to fully collect principal and interest, the timing of future payments, the credit quality and performance of the collateral underlying MBS and ABS and other relevant factors, management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the investment securities portfolio and the resulting gross pre-tax unrealized losses of $ 496 million related to 1,024 securities as of March 31, 2020 to not be the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities. 

Note 4 . Loans 

We segregate our loans into two segments: commercial and financial loans and commercial real estate loans. We further classify commercial and financial loans as loans to investment funds, senior secured bank loans (otherwise known as leveraged loans), loans to municipalities and other. These classifications reflect their risk characteristics, their initial measurement attributes and the methods we use to monitor and assess credit risk. For additional information on our loans, including our internal risk-rating system used to assess our risk of credit loss for each loan, refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q and for prior periods refer

(2) Loans to investment funds Include $ 8,685 million and $ 3,256 million of overdrafts as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

The commercial and financial segment is composed primarily of floating-rate loans to mutual fund and private equity fund clients, purchased senior secured bank loans and loans to municipalities. Investment fund lending is composed of revolving credit lines providing liquidity and leverage to mutual fund and private equity fund clients. 

Certain loans are pledged as collateral for access to the Federal Reserve's discount window. As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the loans pledged as collateral totaled $ 8.07 billion and $ 6.75 billion , respectively. 

As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , we had no loans on non-accrual status. As of March 31, 2020 , we had one loan with interest past due 30 days or more. As of December 31, 2019 , we had no loans 30 days or more contractually past due. 

In certain circumstances, we restructure troubled loans by granting concessions to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Once restructured, the loans are generally considered impaired until their maturity, regardless of whether the borrowers perform under the modified terms of the loans. There were no loans modified in troubled debt restructurings as of both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . 

We review loans for indicators of impairment. Loans where indicators exist are evaluated individually 

&#160;

for impairment at least quarterly. For those loans where no such indicators are identified, the loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. As of March 31, 2020 , we had two loans for $ 35 million in the commercial and financial segment that were individually evaluated for impairment and deemed to be impaired. We recorded specific reserves of $ 2 million on these loans. As of December 31, 2019 , we had one loan for $ 25 million in the commercial and financial segment that was individually evaluated for impairment and deemed to be impaired. We recorded a specific reserve of $ 1 million on that loan. 

Loans are reviewed on a regular basis, and any provisions for credit losses that are recorded reflect management's estimate of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered appropriate to absorb estimated expected losses in the loan portfolio. 

Note 5 . Allowance for Credit Losses 

We recognize an allowance for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326 for financial assets held at amortized cost, AFS securities and off-balance sheet commitments. Further discussion of our adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, including the impact on our consolidated financial statements, is provided in Note 1. 

When the allowance is recorded, a provision for credit losses expense is recognized in net income. The allowance for credit losses for financial assets represents the portion of the amortized cost basis, including accrued interest for financial assets held at amortized cost, which management does not expect to recover due to expected credit losses and is presented on the statement of condition as an offset to the amortized cost basis. The accrued interest balance is presented separately on the statement of condition within accrued interest and fees receivable. The allowance for off-balance sheet commitments is presented within other liabilities. 

We have elected to not record an allowance on accrued interest for HTM and AFS securities. Accrued Interest on these securities is reversed against interest income when payment on a security is delinquent for greater than 90 days from the date of payment. 

The allowance for credit losses may be determined using various methods, including discounted cash flow methods, loss-rate methods, probability-of-default methods, or other methods as determined by us. The method used to estimate expected credit losses may vary depending on the type of financial asset, our ability to predict the timing of cash flows, and the information available to us. We estimate our expected credit losses using the probability-of-default method for the majority of our financial assets and the discounted cash flow method for our structured products portfolio which are

included in investment securities held-to-maturity on the statement of condition. 

We measure expected credit losses of financial assets on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristic exist. Each reporting period, we assess whether the assets in the pool continue to display similar risk characteristics. 

For a financial asset that does not share risk characteristics with other assets, expected credit losses are measured based on net realizable value, that is, the difference between the discounted value of the expected future cash flows, utilizing the effective interest rate, and the amortized cost basis of the asset. When the asset is collateral dependent, that is, when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the asset and the fair value of the collateral, adjusted for the estimated costs to sell. 

Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods. 

We estimate credit losses over the contractual life of the financial asset while factoring in prepayment activity where supported by data over a three year reasonable and supportable forecast period. We utilize a baseline, upside and downside scenario which are applied based on a probability weighting, in order to better reflect management&#8217;s expectation of expected credit losses given existing market conditions and the changes in the economic environment. The multiple scenarios are based on a three year horizon (or less depending on contractual maturity) and then revert linearly over a two year period to a ten-year historical average thereafter. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications, but includes prepayment assumptions where applicable. 

Loans 

We segregate our portfolio of loans held for investment into two portfolio segments, the commercial and financing and commercial real estate loan portfolio segment. These two segments are further disaggregated into loan classes, the level at which we monitor and assess credit risk based on risk characteristics. 

We further classify commercial and financing loans as loans to investment funds, senior secured bank loans also referred to as leveraged loans, loans to municipalities, and other. These classifications reflect their risk characteristics, their initial measurement attributes and the methods we use to monitor and assess credit risk. Please refer to Note 4 for additional discussion of the loan portfolio. 

&#160;

Securities 

HTM and AFS investment securities are assessed for credit loss based on the security type discussed in Note 3. We monitor the credit quality of the HTM and AFS investment securities through the use of credit ratings on a quarterly basis. As of March 31, 2020, 99 % of our HTM and AFS investment portfolio is considered investment grade. 

Other Assets 

The remainder of our financial assets held at amortized cost are disaggregated based on product type. We assess credit risk based on the entire balance within fees receivable. 

Securities purchased under a resale agreement and securities-financing within our principal business utilized the collateral maintenance provisions included within ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. An allowance for credit losses is recognized for any remaining exposure based on counterparty type. 

Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposure 

The allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures, recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated statement of condition, represents management&#8217;s&#8217; estimate of credit losses primarily in outstanding letters and lines of credit and other credit-enhancement facilities provided to our clients and outstanding as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is evaluated quarterly by management. Factors considered in evaluating the appropriate level of this allowance are similar to those considered with respect to the allowance for credit losses on financial assets held at amortized cost. Provisions to maintain the allowance at a level considered by us to be appropriate to absorb estimated credit losses in outstanding facilities are recorded in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statement of income. 

Credit Quality 

Credit quality for financial assets held at amortized cost are continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses as reported in our consolidated statement of condition is adjusted by provision for credit losses, which is reported in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of principal amounts, net of recoveries. 

We use an internal risk-rating system to assess our risk of credit loss for each financial asset. The risk-rating process incorporates the use of risk-rating tools in conjunction with management judgment. Qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a systematic manner and following a formal review and approval process, an internal credit rating based on our credit scale is assigned.

(UNAUDITED) 

When computing allowance levels, credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes asset pools based on loss history, delinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods evaluations of the overall asset portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods. 

Credit quality is assessed and monitored at least annually, by evaluating various attributes in order to enable the earliest possible detection of any concerns with the customer&#8217;s credit rating. The results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and transactions with counterparties and in our process for estimation of expected credit losses. 

In assessing the risk rating assigned to each financial asset held at amortized cost, among the factors considered are the borrower&#8217;s debt capacity, collateral coverage, payment history and delinquency experience, financial flexibility and earnings strength, the expected amounts and source of repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, if any, and the industry and geography in which the borrower operates. These factors are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, and involve subjective assessment and interpretation. Credit counterparties are evaluated and risk-rated on an individual basis at least annually. 

Management regularly reviews financial assets in the portfolio to assess credit quality indicators and to determine appropriate loans classification and grading in accordance with applicable bank regulations. Our internal risk rating methodology assigns risk ratings ranging from Investment Grade, Speculative, Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful and Loss. 

&#8226; 

Investment Grade . Assets consisting of counterparties with strong credit quality and low expected credit risk and probability of default. Ratings apply to counterparties with a strong capacity to support the timely repayment of any financial commitment. Approximately 83% of our loans were rated as investment grade as of March 31, 2020 with external credit ratings, or equivalent, of "BBB-" or better. 

&#8226; 

Speculative . Assets consisting of counterparties that face ongoing uncertainties or exposure to business, financial or economic downturns. However, these counterparties may have financial flexibility or access to financial alternatives, which allow for financial commitments to be met. Assets rated as 

&#160;

speculative, which is approximately 17% of our loans as of March 31, 2020 , primarily comprises our senior secured loans. Approximately 84% of those senior secured loans have an external credit rating, or equivalent, of "BB" or "B" as of March 31, 2020 . 

&#8226; 

Special Mention. Assets consisting of counterparties with potential weaknesses that, if uncorrected, may result in deterioration of repayment prospects. 

&#8226; 

Substandard. Assets consisting of counterparties with well-defined weakness that jeopardizes repayment with the possibility we will sustain some loss. 

&#8226; 

Doubtful. Assets consisting of counterparties with well-defined weakness which make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable. 

&#8226; 

Loss. Assets which are uncollectible or have little value.

Note 8 . &#160; Derivative Financial Instruments 

We use derivative financial instruments to support our clients' needs and to manage our interest rate and currency risks. These financial instruments consist of FX contracts such as forwards, futures and options contracts; interest rate contracts such as interest rate swaps (cross currency and single currency) and futures; 

State Street Corporation | 70 

STATE STREET CORPORATION 

CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(UNAUDITED) 

and other derivative contracts. Derivative instruments used for risk management purposes that are highly effective in offsetting the risk being hedged are generally designated as hedging instruments in hedge accounting relationships while others are economic hedges and not designated in hedge accounting relationships. For additional information on our derivative financial instruments, including derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, refer to pages 147 to 148 in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments 

For additional information on our derivatives designated as hedging instruments, including our risk management objectives and hedging documentation methodologies, refer to page 148 in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Fair Value Hedges 

Derivatives designated as fair value hedges are utilized to mitigate the risk of changes in the fair values of recognized assets and liabilities, including long-term debt, AFS securities, and foreign currency investment securities. We use interest rate or FX contracts in this manner to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of hedged items caused by changes in interest rates or FX rates. 

Changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in fair value of the hedged item due to changes in the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the same line item. If a hedge is terminated, all remaining adjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged item shall be amortized over a period that is consistent with the amortization of other discounts or premiums associated with the hedged item . 

Cash Flow Hedges 

Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are utilized to offset the variability of cash flows of recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions. We have entered into FX contracts to hedge the change in cash flows attributable to FX movements in foreign currency denominated investment securities. Additionally, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the forecasted cash flows associated with LIBOR indexed floating-rate loans. The interest rate swaps synthetically convert the loan interest receipts from a variable-rate to a fixed-rate, thereby mitigating the risk attributable to changes in the LIBOR benchmark rate. 

Changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in AOCI and 

&#160;

then reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings and are presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the hedge relationship is terminated, the change in fair value on the derivative recorded in AOCI is reclassified into earnings consistent with the timing of the hedged item. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original hedge terms, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. As of March 31, 2020 , the maximum maturity date of the underlying loans is approximately 4 years . 

Net Investment Hedges 

Derivatives categorized as net investment hedges are entered into to protect the net investment in our foreign operations against adverse changes in exchange rates. We use FX forward contracts to convert the foreign currency risk to U.S. dollars to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in FX rates. The changes in fair value of the FX forward contracts are recorded, net of taxes, in the foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive income (OCI).

Derivatives Netting and Credit Contingencies 

Netting 

Derivatives receivable and payable as well as cash collateral from the same counterparty are netted in the consolidated statement of condition for those counterparties with whom we have legally binding master netting agreements in place. In addition to cash collateral received and transferred presented on a net basis, we also receive and transfer collateral in the form of securities, which mitigate credit risk but are not eligible for netting. Additional information on netting is provided in Note 9 . 

Credit Contingencies 

Certain of our derivatives are subject to master netting agreements with our derivative counterparties containing credit risk-related contingent features, which requires us to maintain an investment grade credit rating with the various credit rating agencies. If our rating falls below investment grade, we would be in violation of the provisions, and counterparties to the derivatives could request immediate payment or demand full overnight collateralization on derivatives instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivatives with credit contingent features and in a liability position as of March 31, 2020 totaled approximately $ 5.34 billion , against which we provided $ 3.80 billion of collateral in the normal course of business. If our credit related contingent features underlying these agreements were triggered as of March 31, 2020 , the maximum additional collateral we would be required to post to our counterparties is approximately $ 1.54 billion .

The securities transferred under resale and repurchase agreements typically are U.S. Treasury, agency and agency MBS. In our principal securities borrowing and lending arrangements, the securities transferred are predominantly equity securities and some corporate debt securities. The fair value of the securities transferred may increase in value to an amount greater than the amount received under our repurchase and securities lending arrangements, which exposes us to counterparty risk. We require the review of the price of the underlying securities in relation to the carrying value of the repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements on a daily basis and when appropriate, adjust the cash or security to be obtained or returned to counterparties that is reflective of the required collateral levels.

In certain cases, we participate in securities finance transactions as a principal. As a principal, we borrow securities from the lending client and then lend such securities to the subsequent borrower, either our client or a broker/dealer. Our right to receive and obligation to return collateral in connection with our securities lending transactions are recorded in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated statement of condition. As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , we had approximately $12.58 billion and $ 18.52 billion , respectively, of collateral provided and approximately $ 8.06 billion and $ 10.77 billion , respectively, of collateral received from

clients in connection with our participation in principal securities finance transactions. 

FICC Guarantee 

As a sponsoring member in the FICC member program, we provide a guarantee to FICC in the event a customer fails to perform its obligations under a transaction. In order to minimize the risk associated with this guarantee, sponsored members acting as buyers generally grant a security interest in the subject securities received under and held on their behalf by State Street. For additional information on our repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, please refer to Note 9 . 

Note 11 . Contingencies 

Legal and Regulatory Matters 

In the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are involved in disputes, litigation, and governmental or regulatory inquiries and investigations, both pending and threatened. These matters, if resolved adversely against us or settled, may result in monetary awards or payments, fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices. The resolution or settlement of these matters is inherently difficult to predict. Based on our assessment of these pending matters, we do not believe that the amount of any judgment, settlement or other action arising from any pending matter is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. However, an adverse outcome or development in certain of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which such matter is resolved, or an accrual is determined to be required, on our consolidated financial condition, or on our reputation. 

We evaluate our needs for accruals of loss contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings on a case-by-case basis. When we have a liability that we deem probable, and we deem the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated as of the date of our consolidated financial statements, we accrue our estimate of the amount of loss. We also consider a loss probable and establish an accrual when we make, or intend to make, an offer of settlement. Once established, an accrual is subject to subsequent adjustment as a result of additional information. The resolution of legal and regulatory proceedings and the amount of reasonably estimable loss (or range thereof) are inherently difficult to predict, especially in the early stages of proceedings. Even if a loss is probable, an amount (or range) of loss might not be reasonably estimated until the later stages of the proceeding due to many factors such as the presence of complex or novel legal theories, the discretion of governmental authorities in seeking sanctions or negotiating resolutions in civil and criminal matters, the pace and

timing of discovery and other assessments of facts and the procedural posture of the matter (collectively, "factors influencing reasonable estimates"). 

As of March 31, 2020 , our aggregate accruals for loss contingencies for legal, regulatory and related matters totaled approximately $ 146 million , including potential fines by government agencies and civil litigation with respect to the matters specifically discussed below. To the extent that we have established accruals in our consolidated statement of condition for probable loss contingencies, such accruals may not be sufficient to cover our ultimate financial exposure associated with any settlements or judgments. Any such ultimate financial exposure, or proceedings to which we may become subject in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, on our future consolidated financial statements or on our reputation. 

As of March 31, 2020 , for those matters for which we have accrued probable loss contingencies (including the Invoicing Matter described below) and for other matters for which loss is reasonably possible (but not probable) in future periods, and for which we are able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, our estimate of the aggregate reasonably possible loss (in excess of any accrued amounts) ranges up to approximately $ 50 million . Our estimate with respect to the aggregate reasonably possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties, which may change quickly and significantly from time to time, particularly if and as we engage with applicable governmental agencies or plaintiffs in connection with a proceeding. Also, the matters underlying the reasonably possible loss will change from time to time. As a result, actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. 

In certain pending matters, it is not currently feasible to reasonably estimate the amount or a range of reasonably possible loss, and such losses, which may be significant, are not included in the estimate of reasonably possible loss discussed above. This is due to, among other factors, the factors influencing reasonable estimates described above. An adverse outcome in one or more of the matters for which we have not estimated the amount or a range of reasonably possible loss, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, on our future consolidated financial statements or on our reputation. Given that our actual losses from any legal or regulatory proceeding for which we have provided an estimate of the reasonably possible loss could significantly exceed such estimate, and given that we cannot estimate reasonably possible loss for all legal and regulatory proceedings as to which we may be subject now or in the future, no conclusion as to our ultimate exposure from current pending or potential 

&#160;

legal or regulatory proceedings should be drawn from the current estimate of reasonably possible loss. 

The following discussion provides information with respect to significant legal, governmental and regulatory matters. 

Invoicing Matter 

In 2015, we determined that we had incorrectly invoiced clients for certain expenses. We have reimbursed most of our affected customers for those expenses, and we have implemented enhancements to our billing processes. In connection with our enhancements to our billing processes, we continue to review historical billing practices and may from time to time identify additional remediation. In 2017, we identified an additional area of incorrect expense billing associated with mailing services in our retirement services business. We currently expect the cumulative total of our payments to customers for these invoicing errors, including the error in the retirement services business, to be at least $ 380 million , all of which has been paid or is accrued. However, we may identify additional remediation costs. 

In March 2017, a purported class action was commenced against us alleging that our invoicing practices violated duties owed to retirement plan customers under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. In addition, we have received a purported class action demand letter alleging that our invoicing practices were unfair and deceptive under Massachusetts law. A class of customers, or particular customers, may assert that we have not paid to them all amounts incorrectly invoiced, and may seek double or treble damages under Massachusetts law. 

We are also cooperating with investigations by governmental and regulatory authorities on these matters, including the civil and criminal divisions of the DOJ and the DOL, which reviews could result in significant fines or other sanctions, civil and criminal, against us. In June 2019, we reached an agreement with the SEC to settle its claims that we violated the recordkeeping provisions of Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and caused violations of Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act and Rules 31a-1(a) and 31a-1(b) thereunder in connection with our overcharges of customers which are registered investment companies. In reaching this settlement, we neither admitted nor denied the claims contained in the SEC&#8217;s order, and agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $ 40 million . Also in June 2019, we reached an agreement with the Massachusetts Attorney General&#8217;s office to resolve its claims related to this matter. In reaching this settlement, we neither admitted nor denied the claims in the order, and agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $ 5.5 million . The costs associated with these settlements were within our related previously established accruals for loss contingencies.

(UNAUDITED) 

The SEC and Massachusetts Attorney General&#8217;s office settlements both recognize that the payment of $ 48.8 million in disgorgement and interest is satisfied by our direct reimbursements of our customers. 

In January 2020, the DOJ outlined a framework for a possible resolution of their review. We are discussing the terms of a potential settlement of this matter with the DOJ. Separately, we have inquired of the DOL as to the status of their review but have not entered into settlement discussions with the DOL. There can be no assurance that any settlement with the DOJ or DOL will be reached on financial or other terms acceptable to us or at all. The aggregate amount of penalties that may potentially be imposed upon us in connection with the resolution of all outstanding investigations into our historical billing practices is not currently known. We have established a legal accrual with respect to the pending governmental investigations and civil litigation with respect to this matter; however, our ultimate liability with respect to this matter might be significantly in excess of our current accrual. Government authorities have significant discretion in criminal and civil matters as to the fines and other penalties they may seek to impose. Any resolution of the DOJ and DOL claims may involve penalties that could be a significant percentage, or a multiple of, all or a portion of the overcharge. The severity of such fines or penalties could take into account factors such as the amount or duration of our incorrect invoicing and the government&#8217;s or regulators&#8217; assessment of the conduct of our employees, as well as prior conduct such as that which resulted in our January 2017 deferred prosecution agreement and settlement of civil claims regarding our indirect FX business. 

The outcome of any of these proceedings and, in particular, any criminal sanction could materially adversely affect our results of operations and could have significant additional consequences for our business and reputation. 

Federal Reserve/Massachusetts Division of Banks Written Agreement 

On June 1, 2015, we entered into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve and the Massachusetts Division of Banks relating to deficiencies identified in our compliance programs with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, Anti-Money Laundering regulations and U.S. economic sanctions regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. As part of this enforcement action, we have been required to, among other things, implement improvements to our compliance programs. If we fail to comply with the terms of the written agreement, we may become subject to fines and other regulatory sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect on us. 

&#160;

Shareholder Litigation 

A shareholder of ours has filed a derivative complaint against the Company&#8217;s past and present officers and directors to recover alleged losses incurred by the Company relating to the invoicing matter and to the Ohio public retirement plans matter. 

Income Taxes 

In determining our provision for income taxes, we make certain judgments and interpretations with respect to tax laws in jurisdictions in which we have business operations. Because of the complex nature of these laws, in the normal course of our business, we are subject to challenges from U.S. and non-U.S. income tax authorities regarding the amount of income taxes due. These challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of taxable income among tax jurisdictions. We recognize a tax benefit when it is more likely than not that our position will result in a tax deduction or credit. Unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $ 146 million as of March 31, 2020 decreased from $ 149 million as of December 31, 2019 . 

We are presently under audit by a number of tax authorities, and the Internal Revenue Service is currently reviewing our U.S. income tax returns for the tax years 2017 and 2018. The earliest tax year open to examination in jurisdictions where we have material operations is 2012. Management believes that we have sufficiently accrued liabilities as of March 31, 2020 for potential tax exposures.

Note 12 . Variable Interest Entities 

For additional information on our variable interest entities (VIEs), refer to pages 158 to 159 in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, "Variable Interest Entities", in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Tax Exempt Investment Program 

In the normal course of our business, we structure and sell certificated interests in pools of tax exempt investment grade assets, principally to our mutual fund clients. We structure these pools as partnership trusts, and the assets and liabilities of the trusts are recorded in our consolidated statement of condition as AFS investment securities and other short-term borrowings. As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , we carried AFS investment securities, composed of securities related to state and political subdivisions, with a fair value of $ 0.93 billion and $ 0.94 billion , respectively, and other short-term borrowings of $ 0.82 billion , in both periods, in our consolidated statement of condition in connection with these trusts. The interest income and interest expense generated by the investments and certificated interests, respectively, are recorded as components of NII when earned or incurred. 

The trusts had a weighted average life of approximately 2.7 years and 3.0 years as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

Interests in Investment Funds 

As of March 31, 2020 , the aggregate assets and liabilities of our consolidated sponsored investment funds totaled $ 16 million and $ 3 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2019 , the aggregate assets and liabilities of our consolidated sponsored investment funds totaled $ 21 million and $ 5 million , respectively. 

As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , our maximum total exposure associated with the consolidated sponsored investment funds totaled $ 13 million and $ 16 million , respectively, and represented the value of our economic ownership interest in the funds. 

We managed certain funds, considered VIEs, in which we held a variable interest but for which we were not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Our potential maximum loss exposure related to these unconsolidated funds totaled $ 20 million as of March 31, 2020 and $ 21 million as of December 31, 2019 , and represented the carrying value of our investments, which are recorded in other assets in our consolidated statement of condition. The amount of loss we may recognize during any period is limited to the carrying amount of our investments in the unconsolidated funds.

Common Stock 

In June 2019, our Board approved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 (the 2019 Program). We repurchased $ 500 million of our common stock in the first quarter of 2020 under the 2019 Program. On March 16, 2020, we announced that we temporarily suspended our common stock repurchase program, together with the other U.S. based GSIFIs, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In June 2018, our Board approved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $ 1.2 billion of our common stock through June 30, 2019 (the 2018 Program). We repurchased $ 300 million of our common stock in the first quarter of 2019 under the 2018 Program.

(1) Other adjustments within CET1 primarily include the overfunded portion of the firm&#8217;s defined benefit pension plan obligation net of associated deferred tax liabilities, disallowed deferred tax assets, and other required credit risk based deductions. 

(2) Includes a CVA which reflects the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of OTC derivative contracts. We used a simple CVA approach in conformity with the Basel III advanced approaches. 

(3) &#160; Under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financial condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes. An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs.

(2) Represents equity-based awards outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted average common shares, because their effect was anti-dilutive. Additional information about equity-based awards is provided on pages 164 and 165 in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

(3) Calculations reflect allocation of earnings to participating securities using the two-class method, as this computation is more dilutive than the treasury stock method.

Contract balances and contract costs 

A s of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , net receivables of $ 2.79 billion and $ 2.77 billion , respectively, are included in accrued interest and fees receivable, representing amounts billed or currently billable related to revenue from contracts with customers. As performance obligations are satisfied, we have an unconditional right to payment and billing is generally performed monthly; therefore, we do not have significant contract assets or liabilities. 

No adjustments are made to the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component as the period between when we transfer a promised service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service is expected to be one year or less. 

Note 20 . Non-U.S. Activities 

We define our non-U.S. activities as those revenue-producing business activities that arise from clients which are generally serviced or managed outside the U.S. Due to the integrated nature of our business, precise segregation of our U.S. and non-U.S. activities is not possible. 

Subjective estimates, assumptions and other judgments are applied to quantify the financial results and assets related to our non-U.S. activities, including our application of funds transfer pricing, our asset and liability management policies and our allocation of certain indirect corporate expenses. Management periodically reviews and updates its processes for quantifying the financial results and assets related to our non-U.S. activities. 

The following table presents our U.S. and non-U.S. financial results for the periods indicated:

Report of Ernst &#38; Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Shareholders and Board of Directors of State Street Corporation 

Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements 

We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated statement of condition of State Street Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) as of March 31, 2020 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related condensed notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;condensed consolidated interim financial statements&#8221;). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles . 

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the consolidated statement of condition of the Corporation as of December 31, 2019 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 20, 2020 , we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated statement of condition as of December 31, 2019, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated statement of condition from which it has been derived. 

Basis for Review Results 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation&#8217;s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

GLOSSARY 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Asset-backed securities: A financial security backed by collateralized assets, other than real estate or mortgage backed securities. Assets under custody and/or administration: Assets that we hold directly or indirectly on behalf of clients under a safekeeping or custody arrangement or for which we provide administrative services for clients. To the extent that we provide more than one AUC/A service (including back and middle office services) for a client&#8217;s assets, the value of the asset is only counted once in the total amount of AUC/A. Assets under management: The total market value of client assets for which we provide investment management strategy services, advisory services and/or distribution services generating management fees based on a percentage of the assets&#8217; market values. These client assets are not included on our balance sheet. Assets under management include managed assets lost but not liquidated. Lost business occurs from time to time and it is difficult to predict the timing of client behavior in transitioning these assets as the timing can vary significantly. 

Beacon: A multi-year program, announced in October 2015, to create cost efficiencies through changes in our operational processes and to further digitize our processes and interfaces with our clients. Certificates of deposit: A savings certificate with a fixed maturity date, specified fixed interest rate and can be issued in any denomination aside from minimum investment requirements. A CD restricts access to the funds until the maturity date of the investment. Collateralized loan obligations: A security backed by a pool of debt, primarily senior secured leveraged loans. CLOs are similar to collateralized mortgage obligations, except for the different type of underlying loan. With a CLO, the investor receives scheduled debt payments from the underlying loans, assuming most of the risk in the event borrowers default, but is offered greater diversity and the potential for higher-than-average returns. Commercial real estate: Property intended to generate profit from capital gains or rental income. CRE loans are term loans secured by commercial and multifamily properties. We seek CRE loans with strong competitive positions in major domestic markets, stable cash flows, modest leverage and experienced institutional ownership. Deposit beta: A measure of how much of an interest rate increase is expected to be passed on to client interest-bearing accounts, on average. Depot bank: A German term, specified by the country's law on investment companies, which essentially corresponds to 'custodian'. Doubtful: Doubtful loans and leases meet the same definition of substandard loans and leases (i.e., well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize repayment with the possibility that we will sustain some loss) with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable. Economic value of equity: A measure designed to estimate the fair value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments based on a discounted cash flow model. Exchange-Traded Fund: A type of exchange-traded investment product that offer investors a way to pool their money in a fund that makes investments in stocks, bonds, or other assets and, in return, to receive an interest in that investment pool. ETF shares are traded on a national stock exchange and at market prices that may or may not be the same as the net asset value. Exposure-at-default: A measure used in the calculation of regulatory capital under Basel III. It can be defined as the expected amount of loss a bank may be exposed to upon default of an obligor. Global systemically important bank: A financial institution whose distress or disorderly failure, because of its size, complexity and systemic interconnectedness, would cause significant disruption to the wider financial system and economic activity, which will be subject to additional capital requirements. Held-to-maturity investment securities: We classify investments in debt securities as held-to-maturity only if we have the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity. Investments in debt securities classified as held-to-maturity are measured subsequently at amortized cost in the statement of financial position. 

High-quality liquid assets: Cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets and are considered unencumbered. Investment grade: A rating of loans and leases to counterparties with strong credit quality and low expected credit risk and probability of default. It applies to counterparties with a strong capacity to support the timely repayment of any financial commitment. Liquidity coverage ratio: The ratio of encumbered high-quality liquid assets divided by expected total net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period. A Basel III framework requirement for banks and bank holding companies to measure liquidity, it is designed to ensure that certain banking institutions, including us, maintain a minimum amount of unencumbered HQLA sufficient to withstand the net cash outflow under a hypothetical standardized acute liquidity stress scenario for a 30-day stress period. Net asset value: The amount of net assets attributable to each share/unit of the fund at a specific date or time. Net stable funding ratio: The ratio of the amount of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding. This ratio should be equal to at least 100% on an ongoing basis. Other-than-temporary-impairment: Impairment charge taken on a security whose fair value has fallen below its carrying value on balance sheet and its value is not expected to recover through the holding period of the security. Probability of default: A measure of the likelihood that a credit obligor will enter into default status. Qualified financial contracts: Securities contracts, commodity contracts, forward contracts, repurchase agreements, swap agreements and any other contract determined by the FDIC to be a qualified financial contract. Risk-weighted assets: A measurement used to quantify risk inherent in our on and off-balance sheet assets by adjusting the asset value for risk. RWA is used in the calculation of our risk-based capital ratios. Special mention: Loans and leases that consist of counterparties with potential weaknesses that, if uncorrected, may result in deterioration of repayment prospects. Speculative: Loans and leases that consist of counterparties that face ongoing uncertainties or exposure to business, financial, or economic downturns. However, these counterparties may have financial flexibility or access to financial alternatives, which allow for financial commitments to be met. Substandard: Loans and leases that consist of counterparties with well-defined weakness that jeopardizes repayment with the possibility we will sustain some loss. Supplementary leverage ratio: The ratio of our tier 1 capital to our total leverage exposure, which measures our capital adequacy relative to our on and off-balance sheet assets. Total loss-absorbing capacity: The sum of our tier 1 regulatory capital plus eligible external long-term debt issued by us. Value-at-Risk: Statistical model used to measure the potential loss in value of a portfolio that could occur in normal markets condition, over a defined holding period, within a certain confidence level. Variable interest entity: An entity that: (1) lacks enough equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties; (2) has equity owners that lack the right to make significant decisions affecting the entity&#8217;s operations; and/or (3) has equity owners that do not have an obligation to absorb or the right to receive the entity&#8217;s losses or return.
