FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;goals,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;initiatives,&#8221; &#8220;potentially,&#8221; &#8220;probably,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;outlook,&#8221; &#8220;guidance&#8221; or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; and &#8220;could.&#8221; 

Forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management, and on information currently available to management. Our statements speak as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update these statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements in light of new information or future events. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation: 

&#8226; Negative economic, business and political conditions, including as a result of the interest rate environment, supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and labor shortages, that adversely affect the general economy, housing prices, the job market, consumer confidence and spending habits; 

&#8226; The general state of the economy and employment, as well as general business and economic conditions, and changes in the competitive environment; 

&#8226; Our capital and liquidity requirements under regulatory standards and our ability to generate capital and liquidity on favorable terms; 

&#8226; The effect of changes in our credit ratings on our cost of funding, access to capital markets, ability to market our securities, and overall liquidity position; 

&#8226; The effect of changes in the level of commercial and consumer deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin; 

&#8226; Our ability to execute on our strategic business initiatives and achieve our financial performance goals across our Consumer and Commercial businesses, including our Private Bank; 

&#8226; The effects of geopolitical instability, including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, on economic and market conditions, inflationary pressures and the interest rate environment, commodity price and foreign exchange rate volatility, and heightened cybersecurity risks; 

&#8226; Our ability to comply with heightened supervisory requirements and expectations as well as new or amended regulations; 

&#8226; Liabilities and business restrictions resulting from litigation and regulatory investigations; 

&#8226; The effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale; 

&#8226; Changes in interest rates and market liquidity, as well as the magnitude of such changes, which may reduce interest margins, impact funding sources and affect the ability to originate and distribute financial products in the primary and secondary markets; 

&#8226; Financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses; 

&#8226; Environmental risks, such as physical or transition risks associated with climate change, and social and governance risks, that could adversely affect our reputation, operations, business, and customers; 

&#8226; A failure in or breach of our compliance with laws, as well as operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks; and 

&#8226; Management&#8217;s ability to identify and manage these and other risks. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 6 

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the actual amounts and timing of any future common stock dividends or share repurchases will be subject to various factors, including our capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions, and regulatory considerations, as well as any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant in making such a determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares from or pay any dividends to holders of our common stock, or as to the amount of any such repurchases or dividends. 

More information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K.

The following MD&#38;A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements and supplemental financial information.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This document contains non-GAAP financial measures denoted as &#8220;Underlying&#8221; results and &#8220;including AOCI impact.&#8221; Underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that period which management does not consider indicative of our on-going financial performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe our Underlying results in any given reporting period reflect our on-going financial performance in that period and, accordingly, are useful to consider in addition to our GAAP financial results. We further believe the presentation of Underlying results increases comparability of period-to-period results. 

Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP financial measures, but to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP. 

Non-GAAP measures are denoted throughout our MD&#38;A by the use of the term &#8220;Underlying.&#8221; Where there is a reference to these metrics in that paragraph, all measures that follow are on the same basis when applicable. For more information on the computation of non-GAAP financial measures, see &#8220;Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations.&#8221;

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets (generally loans and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (generally deposits and borrowed funds). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on our average interest-earning assets and the effective cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. These factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FRB and market interest rates. For further discussion, refer to the &#8220;Market Risk&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Governance&#8221; sections of our 2023 Form 10-K.

(1) Net interest income and net interest margin is presented on a FTE basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21%. The FTE impact is predominantly attributable to commercial and industrial loans for the periods presented. 

Net interest income decreased $178 million, or 11%, and decreased $379 million, or 12%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, reflecting lower net interest margin and a decline of 2% and 1%, respectively, in average interest-earning assets. 

Net interest margin on a FTE basis decreased 30 basis points and 34 basis points for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, reflecting higher funding and swap costs and the impact of building liquidity, partially offset by higher interest-earning-asset yields and the benefit of Non-Core portfolio runoff. 

Average interest-earning assets decreased $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by a decline in total loans and leases, partially offset by an increase in investment securities and cash held in interest-bearing deposits. 

Average deposits increased $421 million and $1.1 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven primarily by growth in Private Bank deposits, partially offset by a decline in treasury and commercial deposits reflecting deposit optimization initiatives. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 11 

Average total borrowed funds decreased $2.8 billion and $3.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, reflecting a decline in FHLB advances driven by Non-Core portfolio runoff, partially offset by a remix of funding to long-term senior debt and secured borrowings collateralized by auto loans.

The primary drivers for the changes in noninterest income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, are highlighted below. 

&#8226; Capital markets fees increased given higher bond and equity underwriting, loan syndication, and M&#38;A advisory fees. 

&#8226; Card fees increased primarily reflecting higher credit card fees, including favorable vendor contract negotiations. 

&#8226; Wealth fees reflect increased sales activity and asset management fees given a constructive market environment and contribution from the Private Bank. 

&#8226; Foreign exchange and derivative products revenue decreased given reduced client activity related to interest rate and commodities hedging. 

&#8226; Mortgage banking fees declined reflecting lower production fees, partially offset by a higher MSR valuation, net of hedge impact. Lower servicing fees are also a driver during the six-month period. 

&#8226; Other income decreased driven primarily by higher operational losses.

Noninterest Expense 

Table 4: Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Change Percent 2024 2023 Change Percent Salaries and employee benefits $645 $615 $30 5 % $1,336 $1,273 $63 5 % Equipment and software 190 181 9 5 382 350 32 9 Outside services 165 177 (12) (7) 323 353 (30) (8) Occupancy 113 136 (23) (17) 227 260 (33) (13) Other operating expense 188 197 (9) (5) 391 366 25 7 Noninterest expense $1,301 $1,306 ($5) &#8212; % $2,659 $2,602 $57 2 % 

The increase in noninterest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was driven by salaries and employee benefits reflecting our Private Bank start-up investment, equipment and software given technology investments and maintenance, and other operating expense largely associated with FDIC deposit insurance, reflecting an estimate of CBNA&#8217;s incremental special assessment of $40 million recognized in 2024. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising and travel-related expenses. Noninterest expense was stable for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 

For more information regarding CBNA&#8217;s special assessment, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision - Deposit Insurance&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate our ACL. The total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded commitments. Refer to &#8220;Analysis of Financial Condition &#8212; Credit Quality&#8221; for more information. 

Provision expense of $182 million and $353 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $176 million and $344 million for the same periods in 2023. The provision expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 reflects higher reserves against the CRE office portfolio primarily driven by elevated interest rates and return-to-office dynamics. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense of $88 million and $184 million decreased $46 million and $103 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The effective income tax rate of 18.5% and 20.3% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 decreased from 22.1% and 22.5%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. These decreases were driven by lower pre-tax income, the favorable impact of certain tax matters and additional benefits from tax-advantaged investments. Provision for income taxes is calculated by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date pre-tax income, adjusting for discrete items that occurred during the period. 

Business Operating Segments 

We have three business operating segments: Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, and Non-Core. See Note 1 for a description of segment changes made during the third quarter of 2023 and Note 16 for more information regarding our business operating segments.

Consumer Banking 

Net interest income increased $97 million and $179 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by higher net interest margin reflecting higher interest-earning asset yields and growth in average interest-earning assets. These increases were partially offset by higher funding costs. 

Noninterest income increased $9 million and $11 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by wealth fees reflecting increased sales activity and asset management fees, higher credit card fees, and service charges and fees given higher overdraft and cash management fees. These increases were partially offset by mortgage banking fees reflecting lower production fees, partially offset by a higher MSR valuation, net of hedge impact, and other income driven primarily by higher operational losses. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 14 

Noninterest expense increased $40 million and $86 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven primarily by salaries and benefits reflecting our Private Bank start-up investment. 

Net charge-offs increased $16 million and $34 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven primarily by other retail and education. 

Commercial Banking 

Net interest income decreased $90 million and $173 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by lower net interest margin, a decline in average interest-earning assets and higher funding costs. 

Noninterest income increased $35 million and $61 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by capital markets fees reflecting higher bond and equity underwriting, loan syndication, and M&#38;A advisory fees. These increases were partially offset by foreign exchange and derivative products revenue given reduced client activity related to interest rate and commodities hedging. 

Noninterest expense decreased $4 million and $18 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven primarily by salaries and employee benefits reflecting lower headcount. 

Net charge-offs increased $19 million and $53 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by the office segment of CRE. 

Non-Core 

Net interest income decreased $3 million and $25 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by the highest-cost implied marginal funding sources during 2024, including secured borrowings collateralized by auto loans and FHLB advances, and a decline in average interest-earning assets. 

Average loans and leases decreased $5.0 billion and $5.1 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by planned Non-Core portfolio runoff.

The primary objective of the securities portfolio is to provide a readily available source of liquidity. The portfolio primarily includes high-quality, highly liquid investments reflecting our ongoing commitment to maintain strong contingent liquidity levels and pledging capacity. 

As of June 30, 2024, U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities issued by GNMA and GSEs represented 98% of the fair value of our debt securities portfolio, with approximately $32.1 billion of unencumbered high-quality liquid securities serving as potential collateral for borrowings from the FHLB, FRB discount window, and the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation bilateral repurchase agreement market. 

For further discussion of the use of our securities as liquidity collateral see the &#8220;Liquidity Risk Management and Governance&#8221; section in this document. For further discussion of liquidity requirements, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision &#8212; Liquidity Requirements&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

We manage our securities portfolio duration and convexity risk through asset selection and securities structure, and maintain duration levels within our risk appetite in the context of the broader interest rate risk framework and limits. As of June 30, 2024, the portfolio&#8217;s average effective duration, including recent hedging actions to reduce duration, was 3.7 years compared with 3.9 years as of December 31, 2023.

The decrease in total loans and leases as of June 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 reflects a $2.5 billion decrease in commercial given balance sheet optimization actions, paydowns and market conditions driving lower client demand. Retail decreased $1.6 billion, primarily driven by planned Non-Core portfolio runoff, partially offset by growth in home equity and mortgage. 

Credit Quality 

See Note 1 for a description of changes made to the Company&#8217;s loans and leases presentation during the first quarter of 2024.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, net charge-offs increased $32 million and increased $80 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The net charge-off ratio increased 12 basis points and 14 basis points, respectively, compared to the same periods. 

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the increase in retail net charge-offs was primarily driven by unsecured and education loans, partially offset by a decline in auto, while the increase in commercial was primarily driven by the office segment of CRE, partially offset by a decline in commercial and industrial.

Commercial Loan Asset Quality 

Our commercial portfolio consists of traditional commercial and industrial loans, commercial leases, and commercial real estate loans. As discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K, we utilize internal risk ratings to monitor credit quality for commercial loans and leases. 

Total commercial criticized balances of $8.4 billion at June 30, 2024 decreased $92 million compared to December 31, 2023. 

Commercial and industrial criticized balances of $3.0 billion at June 30, 2024 decreased from $3.5 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily driven by declines in the healthcare and wholesale trade sectors. 

Commercial real estate criticized balances of $5.4 billion at June 30, 2024 increased from $5.0 billion at December 31, 2023, attributable to the continued impacts of interest rates and return-to-office dynamics on the Office sector and the continued impacts of interest rates on the Multi-family sector. Approximately 97% of commercial real estate loans remain current on payments as of June 30, 2024. 

For more information on the distribution of commercial loans by vintage date and regulatory classification rating, see Note 4.

Retail Loan Asset Quality 

We utilize credit scores provided by FICO, which are generally refreshed on a quarterly basis, and payment and delinquency status, among other data points, to monitor credit quality for retail loans. FICO credit scores represent current and historical national industry-wide consumer level credit performance data, which management believes are the strongest indicator of potential credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and a good predictor of a borrower&#8217;s future payment performance.

Borrowed Funds 

Total borrowed funds of $13.1 billion as of June 30, 2024 decreased $888 million compared to December 31, 2023, driven by a decline of approximately $3.7 billion in FHLB advances, partially offset by the issuance of senior debt and secured borrowings collateralized by auto loans. For more information regarding our borrowed funds, see &#8220;Liquidity&#8221; and Note 7. 

CAPITAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS 

As a bank and financial holding company, we are subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB. Our banking subsidiary, CBNA, is a national banking association primarily regulated by the OCC. Our regulation and supervision continues to evolve as the legal and regulatory frameworks governing our operations continue to change. See &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K for more information. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 21 

Capital Adequacy Process 

Our assessment of capital adequacy begins with our Board-approved risk appetite and risk management framework. This framework provides for the identification, measurement and management of material risks. There have been no significant changes to our capital adequacy risk appetite and risk management framework as described in &#8220;Capital and Regulatory Matters&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

The FRB regularly supervises and evaluates our capital adequacy and capital planning processes, including the submission of an annual capital plan approved by our Board of Directors or one of its committees. Under the FRB&#8217;s capital requirements, we must maintain capital ratios above the sum of the regulatory minimum and SCB requirement to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The FRB utilizes the supervisory stress test to determine our SCB, which is re-calibrated with each biennial supervisory stress test and updated annually to reflect our planned common stock dividends. As an institution subject to Category IV standards, we are subject to biennial supervisory stress testing in even-numbered years; however, the FRB required us to participate in the 2023 CCAR supervisory stress test to incorporate the effects of the Investors acquisition. Our SCB associated with the 2023 CCAR supervisory stress test is 4.0%, effective until September 30, 2024. We submitted our 2024 Capital Plan to the FRB on April 3, 2024, and on June 28, 2024, the FRB communicated to the Company its preliminary SCB of 4.5% associated with the 2024 CCAR supervisory stress test, effective October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. 

Regulations relating to capital planning, regulatory reporting, stress testing and capital buffer requirements applicable to firms like us are presently subject to rule-making and potential further guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. We will continue to evaluate the impact of these and any other prudential regulatory changes, including their potential resultant changes in our regulatory and compliance costs and expenses. 

For more information on our capital adequacy process, see &#8220;Capital and Regulatory Matters&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Regulatory Capital Ratios and Capital Composition 

Under the current U.S. Basel III capital framework, we and our banking subsidiary, CBNA, must meet the following specific minimum requirements: CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, total capital ratio of 8.0% and tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. As a bank holding company, our SCB of 4.0% is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above and a CCB of 2.5% is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above for CBNA. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 22 

For additional discussion of the U.S. Basel III capital framework and its related application, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. The table below presents the regulatory capital ratios for CFG and CBNA under the U.S. Basel III Standardized rules:

(2) Represents total average assets less certain amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital. 

At June 30, 2024, CFG&#8217;s CET1 and tier 1 capital ratios increased compared to December 31, 2023. Net income and a $4.2 billion decrease in RWA was partially offset by common share repurchases, dividends, and a decrease in the modified CECL transition amount as we entered the third year of the CECL three-year transition period. Lower auto and commercial loans were the key drivers for the decline in RWA. An increase in preferred stock was also a contributing factor to the tier 1 capital ratio increase. 

At June 30, 2024, CBNA&#8217;s CET1 and tier 1 capital ratios increased compared to December 31, 2023. Net income and a $4.4 billion decrease in RWA, primarily driven by lower auto and commercial loans, was partially offset by dividend payments to the Parent Company and a decrease in the modified CECL transition amount as we entered the third year of the CECL three-year transition period. 

At June 30, 2024, CFG&#8217;s and CBNA&#8217;s total capital ratios increased compared to December 31, 2023, driven by their respective changes in CET1 and tier 1 capital described above and a reduction in the modified AACL transition amount. 

At June 30, 2024, CFG&#8217;s and CBNA&#8217;s tier 1 leverage ratios increased compared to December 31, 2023, reflecting a decline in quarterly adjusted average assets and their respective changes in tier 1 capital described above.

Capital Transactions 

We completed the following capital transactions during the six months ended June 30, 2024: 

&#8226; Repurchased $500 million of our outstanding common stock; 

&#8226; Issued 400,000 shares of 7.375% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual Series H Preferred Stock at an aggregate offering price of $400 million, with net proceeds utilized to redeem the floating rate non-cumulative perpetual Series D Preferred Stock and for general corporate purposes; 

&#8226; Issued a notice to redeem all outstanding shares of the 9.205% floating rate non-cumulative perpetual Series D Preferred Stock, which was redeemed on July 8, 2024; 

&#8226; Declared quarterly common stock dividends of $0.42 per share, aggregating to $391 million; and 

&#8226; Declared preferred stock dividends aggregating to $65 million. 

For additional detail regarding our common and preferred stock dividends see Note 10. 

On June 28, 2024, our Board of Directors increased the capacity of our common share repurchase program to $1.25 billion, an increase of $656 million above the $594 million of capacity remaining under the prior February 2023 authorization. All future capital distributions are subject to consideration and approval by our Board of Directors prior to execution. The timing and amount of future dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors, including our capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions, and regulatory considerations. 

AOCI Impact on Regulatory Capital 

Under the current applicable regulatory capital rules we have made the AOCI opt-out election, which enables us to exclude components of AOCI from regulatory capital. As noted in the &#8220;Capital and Stress Testing Requirements&#8221; section of &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K, the regulatory agencies are considering the inclusion of AOCI components in regulatory capital for Category IV firms like us, notably the AOCI relative to securities and pension. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 24 

The following table presents our regulatory capital ratios including the AOCI impact from securities and pension, which we believe provides useful information in light of recent events and the potential for change in the regulatory capital framework.

Recent Regulatory Developments 

On March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted a final rule to require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. Subsequent to adoption, a number of businesses and business groups filed petitions seeking a judicial review of the final rule, asserting that the SEC does not have the authority to promulgate it. On April 4, 2024, the SEC issued an order staying its final rule pending completion of the judicial review of certain petitions consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. We will continue to monitor the outcome of this judicial review. 

LIQUIDITY 

We consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity fundamental to our safety and soundness. We define liquidity as our ability to meet our obligations when they come due. As a financial institution, we must maintain operating liquidity to meet expected daily and forecasted cash-flow requirements, as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected (stress scenario) funding requirements. Reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stress-scenario funding requirements, we identify and manage contingent liquidity, consisting of cash balances at the FRB, unencumbered high-quality liquid securities and unused FHLB borrowing capacity. Separately, we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of contingent liquidity, consisting of cash balances at the FRB and unencumbered high-quality liquid securities. We maintain additional secured borrowing capacity at the FRB discount window, but do not view this as a primary means of funding, but rather a potential source in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. We manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity. 

Parent Company Liquidity 

Our Parent Company&#8217;s primary sources of cash are dividends and interest received from CBNA resulting from investing in bank equity and subordinated debt as well as externally issued preferred stock, senior debt and subordinated debt. Uses of cash include the routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company, including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends, interest and expenses; the needs of subsidiaries, including CBNA for additional equity and, as required, its need for debt financing; and the support for extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. To the extent the Parent Company relies on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 25 

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Parent Company completed the following transactions: 

&#8226; Issued $1.25 billion of 5.841% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2030; 

&#8226; Issued $750 million of 6.645% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2035; 

&#8226; Issued 400,000 shares of 7.375% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual Series H Preferred Stock at an aggregate offering price of $400 million, with net proceeds utilized to redeem the floating rate non-cumulative perpetual Series D Preferred Stock and for general corporate purposes; and 

&#8226; Issued a notice to redeem all outstanding shares of the 9.205% floating rate non-cumulative perpetual Series D Preferred Stock, which was redeemed on July 8, 2024. 

Our Parent Company&#8217;s cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs and totaled $3.2 billion and $2.9 billion as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

During the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Parent Company declared dividends on common stock of $194 million and $205 million, respectively, and declared dividends on preferred stock of $35 million and $34 million, respectively. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Parent Company declared dividends on common stock of $391 million and $410 million, respectively, and declared dividends on preferred stock of $65 million and $57 million, respectively. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Parent Company repurchased $500 million of its outstanding common stock. 

CBNA Liquidity 

As CBNA&#8217;s primary business involves taking deposits and making loans, a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds. Liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings, pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. In the ordinary course of business, the liquidity of CBNA is managed by matching sources and uses of cash. The primary sources of bank liquidity include deposits from our consumer and commercial customers; payments of principal and interest on loans and investment securities; and wholesale borrowings, as needed, and as described under &#8220;Liquidity Risk Management and Governance.&#8221; The primary uses of bank liquidity include withdrawals and maturities of deposits; payment of interest on deposits; funding of loans and related commitments; and funding of securities purchases. To the extent that CBNA relies on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest. For further information on CBNA&#8217;s outstanding debt see Note 7. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, CBNA completed the following transactions: 

&#8226; Issued $2.6 billion of secured borrowings collateralized by auto loans; and 

&#8226; Redeemed $650 million of 4.119% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2025. 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk is the risk arising from the inability to meet our obligations when they come due. We must maintain adequate funding to meet current and future obligations, including customer loan requests, deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service requirements, equipment and premises leases, and other cash commitments, under both normal operating conditions and periods of company-specific and/or market stress. 

We primarily rely on customer deposits to be a relatively stable and low-cost source of funding. In addition to customer deposits, our funding sources also include our ability to securitize loans in secondary markets, raise funds in the debt and equity capital markets, pledge loans and/or securities for borrowing from the FHLB, pledge securities as collateral for borrowing under repurchase agreements, and sell AFS securities. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 26 

Credit ratings assigned by agencies such as Moody&#8217;s, Standard and Poor&#8217;s, and Fitch impact our access to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large uninsured customer deposits and are presented in the table below.

We currently have a &#8220;stable&#8221; outlook at Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s, a &#8220;negative&#8221; outlook at Moody&#8217;s and a &#8220;stable&#8221; outlook at Fitch. Changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding. 

Existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices. The FRB and OCC regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process. In addition, we are subject to existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements, some of which are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. For further discussion, see the &#8220;Liquidity Requirements&#8221; section under &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Liquidity Risk Management and Governance 

Liquidity risk is measured and managed by the Funding and Liquidity unit within our Treasury group in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our Board and the Asset Liability Committee. The Funding and Liquidity unit is responsible for maintaining a liquidity management framework that effectively manages liquidity risk. Processes within this framework include, but are not limited to, regular and comprehensive reporting, including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators, explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and, as appropriate, recommended remedial strategies, liquidity stress testing, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. 

Our Funding and Liquidity unit&#8217;s primary goals are to deliver and maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements, contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic, systemic, and combination stress events, and regulatory liquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and cost-efficient funding sources. We seek to accomplish these goals by funding loans with stable deposits, by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding, particularly short-term unsecured funding, and by maintaining ample available liquidity, including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered high-quality loans and securities. 

We maintain a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. The plan identifies members of the liquidity contingency team and provides a framework for management to follow, including notification and escalation of potential liquidity stress events. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 27 

As of June 30, 2024: 

&#8226; Organically generated deposits continue to be our primary source of funding, resulting in a consolidated period-end loans-to-deposits ratio, excluding LHFS, of 80.4%; 

&#9702; Estimated insured/secured deposits comprise 70% of our consolidated deposit base of $176.4 billion. 

&#8226; Our total available liquidity, comprised of contingent liquidity and available discount window capacity, was approximately $80.4 billion; 

&#9702; Contingent liquidity was $62.4 billion, consisting of unencumbered high-quality liquid securities of $32.1 billion, unused FHLB capacity of $19.8 billion, and our cash balances at the FRB of $10.5 billion; and 

&#9702; Available discount window capacity was $18.0 billion, defined as available total borrowing capacity from the FRB based on identified collateral, which is primarily secured by non-mortgage commercial and retail loans. 

For a summary of our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 1. 

The Funding and Liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics, including specific risk thresholds limits. These monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows: 

&#8226; Current liquidity sources and capacities, including cash balances at the FRB, free and liquid securities, and secured borrowing capacity at the FHLB and FRB discount window; 

&#8226; Liquidity stress sources, including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined stresses, in addition to evolving regulatory requirements; and 

&#8226; Current and prospective exposures, including secured and unsecured wholesale funding, and spot and cumulative cash-flow gaps across a variety of horizons. 

Further, certain of these metrics are monitored individually for CBNA and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis, including cash position, unencumbered securities, asset liquidity and available FHLB borrowing capacity. In order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions, specific metrics are also forecasted over a one-year horizon. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We engage in a variety of activities that are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that are generally referred to as &#8220;off-balance sheet arrangements.&#8221; For more information on these types of activities, see Note 11. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

An accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time. Changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. Our significant accounting policies and estimates include the ACL, fair value measurements and the evaluation and measurement of goodwill impairment. For additional information regarding fair value measurements, see &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL of $2.3 billion at June 30, 2024 remained stable compared to December 31, 2023. 

As of June 30, 2024, the ACL economic forecast over a two-year reasonable and supportable period was consistent with December 31, 2023, with peak unemployment of approximately 5.0% and start-to-trough real GDP decline of approximately 0.4%. These forecasts reflect a mild recession over the two-year reasonable and supportable period. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 28 

Our determination of the ACL is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the reasonable and supportable forecast period. To illustrate the sensitivity, we applied a more pessimistic scenario than that described above which reflects deeper real GDP contraction across our two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period with peak unemployment of approximately 5.8% and start-to-trough real GDP decline of approximately 1.9%. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately 1.2x our modeled period-end ACL, or an increase of approximately $392 million. This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimate and not to the overall period-end ACL, which includes qualitative adjustments. 

Because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the ACL, this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ACL or even what the ACL would be under these economic circumstances. The sensitivity analysis is intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss estimates. The hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the ACL and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loss rates. 

It remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our ACL because such forecasts consider a wide variety of variables and inputs, and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur at the same time or in the same direction, and such changes may have differing impacts by product type. The variables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by risks to the economy, including changing monetary and fiscal policies, impacts from the recent stress on the banking industry, and their impact on inflationary trends. Changes in one or multiple of the key macroeconomic variables may have a material impact on our estimation of expected credit losses.

Goodwill 

We review the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of October 31 st or more frequently if events or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, a qualitative assessment may be made to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. The process of evaluating the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective, involving management assumptions, estimates and forecasts, and the use of external or internal valuations. Future potential changes in assumptions, estimates or forecasts may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. Additionally, a reporting unit&#8217;s fair value could change based on market conditions or other factors, which could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.

RISK GOVERNANCE 

We are committed to maintaining a strong, integrated and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives. A key aspect of our Board&#8217;s responsibility as the main decision-making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood. 

To enable our Board to carry out its objectives, it has delegated authority for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, to a number of Board and executive management level risk committees. The Executive Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for oversight of risk across the enterprise and actively considers our inherent material risks, analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified, assessed and mitigated. Reporting to the Executive Risk Committee are the following committees covering specific areas of risk: Compliance and Operational Risk, Model Risk, Credit Policy, Asset Liability, Business Initiatives Review, and Conduct and Ethics. 

There have been no significant changes in our risk governance practices, risk framework, risk appetite, or credit risk as described in &#8220;Risk Governance&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

MARKET RISK 

Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. Modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including the hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk. As described below, the market risk arising from our non-trading banking activities, such as the origination of loans and deposit-gathering, is more significant. We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. We actively manage market risk for both non-trading and trading activities. 

Non-Trading Risk 

Our non-trading banking activities expose us to market risk. This market risk is composed of interest rate risk, as we have no commodity risk and de minimis direct currency and equity risk. We also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations, as well as the valuation of our MSRs. There have been no significant changes in our sources of interest rate risk, interest rate risk practices, risk framework, metrics or assumptions as described in &#8220;Market Risk &#8212; Non-Trading Risk&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

The table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve. Our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve. As the following table illustrates, our balance sheet is marginally asset-sensitive; net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates, while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limits established and monitored by senior management. While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is included in this analysis, we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would be more gradual and, therefore, have a more modest impact. 

Table 21: Sensitivity of Net Interest Income Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income over 12 Months Basis points June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Instantaneous Change in Interest Rates &#160; &#160; +200 0.3 % &#8212; % +100 0.5 0.5 -100 (1.1) (1.5) -200 (2.8) (3.0) Gradual Change in Interest Rates +200 1.1 % 0.4 % +100 0.6 0.5 -100 (0.8) (1.0) -200 (1.7) (1.9) 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 31 

We continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy, changing market conditions and changes in our balance sheet. The Company&#8217;s base case net interest income assumes the forward-rate path implied by the period-end yield curve is realized. The rate risk exposure is then measured based on assumed changes from that base case rate path. 

Our asset sensitivity remains broadly neutral as of June 30, 2024, consistent with December 31, 2023. This incorporates the impacts of changes in our balance sheet mix, including securities, loans, deposits, borrowed funds and hedge activity, which is primarily comprised of received fixed swaps that offset our naturally asset-sensitive balance sheet. Our sensitivity profile exhibits asymmetry for up and down rate scenarios as we expect to see incremental deposit migration to higher rate products in response to rising rate scenarios compared to declining rate scenarios. 

We use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk, EVE, as a supplement to net interest income simulations. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a long-term horizon. EVE measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. We employ sophisticated models for prepayments and deposit pricing and attrition, which provide a granular view of cash flows based on the unique characteristics of the underlying products and customer segments. The change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital. 

We use interest rate contracts as part of our ALM strategy to manage exposure to the variability in the interest cash flows on our floating-rate assets and wholesale funding, the variability in the fair value of AFS securities, and to hedge market risk on fixed-rate capital markets debt issuances.

(2) Weighted average floor rate represents strike rates for the short and long interest rate floors, respectively. CFG will receive interest if the SOFR rate falls below the upper strike rate and pay interest if the SOFR rate falls below the lower strike rate, effectively hedging the corridor between the two strike rates. The structure also includes a short cap and a long floor which are utilized to neutralize the initial premium.

Using the interest rate curve at June 30, 2024, we estimate that approximately $984 million in pre-tax net losses related to cash flow hedge strategies will be reclassified from AOCI to net interest income over the next 12 months, including $448 million from terminated swaps. This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations and the addition of other hedges subsequent to June 30, 2024. 

Capital Markets 

A key component of our capital markets activities is the underwriting and distribution of corporate credit facilities to finance merger and acquisition transactions for our clients. We have a rigorous risk management process around these activities, including a limit structure capping our underwriting risk, potential loss, and sub-limits for specific asset classes. Further, the ability to approve underwriting exposure is delegated only to senior level individuals in the credit risk management and capital markets organizations with each transaction adjudicated in the Loan Underwriting Approval Committee. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights &#160; 

We have market risk associated with the value of residential MSRs, which are impacted by various types of inherent risks, including duration, basis, convexity, volatility and yield curve. 

As part of our overall risk management strategy we enter into various free-standing derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate futures and forward contracts to purchase mortgage-backed securities to economically hedge the changes in fair value of our MSRs. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of our MSRs was $1.6 billion, and the total notional amount of related derivative contracts was $11.4 billion and $15.1 billion, respectively. Gains and losses on MSRs and the related derivatives used for hedging are included in mortgage banking fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

As with our traded market risk-based activities, earnings at risk excludes the impact of MSRs. MSRs are captured under our single price risk management framework that is used for calculating a management value at risk consistent with the definition used by banking regulators. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 34 

Trading Risk 

We are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities from certain derivative and foreign exchange products as well as underwriting and market making activities. Market risk exposure arises from fluctuations in interest rates, basis spreads, volatility, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads across various financial instruments. Securities underwriting and trading activities are conducted through CBNA and Citizens JMP Securities, LLC. There have been no significant changes in our market risk governance, market risk measurement, or market risk practices including VaR, stressed VaR, sensitivity analysis, stress testing, or VaR model review and validation as described in &#8220;Market Risk &#8212; Trading Risk&#8221; in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Market Risk Regulatory Capital 

The U.S. banking regulators&#8217; &#8220;Market Risk Rule&#8221; covers the calculation of market risk capital. Under this rule, all of our client facing trades and associated hedges maintain a net low risk and qualify as &#8220;covered positions.&#8221; The internal management VaR measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory VaR.

VaR Backtesting 

Backtesting is one form of validation of the VaR model and is run daily. The Market Risk Rule requires a comparison of our internal VaR measure to the actual net trading revenue (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, intra-day trading and net interest income) for each day over the preceding year (the most recent 250 business days). Any observed loss in excess of the VaR number is taken as an exception. The level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the VaR and SVaR-based capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes, when applicable. We perform sub-portfolio backtesting as required under the Market Risk Rule, using models approved by our banking regulators for interest rate, credit spread and foreign exchange positions. 

The following graph shows our daily net trading revenue and total internal, modeled VaR for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include all information and notes included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the interim period results presented. These unaudited interim financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in the Company&#8217;s 2023 Form 10-K. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. 

The unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Citizens and its subsidiaries, including VIEs in which Citizens is a primary beneficiary. Investments in VIEs in which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are not consolidated. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

During the third quarter of 2023, the Company&#8217;s indirect auto and certain purchased consumer loan portfolios were transferred from the Consumer Banking segment into a new Non-Core segment to reflect the manner in which management is currently assessing performance and allocating resources. Prior period results have been revised to conform to the new segment presentation. See Note 16 for additional information. 

During the first quarter of 2024, the Company modified the presentation of its loans and leases portfolio to include leases in the commercial and industrial financing receivable class. Prior period results have been revised to conform to the new presentation. See Notes 3 and 4 for additional information relative to the Company&#8217;s loans and leases portfolio. 

Effective for the second quarter of 2024, Trust and investment services fees was renamed to Wealth fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to better reflect the broad range of wealth-related management fees and services provided to customers. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the ACL, fair value measurements and the evaluation and measurement of goodwill impairment. 

Significant Accounting Policies 

For further information regarding the Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies, see Note 1 in the Company&#8217;s 2023 Form 10-K.

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 48 

The Company enters into security repurchase agreements with unrelated counterparties, which involve the transfer of a security from one party to another, and a subsequent transfer of substantially the same security back to the original party. These repurchase agreements are typically short-term in nature and are accounted for as secured borrowed funds in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognized no offsetting short-term receivables or payables associated with security repurchase agreements as of June 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 

Securitizations of mortgage loans retained in the investment portfolio were $ 133 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. There were no securitizations of mortgage loans retained in the investment portfolio for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. 

Impairment 

The Company evaluated its existing HTM portfolio as of June 30, 2024 and concluded that 95 % of HTM securities met the zero expected credit loss criteria and, therefore, no ACL was recognized. Lifetime expected credit losses on the remainder of the HTM portfolio were determined to be insignificant based on the modeling of the Company&#8217;s credit loss position in the securities. The Company monitors the credit exposure through the use of credit quality indicators. For these securities, the Company uses external credit ratings or an internally derived credit rating when an external rating is not available. All securities were determined to be investment grade at June 30, 2024. 

The following tables present AFS debt securities with fair values below their respective carrying values, separated by the duration the securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position:

Citizens does not currently have the intent to sell these debt securities, and it is not more-likely-than-not that the Company will be required to sell these debt securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost bases. Citizens has determined that credit losses are not expected to be incurred on the AFS debt securities identified with unrealized losses as of June 30, 2024. The unrealized losses on these debt securities reflect non-credit-related factors driven by changes in interest rates. Therefore, the Company has determined that these debt securities are not impaired.

NOTE 4 - CREDIT QUALITY AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

Allowance for Credit Losses &#160; 

The Company&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses in its loan and lease portfolios is recorded in the ACL and considers extensive historical loss experience, including the impact of loss mitigation and restructuring programs that the Company offers to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, as well as projected loss severity as a result of loan default. 

For a detailed discussion of the ACL reserve methodology and estimation techniques as of December 31, 2023, see Note 6 in the Company&#8217;s 2023 Form 10-K. There were no significant changes to the ACL reserve methodology during the six months ended June 30, 2024.

For retail loans, Citizens utilizes FICO credit scores and the loan&#8217;s payment and delinquency status to monitor credit quality. Management believes FICO scores are the strongest indicator of credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and assist management in predicting the borrower&#8217;s future payment performance. Scores are based on current and historical national industry-wide consumer level credit performance data.

Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 

The Company offers loan modifications, characterized as FDMs, to retail and commercial borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as a result of its loss mitigation activities that may result in a payment delay, interest rate reduction, term extension, principal forgiveness, or combination thereof. Payment delays consist of modifications that result in a delay of contractual amounts due greater than three months over a rolling 12-month period. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 56 

Commercial loan modifications are offered on a case-by-case basis and generally include a payment delay, term extension and/or interest rate reduction. The Company does not typically offer principal forgiveness for commercial loans. Retail loan modifications are offered through structured loan modification programs, which are summarized below. 

&#8226; Forbearance programs provide borrowers experiencing some form of hardship a period of time during which their contractual payment obligations are suspended, resulting in a payment delay and/or term extension. 

&#8226; Other repayment plans are offered due to hardship and include an interest rate reduction and/or term extension designed to enable the borrower to return the loan to current status in an expeditious manner. 

&#8226; Settlement agreements may be executed with borrowers experiencing a long-term hardship or who are delinquent, resulting in principal forgiveness. Upon fulfillment of the terms of the settlement agreement, the unpaid principal amount is forgiven resulting in a charge-off of the outstanding principal balance. 

&#8226; Certain reorganization bankruptcy judgments may result in any one of the four modification types or some combination thereof. 

The following tables present the period-end amortized cost of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were modified during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, disaggregated by class of financing receivable and modification type. The modification type reflects the cumulative effect of all FDMs received during the indicated period.

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

The Company&#8217;s lending activity is geographically well diversified with an emphasis in our core markets located in the New England, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. Generally, loans are collateralized by assets including real estate, inventory, accounts receivable, other personal property and investment securities. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no material concentration risks within the commercial or retail loan portfolios. Exposure to credit losses arising from lending transactions may fluctuate with fair values of collateral supporting loans, which may not perform according to contractual agreements. The Company&#8217;s policy is to collateralize loans to the extent necessary; however, unsecured loans are also granted on the basis of the financial strength of the applicant and the facts surrounding the transaction. 

NOTE 5 - MORTGAGE BANKING AND OTHER SERVICED LOANS 

The Company sells residential mortgages into the secondary market and retains no beneficial interest in these sales, but may retain the servicing rights for the loans sold. The Company may exercise its option to repurchase eligible government guaranteed residential mortgages or may be obligated to subsequently repurchase a loan if the purchaser discovers a representation or warranty violation such as noncompliance with eligibility or servicing requirements, or customer fraud that should have been identified in a loan file review. 

The following table summarizes activity related to residential mortgage loans sold with servicing rights retained:

The unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans related to our MSRs was $ 96.4 billion and $ 97.4 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company manages the risk associated with changes in the value of the MSRs with an active economic hedging strategy, which includes the purchase of freestanding derivatives.

(1) Represents changes in value of the MSRs due to i) passage of time including the impact from both regularly scheduled loan principal payments and partial 

paydowns, and ii) loans that paid off during the period. 

(2) Represents changes in value primarily driven by market conditions. These changes are recorded in mortgage banking fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

The fair value of MSRs is estimated by using the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, contractual servicing fee income, servicing costs, default rates, ancillary income, and other economic factors, which are determined based on current market interest rates. The valuation does not attempt to forecast or predict the future direction of interest rates. 

The sensitivity analysis below presents the impact of an immediate 10 % and 20 % adverse change in key economic assumptions to the current fair value of MSRs. These sensitivities are hypothetical, with the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs calculated independently without changing any other assumption. Changes in one factor may result in changes in another (e.g., changes in interest rates, which drive changes in prepayment rates, could result in changes in discount rates), which may amplify or counteract the sensitivities. The primary risk inherent in the Company&#8217;s MSRs is an increase in prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans serviced, which is largely dependent upon movements in market interest rates.

NOTE 6 - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 

Citizens, in the normal course of business, engages in a variety of activities with entities that are considered VIEs, as defined by GAAP, with its variable interest arising from contractual, ownership or other monetary interests in the entity. A VIE typically does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. 

For more details regarding the Company&#8217;s involvement with VIEs see Note 11 in the Company&#8217;s 2023 Form 10-K.

Consolidated VIEs 

The Company has consolidated VIEs related to secured borrowings collateralized by auto loans. The following table summarizes the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for the Company&#8217;s consolidated VIEs: 

(dollars in millions) June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Assets: Cash and due from banks $ &#8212; &#160; $ 13 &#160; Interest-bearing deposits in banks

Secured Borrowings 

Citizens utilizes a portion of its auto loan portfolio to support certain secured borrowing arrangements, which provide a source of funding for the Company and involves the transfer of auto loans to bankruptcy remote special purpose entities (&#8220;SPEs&#8221;). These SPEs then issue asset-backed notes to third-parties collateralized by the transferred loans. 

The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations. Creditors of these VIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company. The performance of the loans transferred to the SPEs is the most significant driver impacting the economic performance of the VIEs. 

Unconsolidated VIEs 

Citizens is involved with various VIEs that are not consolidated including lending to special purpose entities, investments in asset-backed securities and investments in entities that sponsor affordable housing, renewable energy and economic development projects. Citizens&#8217; maximum exposure to loss resulting from its involvement with these entities is limited to the balance sheet carrying amount of its investments, unfunded commitments, and the outstanding principal balance of loans to special purpose entities. 

A summary of these investments is presented below: 

(dollars in millions) June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Lending to special purpose entities included in loans and leases $ 4,378 &#160; $ 4,760 &#160; LIHTC investments included in other assets 2,537 &#160; 2,444 &#160; LIHTC unfunded commitments included in other liabilities 1,068 &#160; 1,025 &#160; Asset-backed investments included in HTM securities 448 &#160; 488 &#160; Renewable energy investments included in other assets 283 &#160; 314 &#160; NMTC investments included in other assets 3 &#160; 3 &#160; 

Lending to Special Purpose Entities 

Citizens provides lending facilities to third-party sponsored special purpose entities. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the lending facilities had undrawn commitments to extend credit of $ 2.9 billion and $ 2.7 billion, respectively. For more information on commitments to extend credit see Note 11. 

Asset-backed securities 

The Company&#8217;s investments in asset-backed securities are collateralized by education loans sold to a third-party sponsored VIE. Citizens acts as the primary servicer for the sold loans and receives a servicing fee. A third-party servicer is responsible for all loans that become significantly delinquent. 

Low Income Housing Tax Credit Partnerships 

The purpose of the Company&#8217;s LIHTC investments is to assist in achieving the goals of the Community Reinvestment Act and to earn an adequate return of capital. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 63 

Renewable Energy Entities 

The Company&#8217;s investments in certain renewable energy entities provide benefits from government incentives and other tax attributes (e.g., tax depreciation). 

Contingent commitments related to the Company&#8217;s renewable energy investments were $ 63 million at June 30, 2024, and are expected to be paid in varying amounts through 2026. These payments are contingent upon the level of electricity production attained by the renewable energy entity relative to its targeted threshold and changes in the production tax credit rates set by the Internal Revenue Service. 

New Markets Tax Credit Program 

The Company participates in the NMTC program which provides a tax incentive for private sector investment into economic development projects and businesses located in low-income communities. 

The following table summarizes the impact to the Consolidated Statements of Operations relative to the Company&#8217;s tax credit programs for which it has elected to apply the proportional amortization method of accounting:

NOTE 8 - DERIVATIVES 

In the normal course of business, Citizens enters into derivative transactions to meet the financing and hedging needs of its customers and reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These transactions include interest rate swap contracts, interest rate options, foreign exchange contracts, residential loan commitment rate locks, interest rate future contracts, swaptions, certain commodities, forward commitments to sell TBAs, forward sale contracts and purchase options. The Company does not use derivatives for speculative purposes. Information regarding the valuation methodology and inputs used to estimate the fair value of the Company&#8217;s derivative instruments is described in Note 20 in the Company&#8217;s 2023 Form 10-K.

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 66 

The Company&#8217;s derivative transactions are internally divided into three sub-groups: institutional, customer facilitation and residential loan. Certain derivative transactions within these sub-groups are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, as described below: 

Derivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments 

The Company&#8217;s institutional derivatives qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The net interest accruals on interest rate swaps designated in a fair value or cash flow hedge relationship are treated as an adjustment to interest income or interest expense of the item being hedged. All hedging relationships are formally documented at inception, as well as risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. In addition, the effectiveness of hedge relationships is monitored during the duration of the hedge period. The methods utilized to assess hedge effectiveness vary based on the hedge relationship and each relationship is monitored to ensure that management&#8217;s initial intent continues to be satisfied. Hedge accounting treatment is discontinued when the derivative is terminated or when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to be, or has ceased to be, effective as a hedge. Changes in the fair value of a derivative are reflected in earnings after termination of the hedge relationship. 

Fair Value Hedges 

In a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged asset or liability attributable to the risk being hedged are recognized in the same income statement line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the changes in fair value occur. The Company has entered into fair value hedges to manage interest rate risk within its AFS securities and long-term borrowed funds portfolios. 

The following table presents the effect of fair value hedges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the respective line items affected for each hedged item:

(1) Includes the amortized cost basis of closed portfolios used to designate hedging relationships under the portfolio layer method. The hedged item is a layer of the closed portfolio which is expected to be remaining at the end of the hedging relationship. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amortized cost basis of the closed portfolios used in these hedging relationships was $ 6.7 billion and $ 5.9 billion, respectively, including associated cumulative basis adjustments of $( 88 ) million and $ 39 million, respectively. The amount of the designated hedging instruments was $ 4.8 billion and $ 4.0 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Cash Flow Hedges 

In a cash flow hedge the entire change in the fair value of the interest rate swap included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is initially recorded in OCI and is subsequently reclassified from AOCI into earnings in the period during which the hedged item affects earnings. 

Citizens has entered into interest rate swap agreements designed to hedge a portion of the Company&#8217;s floating-rate assets and liabilities. All of these swaps are deemed highly effective cash flow hedges. The Company has also entered into certain interest rate option agreements that utilize interest rate floors and caps, or some combination thereof, providing the ability to hedge the variability in cash flows within different interest rate bands. Option premiums paid and received are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are amortized over the life of the instruments. 

The following table presents the pre-tax net gains (losses) recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges: 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Amount of pre-tax net gains (losses) recognized in OCI ($ 177 ) ($ 680 ) ($ 727 ) ($ 447 ) Amount of pre-tax net gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into interest income ( 232 ) ( 137 ) ( 435 ) ( 264 ) Amount of pre-tax net gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into interest expense &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 

Using the interest rate curve at June 30, 2024 with respect to cash flow hedge strategies, the Company estimates that approximately $ 984 million in pre-tax net losses will be reclassified from AOCI to net interest income over the next 12 months, including $ 448 million related to terminated swaps. This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations and the addition of other hedges subsequent to June 30, 2024. 

Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments 

The Company offers derivatives to customers in connection with their risk management needs consisting primarily of interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity contracts. Market risk exposure from customer transactions is primarily managed by entering into a variety of hedging transactions with third-party dealers. Gains and losses on customer-related derivatives are reported in foreign exchange and derivatives products in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Residential mortgage loans that will be sold in the secondary market and the related loan commitments, which are considered derivatives, are accounted for at fair value. Forward contracts to sell mortgage-backed securities are utilized to hedge the fair value of the loans and related commitments. Gains and losses on the loans and related commitments, and the derivatives used to economically hedge them, are reported in mortgage banking fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 68 

Residential MSRs are accounted for at fair value. Derivatives utilized to hedge the fair value of residential MSRs include interest rate futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts to purchase mortgage-backed securities. Gains and losses on residential MSRs and the related derivatives are reported in mortgage banking fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

The following table presents the effect of economic hedges on noninterest income:

A summary of outstanding off-balance sheet arrangements is presented below. For more information on these arrangements, see Note 19 in the Company&#8217;s 2023 Form 10-K.

Commitments to Extend Credit 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers in accordance with conditions contractually agreed upon in advance. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements. 

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 71 

Letters of Credit 

Letters of credit in the table above reflect commercial, standby financial and standby performance letters of credit. Financial and performance standby letters of credit are issued by the Company for the benefit of its customers. They are used as conditional guarantees of payment to a third party in the event the customer either fails to make specific payments (financial) or fails to complete a specific project (performance). The Company&#8217;s exposure to credit loss in the event of counterparty nonperformance in connection with the above instruments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Letters of credit are generally collateralized by cash, accounts receivable, inventory or investment securities. Credit risk associated with letters of credit is considered in determining the appropriate amount of allowances for unfunded commitments. Standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit are issued for terms of up to two years and one year , respectively. 

Other Commitments 

Citizens has additional off-balance sheet arrangements that are summarized below: 

&#8226; Marketing Rights - During 2003, Citizens entered into a 25-year agreement to acquire the naming and marketing rights of a baseball stadium in Pennsylvania. 

&#8226; Loans sold with recourse - Citizens is an originator and servicer of residential mortgages and routinely sells such mortgage loans in the secondary market and to GSEs. In the context of such sales, the Company makes certain representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the underlying loans and, as a result, may be contractually required to repurchase such loans or indemnify certain parties against losses for certain breaches of those representations and warranties. The Company also sells the government guaranteed portion of certain SBA loans to outside investors, for which it retains the servicing rights. 

&#8226; Risk Participation Agreements - RPAs are guarantees issued by the Company to other parties for a fee, whereby the Company agrees to participate in the credit risk of a derivative customer of the other party. The current amount of credit exposure is spread out over multiple counterparties. At June 30, 2024, the remaining terms on these RPAs ranged from less than one year to nine years . 

Contingencies 

The Company operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to potentially significant risks. A certain amount of litigation ordinarily results from the nature of the Company&#8217;s banking and other businesses. The Company is a party to legal proceedings, including class actions. The Company is also the subject of investigations, reviews, subpoenas, and regulatory matters arising out of its normal business operations which, in some instances, relate to concerns about fair lending, unfair and/or deceptive practices, and mortgage-related issues. In addition, the Company engages in discussions with relevant governmental and regulatory authorities on a regular and ongoing basis regarding various issues, and any issues discussed or identified may result in investigatory or other action being taken. Litigation and regulatory matters may result in settlements, damages, fines, penalties, public or private censure, increased costs, required remediation, restrictions on business activities, or other impacts on the Company. 

In these disputes and proceedings, the Company contests liability and the amount of damages as appropriate. Given their complex nature, and based on the Company's experience, it may be years before some of these matters are finally resolved. Moreover, before liability can be reasonably estimated for a claim, numerous legal and factual issues may need to be examined, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal issues relevant to the proceedings in question. The Company cannot predict with certainty if, how, or when such claims will be resolved or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, may be, particularly for claims that are at an early stage in their development or where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages. The Company recognizes a provision for a claim when, in the opinion of management after seeking legal advice, it is probable that a liability exists and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In many proceedings, however, it is not possible to determine whether any loss is probable or to estimate the amount of any loss. 

Based on information currently available, the advice of legal counsel and other advisers, and established reserves, management believes that the aggregate liabilities, if any, potentially arising from these proceedings will not have a materially adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTE 12 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

Citizens measures or monitors many of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is used on a recurring basis for assets and liabilities for which fair value is the required or elected measurement basis of accounting. Fair value is also used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate assets for impairment or for disclosure purposes. Nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve the application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Fair value measurement guidance is also applied to determine amounts reported for certain disclosures in this Note for assets and liabilities that are not required to be reported at fair value in the financial statements. 

Fair Value Option 

Citizens elected to account for residential mortgage LHFS and certain commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate LHFS at fair value. The following table presents the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate unpaid principal balance of LHFS measured at fair value:

For more information on the election of the fair value option for these assets see Note 20 in the Company&#8217;s 2023 Form 10-K. 

Recurring Fair Value Measurements 

Citizens utilizes a variety of valuation techniques to measure its assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. For more information on the valuation techniques utilized to measure fair value on a recurring basis, see Note 20 in the Company&#8217;s 2023 Form 10-K. 

Short-term investments 

Short-term investments include corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury securities managed by the Company&#8217;s trading desks. U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy as quoted prices in active markets are readily available. The fair value of corporate bonds is estimated using a combination of direct market quotes for a particular bond, or a comparable bond if recent market data is not available, and a discounted cash flow model that incorporates certain credit attributes of the bond issuer. External pricing services are utilized to corroborate the fair value of corporate bonds, which may result in an adjustment to the underlying bond&#8217;s valuation if price differences exceed certain thresholds. Corporate bonds are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy given the observable market inputs utilized to value these instruments. Short-term investments are included in interest-bearing deposits in banks in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Short-term borrowed funds 

Short-term borrowed funds include short positions in corporate bonds held by the Company&#8217;s trading desks and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. See &#8220;Short-term investments&#8221; above for more information regarding the valuation techniques utilized to value corporate bonds.

NOTE 16 - BUSINESS OPERATING SEGMENTS 

Citizens is managed by its Chief Executive Officer on a segment basis. The Company&#8217;s three business operating segments are Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, and Non-Core. The business operating segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served. Each business operating segment has a segment head that reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer, who has final authority over resource allocation decisions and performance assessment. The business operating segments reflect this management structure and the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Chief Executive Officer. 

Developing and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business operating segments is a dynamic process. Accordingly, financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines are updated, or organizational structure changes occur. 

See Note 1 for a description of segment changes made during the third quarter of 2023. For more information on the Company&#8217;s business operating segments, as well as Other non-segment operations, see Note 26 in the Company&#8217;s 2023 Form 10-K.
