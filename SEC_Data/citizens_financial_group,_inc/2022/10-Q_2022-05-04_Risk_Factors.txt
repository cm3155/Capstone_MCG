Risks Related to our Business 

Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine may adversely affect us and create significant risks and uncertainties for our business, with the ultimate impact dependent on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable. 

Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine has negatively impacted the global and U.S. economies including supply chain disruptions, rising prices for oil and other commodities, volatility in capital markets and foreign currency exchange rates, rising interest rates and heightened cybersecurity risks. The extent to which the invasion adversely affects our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our liquidity and regulatory capital ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including the extent and duration of the invasion and economic sanctions imposed on Russia, and the immeasurable humanitarian toll inflicted on Ukraine. If the invasion adversely affects us, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks related to our business.
