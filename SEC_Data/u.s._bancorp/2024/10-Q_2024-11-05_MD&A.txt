Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Overview
Earnings Summary U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the “Company”)
reported net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $1.7 billion for the third
quarter of 2024, or $1.03 per diluted common share, compared with $1.5 billion,
or $0.91 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2023. Return on
average assets and return on average common equity were 1.03 percent and
12.4 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 0.91
percent and 11.9 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023. The results
for the third quarter of 2023 included the impact of $284 million ($213 million
net-of-tax) of merger and integration charges associated with the acquisition of
MUFG Union Bank, N.A. (“MUB”), which decreased diluted earnings per
common share for the third quarter of 2023 by $0.14.
Total net revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $168 million (2.4 percent)
lower than the third quarter of 2023, reflecting a 2.4 percent decrease in net
interest income and a 2.4 percent decrease in noninterest income. The
decrease in net interest income from the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due
to the impact of higher interest rates on deposit mix and pricing, partially offset
by higher rates on earning assets and changes in balance sheet composition.
The decrease in noninterest income was driven by net losses on the sales of
investment securities, lower service charges and lower other noninterest
income, partially offset by higher fee revenue across all other categories.
Noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2024 was $326 million (7.2
percent) lower than the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to the impact of
merger and integration charges in the prior year and lower other noninterest
expense, partially offset by higher compensation and employee benefits
expense.
The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 was $42 million
(8.2 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2023, driven by higher net chargeoffs. Net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 were $564 million, compared
with $420 million in the third quarter of 2023. Refer to “Corporate Risk Profile”
for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs,
nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in
assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance
for credit losses.
Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp for the first nine months of 2024 was
$4.6 billion, or $2.77 per diluted common share, compared with $4.6 billion, or
$2.79 per diluted common share, for the first nine months of 2023. Return on
average assets and return on average common equity were 0.94 percent and
11.6 percent, respectively, for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 0.92
percent and 12.3 percent, respectively, for the first nine months of 2023. The
results for the first nine months of 2024 included the impact of $291 million
($218 million net-of-tax) of notable items, including $155 million of merger and
integration charges and a $136 million charge for an increase in the FDIC
special assessment to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund related to
certain 2023 bank failures. Combined, these items
decreased diluted earnings per common share for the first nine months of 2024
by $0.14. The results for the first nine months of 2023 included the impact of
$1.1 billion ($828 million net-of-tax) of notable items, including $838 million of
merger and integration charges, and $243 million of provision for credit losses
and an additional $22 million of losses related to balance sheet repositioning
and capital management actions. Combined, these items decreased diluted
earnings per common share for the first nine months of 2023 by $0.53.
Total net revenue for the first nine months of 2024 was $936 million (4.4
percent) lower than the first nine months of 2023, reflecting an 8.6 percent
decrease in net interest income, partially offset by a 2.7 percent increase in
noninterest income. The decrease in net interest income from the first nine
months of 2023 was primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on
deposit mix and pricing, partially offset by higher rates on earning assets and
changes in balance sheet composition. The increase in noninterest income was
driven by higher fee revenue across most categories, partially offset by higher
net losses on the sales of investment securities, lower service charges and
lower other noninterest income.
Noninterest expense in the first nine months of 2024 was $777 million (5.7
percent) lower than the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to lower merger
and integration charges, partially offset by higher compensation and employee
benefits expense and the impact of the FDIC special assessment.
The provision for credit losses for the first nine months of 2024 was $85
million (4.8 percent) lower than the first nine months of 2023, driven by the
impacts of balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions taken in
the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher net charge-offs in the
current year. Net charge-offs in the first nine months of 2024 were $1.6 billion,
compared with $1.4 billion in the first nine months of 2023. Refer to “Corporate
Risk Profile” for further information on the provision for credit losses, net chargeoffs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in
assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance
for credit losses.
Statement of Income Analysis
Net Interest Income Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, was
$4.2 billion in the third quarter and $12.2 billion in the first nine months of 2024,
representing decreases of $102 million (2.4 percent) and $1.2 billion (8.6
percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2023. The decreases
were primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on deposit mix and
pricing, partially offset by higher rates on earning assets and changes in balance
sheet composition. Average earning assets for the third quarter of 2024 were
$1.9 billion (0.3 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2023, reflecting
increases in investment securities and other earning assets, partially offset by
decreases in loans and interest-bearing deposits with banks. Average earning
assets for the first nine months of 2024 were $4.8 billion (0.8 percent) lower than
the first nine months of 2023, reflecting a
4 U.S. Bancorp
decrease in loans, partially offset by increases in investment securities and
interest-bearing deposits with banks. The net interest margin, on a taxableequivalent basis, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 2.74
percent and 2.70 percent, respectively, compared with 2.81 percent and 2.94
percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The
decreases in net interest margin from the same periods of the prior year were
primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on deposit mix and pricing,
partially offset by higher rates on earning assets and changes in balance sheet
composition. Refer to the “Consolidated Daily Average Balance Sheet and
Related Yields and Rates” table for further information on net interest income.
Average total loans in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were
$2.8 billion (0.7 percent) and $10.8 billion (2.8 percent) lower, respectively, than
the same periods of 2023. The decreases were primarily due to lower other
retail loans, commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, partially offset
by higher credit card loans and residential mortgages. The decreases in average
other retail loans were driven by lower automobile loans. The decreases in
average commercial loans were primarily due to decreased demand as
corporate customers accessed the capital markets. The decreases in average
commercial real estate loans were primarily due to payoffs exceeding a reduced
level of new originations. The increases in average credit cards loans were
primarily driven by higher spend volume. The increases in residential mortgages
were primarily driven by originations.
Average investment securities in the third quarter and first nine months of
2024 were $3.7 billion (2.2 percent) and $2.0 billion (1.2 percent) higher,
respectively, than the same periods of 2023, primarily due to balance sheet
positioning and liquidity management.
Average total deposits for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024
were $3.5 billion (0.7 percent) lower and $1.9 billion (0.4 percent) higher,
respectively, than the same periods of 2023. Average noninterest-bearing
deposits for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were $16.6 billion
(17.0 percent) and $30.5 billion (26.9 percent) lower, respectively, than the same
periods of 2023, driven by decreases in Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and
Institutional Banking, and Consumer and Business Banking balances. Average
total savings deposits for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were
$9.0 billion (2.5 percent) and $20.0 billion (5.7 percent) higher, respectively, than
the same periods of 2023, driven by increases in Wealth, Corporate,
Commercial and Institutional Banking, and Consumer and Business Banking
balances. Average time deposits for the third quarter and first nine months of
2024 were $4.1 billion (7.5 percent) and $12.5 billion (28.0 percent) higher,
respectively, than the same periods of 2023, mainly due to increases in
Consumer and Business Banking balances. Changes in time deposits are
primarily related to those deposits managed as an alternative to other funding
sources, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics.
Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses was $557 million in
the third quarter of 2024, representing an
increase of $42 million (8.2 percent) from the third quarter of 2023, driven by
higher net charge-offs in the current year. Net charge-offs increased $144 million
(34.3 percent) in the third quarter of 2024, compared with the third quarter of
2023, reflecting higher credit card, commercial and commercial real estate loan
net charge-offs. The provision for credit losses was $1.7 billion in the first nine
months of 2024, representing a decrease of $85 million (4.8 percent) from the
first nine months of 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the impacts of
balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions in the second
quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher net charge-offs in the current year. Net
charge-offs increased $148 million (10.3 percent) in the first nine months of
2024, compared with the first nine months of 2023, reflecting higher credit card
and commercial loan net charge-offs, partially offset by the impacts of chargeoffs in the prior year related to acquired loans and balance sheet repositioning
and capital management actions. Refer to “Corporate Risk Profile” for further
information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming
assets and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit
quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses.
Noninterest Income Noninterest income was $2.7 billion in the third quarter
and $8.2 billion in the first nine months of 2024, representing a decrease of $66
million (2.4 percent) and an increase of $216 million (2.7 percent), respectively,
compared with the same periods of 2023. The decrease in noninterest income in
the third quarter of 2024, compared with the third quarter of 2023, was driven by
net losses on the sales of investment securities, lower service charges and
lower other noninterest income, partially offset by higher commercial products
revenue, trust and investment management fees and payment services
revenue. The increase in noninterest income in the first nine months of 2024,
compared with the first nine months of 2023, was driven by higher commercial
products revenue, trust and investment management fees, payment services
revenue and mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by higher net losses on
the sales of investment securities, lower service charges and lower other
noninterest income. Commercial products revenue increased in the current year
primarily due to higher corporate bond fees and new product growth. Trust and
investment management fees increased primarily due to business growth and
favorable market conditions. Payment services revenue increased primarily due
to higher merchant processing services revenue due to business volume growth
and favorable rates, along with increased card revenue due to favorable rates.
Mortgage banking revenue increased in the first nine months of 2024, compared
with the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by a gain on the sale of
mortgage servicing rights in the second quarter of 2024, along with the impact of
balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions taken in the
second quarter of 2023.

Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense was $4.2 billion in the third quarter
and $12.9 billion in the first nine months of 2024, representing decreases of
$326 million (7.2 percent) and $777 million (5.7 percent), respectively, from the
same periods of 2023. The decreases from the prior year reflected lower merger
and integration charges and lower other noninterest expense, partially offset by
higher compensation and employee benefits expense. The decrease in
noninterest expense in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first
nine months of 2023, was further offset by the impact of the FDIC special
assessment in the current year. Compensation and employee benefits expense
increased in the current year primarily due to higher commissions and
performance-based incentives. Marketing and business development expense
increased in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first nine months
of 2023, primarily due to the timing of campaigns. Professional services
expense decreased in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the
first nine months of 2023, primarily due to synergies from the MUB acquisition.
Income Tax Expense The provision for income taxes was $350 million (an
effective rate of 16.9 percent) for the third quarter and $1.1 billion (an effective
rate of 19.7 percent) for the first nine months of 2024, compared with $431
million (an effective rate of 22.0 percent) and $1.3 billion (an effective rate of
21.6 percent) for the same periods of 2023, respectively. The tax rate in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2024 reflected the impact of favorable
settlements. For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 11 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Balance Sheet Analysis
Loans The Company’s loan portfolio was $374.2 billion at September 30, 2024,
compared with $373.8 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $329 million
(0.1 percent). The increase was driven by higher residential mortgages and
commercial loans, partially offset by lower commercial real estate loans and
other retail loans.
Residential mortgages held in the loan portfolio increased $2.5 billion (2.2
percent) at September 30, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, driven by
originations. Residential mortgages originated and placed in the Company’s loan
portfolio include jumbo mortgages and branch-originated first lien home equity
loans to borrowers with high credit quality.
Commercial loans increased $1.8 billion (1.3 percent) at September 30,
2024, compared with December 31, 2023, primarily due to growth in corporate
banking.
Credit card loans increased $477 million (1.7 percent) at September 30,
2024, compared with December 31, 2023, primarily driven by higher spend
volume.
Commercial real estate loans decreased $2.8 billion (5.3 percent) at
September 30, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, primarily due to
payoffs exceeding a reduced level of new originations.
Other retail loans decreased $1.6 billion (3.5 percent) at September 30,
2024, compared with December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in auto
loans.
The Company generally retains portfolio loans through maturity; however,
the Company’s intent may change over time based upon various factors such as
ongoing asset/liability management activities, assessment of product profitability,
credit risk, liquidity needs, and capital implications. If the Company’s intent or
ability to hold an existing portfolio loan changes, it is transferred to loans held for
sale.
Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale, consisting primarily of residential
mortgages to be sold in the secondary market, were $3.2 billion at
September 30, 2024, compared with $2.2 billion at December 31, 2023. The
increase in loans held for sale was principally due to a higher level of mortgage
loan closings in the third quarter of 2024, compared with the fourth
quarter of 2023. Almost all of the residential mortgage loans the Company
originates or purchases for sale follow guidelines that allow the loans to be sold
into existing, highly liquid secondary markets, in particular in government
agency transactions and to government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”).
Investment Securities Investment securities totaled $161.7 billion at
September 30, 2024, compared with $153.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The
$8.0 billion (5.2 percent) increase was primarily due to net investment
purchases driven by balance sheet positioning and liquidity management, along
with a $1.2 billion favorable change in net unrealized gains (losses) on
available-for-sale investment securities.
The Company’s available-for-sale investment securities are carried at fair
value with changes in fair value reflected in other comprehensive income (loss)
unless a portion of a security’s unrealized loss is related to credit and an
allowance for credit losses is necessary. At September 30, 2024, the Company’s
net unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities were $5.7
billion ($4.3 billion net-of-tax), compared with $6.9 billion ($5.2 billion net-of-tax)
at December 31, 2023. The favorable change in net unrealized gains (losses)
was primarily due to increases in the fair value of mortgage-backed securities as
a result of changes in interest rates. Gross unrealized losses on available-forsale investment securities totaled $5.9 billion at September 30, 2024, compared
with $7.1 billion at December 31, 2023. When evaluating credit losses, the
Company considers various factors such as the nature of the investment
security, the credit ratings or financial condition of the issuer, the extent of the
unrealized loss, expected cash flows of the underlying collateral, the existence
of any government or agency guarantees, and market conditions. At
September 30, 2024, the Company had no plans to sell securities with
unrealized losses, and believed it was more likely than not that it would not be
required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost.
Refer to Notes 3 and 14 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for further information on investment securities.

Deposits Total deposits were $521.1 billion at September 30, 2024, compared
with $512.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The $8.8 billion (1.7 percent) increase
in total deposits reflected increases in time deposits and total savings deposits,
partially offset by a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. Time deposits
increased $7.1 billion (13.5 percent) at September 30, 2024, compared with
December 31, 2023, driven by higher Consumer and Business Banking
balances. Changes in time deposits are primarily related to those deposits
managed as an alternative to other funding sources, based largely on relative
pricing and liquidity characteristics. Money market deposit balances increased
$11.6 billion (5.8 percent), primarily due to higher Consumer and Business
Banking, and Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking
balances. Savings account balances decreased $6.2 billion (14.3 percent),
driven by lower Consumer and Business Banking balances. Interest checking
balances decreased $485 million (0.4 percent), primarily due to lower Consumer
and Business Banking balances, partially offset by higher Wealth, Corporate,
Commercial and Institutional Banking balances. Noninterest-bearing deposits
decreased $3.2 billion (3.5 percent) at September 30, 2024, compared with
December 31, 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in Wealth, Corporate,
Commercial and Institutional Banking balances due to the impact of higher
interest rates.
Borrowings The Company utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowings as
part of its asset/liability management and funding strategies. Short-term
borrowings, which include federal funds purchased, commercial paper,
repurchase agreements, borrowings secured by high-grade assets and other
short-term borrowings, were $23.7 billion at
September 30, 2024, compared with $15.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The
$8.4 billion (55.2 percent) increase in short-term borrowings was primarily due to
increases in short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances and
repurchase agreement balances, partially offset by lower commercial paper
balances. Long-term debt was $54.8 billion at September 30, 2024, compared
with $51.5 billion at December 31, 2023. The $3.4 billion (6.5 percent) increase
was primarily due to $6.1 billion of medium-term note issuances and a $2.5
billion increase in FHLB advances, partially offset by $4.6 billion of medium-term
note and $1.0 billion of subordinated note repayments. Refer to the “Liquidity
Risk Management” section for discussion of liquidity management of the
Company.
Corporate Risk Profile
Overview Managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a
financial services company. The Company’s Board of Directors has approved a
risk management framework which establishes governance and risk
management requirements for all risk-taking activities. This framework includes
Company and business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for
the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business
objectives and initiatives. The Board of Directors, primarily through its Risk
Management Committee, oversees performance relative to the risk
management framework, risk appetite statements, and other policy
requirements.
The Executive Risk Committee (“ERC”), which is chaired by the Chief Risk
Officer and includes the Chief Executive Officer and other members of the
executive management

(a)

(a)
(b)(c)

team, oversees execution against the risk management framework and risk
appetite statements. The ERC focuses on current and emerging risks, including
strategic and reputation risks, by directing timely and comprehensive actions.
Senior operating committees have also been established, each responsible for
overseeing a specified category of risk.
The Company’s most prominent risk exposures are credit, interest rate,
market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic, and reputation. Credit risk is
the risk of loss associated with a change in the credit profile or the failure of a
borrower or counterparty to meet its contractual obligations. Interest rate risk is
the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital, or market valuations,
arising from the impact of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and security prices that
may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as trading and
available-for-sale investment securities, mortgage loans held for sale
(“MLHFS”), mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) and derivatives that are
accounted for on a fair value basis. Liquidity risk is the risk that financial
condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the
Company’s inability, or perceived inability, to meet its cash flow obligations in a
timely and complete manner in either normal or stressed conditions. Operational
risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, people (including
human errors or misconduct), or adverse external events, including the risk of
loss resulting from breaches in data security. Operational risk can also include
the risk of loss due to failures by third parties with which the Company does
business. Compliance risk is the risk that the Company may suffer legal or
regulatory sanctions, financial losses, and reputational damage if it fails to
adhere to compliance requirements and the Company’s compliance policies.
Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience
arising from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business
decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and
operating environment. Reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated
earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from negative public
opinion. This risk may impair the Company’s competitiveness by affecting its
ability to establish new relationships or services, or continue serving existing
relationships. In addition to the risks identified above, other risk factors exist that
may impact the Company. Refer to “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a detailed
discussion of these factors.
The Company’s Board and management-level governance committees are
supported by a “three lines of defense” model for establishing effective checks
and balances. The first line of defense, the business lines, manages risks in
conformity with established limits and policy requirements. In turn, business line
leaders and their risk officers establish programs to ensure conformity with these
limits and policy requirements. The second line of defense, which includes the
Chief Risk Officer’s organization as well as policy and oversight activities of
corporate support functions, translates risk appetite and strategy into actionable
risk limits and policies. The second line of defense monitors first line of defense
conformity with limits and policies and provides reporting and escalation of
emerging risks and other concerns to senior management and the Risk
Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The third line of defense,
internal audit, is responsible for providing the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors and senior management with independent assessment and assurance
regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s governance, risk management
and control processes.
Management regularly provides reports to the Risk Management Committee
of the Board of Directors. The Risk Management Committee discusses with
management the Company’s risk management performance and provides a
summary of key risks to the entire Board of Directors, covering the status of
existing matters, areas of potential future concern and specific information on
certain types of loss events. The Risk Management Committee considers
quarterly reports by management assessing the Company’s performance
relative to the risk appetite statements and the associated risk limits, including:
• Macroeconomic environment and other qualitative considerations, such as
regulatory and compliance changes, litigation developments, geopolitical
events, and technology and cybersecurity;
• Credit measures, including adversely rated and nonperforming loans,
leveraged transactions, credit concentrations and lending limits;
• Interest rate and market risk, including market value and net income
simulation, and trading-related Value at Risk (“VaR”);
• Liquidity risk, including funding projections under various stressed scenarios;
• Operational and compliance risk, including losses stemming from events such
as fraud, processing errors, control breaches, breaches in data security or
adverse business decisions, as well as reporting on technology performance,
and various legal and regulatory compliance measures;
• Capital ratios and projections, including regulatory measures and stressed
scenarios; and
• Strategic and reputation risk considerations, impacts and responses.
Credit Risk Management The Company’s strategy for credit risk management
includes well-defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria,
and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and
consumer credit exposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a
geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and
management reviews of loans exhibiting deterioration of credit quality. In
evaluating its credit risk, the Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting
activities, the loan portfolio composition (including product mix and geographic,
industry or customer-specific factors), collateral values, trends in loan
performance and macroeconomic factors, such as changes in unemployment
rates, gross domestic product levels, inflation, interest rates and consumer
bankruptcy filings. The Risk Management Committee oversees the Company’s
credit risk management process.
In addition, credit quality ratings, as defined by the Company, are an
important part of the Company’s overall
U.S. Bancorp 9
credit risk management and evaluation of its allowance for credit losses. Loans
with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on the Company’s rating
scale for problem credits, as minimal credit risk has been identified. Loans with
a special mention or classified rating (defined by internally assessed rating or
exception based monitoring credits in consumer lending and small business
loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing, nonaccrual loans and
loans in a junior lien position that are current but are behind a first lien position
on nonaccrual), encompass all loans held by the Company that it considers to
have a potential or well-defined weakness that may put full collection of
contractual cash flows at risk. The Company’s internal credit quality ratings for
consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming status.
Refer to Note 4 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion of the Company’s loan portfolios including internal credit quality
ratings. In addition, refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Credit
Risk Management” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2023, for a more detailed discussion on credit risk
management processes.
The Company manages its credit risk, in part, through diversification of its
loan portfolio which is achieved through limit setting by product type criteria,
such as industry, geography and identification of credit concentrations. The
Company categorizes its loan portfolio into two segments, which is the level at
which it develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the
allowance for credit losses. The Company’s two loan portfolio segments are
commercial lending and consumer lending.
The commercial lending segment includes loans and leases made to small
business, middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, financial
institution, non-profit and public sector customers. Key risk characteristics
relevant to commercial lending segment loans include the industry and
geography of the borrower’s business, purpose of the loan, repayment source,
borrower’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, loan covenants, and nature of
pledged collateral, if any, as well as macroeconomic factors such as
unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads
and long-term interest rates. These risk characteristics, among others, are
considered in determining estimates about the likelihood of default by the
borrowers and the severity of loss in the event of default. The Company
considers these risk characteristics in assigning internal risk ratings to, or
forecasting losses on, these loans, which are the significant factors in
determining the allowance for credit losses for loans in the commercial lending
segment.
The consumer lending segment represents loans and leases made to
consumer customers, including residential mortgages, credit card loans, and
other retail loans such as revolving consumer lines, auto loans and leases and
home equity loans and lines. Key risk characteristics relevant to consumer
lending segment loans primarily relate to the borrowers’ capacity and willingness
to repay and include unemployment rates, consumer bankruptcy filings,
household debt levels, real disposable income and other macroeconomic
factors, customer payment history and credit scores, effect of higher interest
rates on variable rate or adjustable rate loans, and in some cases, updated
loan-to-value (“LTV”) information
reflecting current market conditions on secured loans. These and other risk
characteristics are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels, bankruptcies and
losses which are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit
losses for the consumer lending segment.
The Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various
classes based on their underlying risk characteristics. The two classes within the
commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate
loans. The three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential
mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans.
The Company’s consumer lending segment utilizes several distinct business
processes and channels to originate consumer credit, including traditional
branch lending, mobile and online banking, indirect lending, alliance
partnerships and correspondent banks. Each distinct underwriting and
origination activity manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan
production commensurate with the differing risk profiles.
Residential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime borrowers
and are performed through the Company’s branches, loan production offices,
mobile and online services, and a wholesale network of originators. The
Company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance
sheet or sell the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing
rights and customer relationships. Utilizing the secondary markets enables the
Company to effectively reduce its credit and other asset/liability risks. For
residential mortgages that are retained in the Company’s portfolio and for home
equity and second mortgages, credit risk is managed by adherence to LTV and
borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process.
The Company estimates updated LTV information on its outstanding
residential mortgages quarterly, based on a method that combines automated
valuation model updates and relevant home price indices. LTV is the ratio of the
loan’s outstanding principal balance to the current estimate of property value.
For home equity and second mortgages, combined loan-to-value (“CLTV”) is the
combination of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second lien
outstanding principal balance, relative to the current estimate of property value.
Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily due to lack of availability of
relevant automated valuation model and/or home price indices values, or lack of
necessary valuation data on acquired loans.

Loan Delinquencies Trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator, among other
considerations, of credit risk within the Company’s loan portfolios. The entire
balance of a loan account is considered delinquent if the minimum payment
contractually required to be made is not received by the date specified on the
billing statement. Delinquent loans purchased and loans that could be
purchased from GNMA mortgage pools under delinquent loan repurchase
options, whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing
Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans
Affairs, are excluded from delinquency statistics.
Accruing loans 90 days or more past due totaled $738 million at
September 30, 2024, compared with $698 million at December 31, 2023.
Accruing loans 90 days or more past due are not included in nonperforming
assets and continue to accrue interest because they are adequately secured by
collateral, are in the process of collection and are reasonably expected to result
in repayment or restoration to current status, or are managed in homogeneous
portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines.
The ratio of accruing loans 90 days or more past due to total loans was 0.20
percent at September 30, 2024 and 0.19 percent at December 31, 2023.

(b) Includes revolving credit, installment and automobile loans.
Modified Loans In certain circumstances, the Company may modify the terms
of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is
experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the
near-term. In most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in
interest rate, extension of the maturity date or other concessionary modification
of loan terms that would otherwise not be considered.
Modified loans accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised
terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level
commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles, which is
generally six months or greater.
The Company continues to work with borrowers who are experiencing
financial difficulties to modify their loans. Many of the Company’s loan
modifications are determined on a case-by-case basis in connection with
ongoing loan collection processes. The modifications vary within each of the
Company’s loan classes. Commercial lending segment modifications generally
include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase
or decrease to the interest rate. The Company may also work with the borrower
to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses, such as
obtaining additional collateral and/or guarantees to support the loan.
The Company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan
modification programs. The Company modifies residential mortgage loans under
Federal Housing Administration, United States Department of Veterans Affairs,
and its own internal programs. Under these programs, the Company offers
qualifying homeowners the opportunity to permanently modify their loan and
achieve more affordable monthly payments. These modifications may include
adjustments to interest rates, conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates,
extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments, capitalization of accrued
interest and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations, partial forgiveness
of loan principal. In some instances, participation in residential mortgage loan
modification programs requires the customer to complete a short-term trial
period. A permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer
successfully completing the trial period arrangement, and the loan documents
are not modified until that time.
Credit card and other retail loan modifications are generally part of distinct
modification programs providing
(a)
(b)
U.S. Bancorp 13
customers modification solutions over a specified time period, generally up to 60
months.
The Company also makes short-term modifications, in limited circumstances,
to assist borrowers experiencing temporary hardships. Short-term consumer
lending modification programs include payment reductions, deferrals of up to
three past due payments, and the ability to return to current status if the
borrower makes required payments. The Company may also make short-term
modifications to commercial lending loans, with the most common modification
being an extension of the maturity date of three months or less. Such extensions
generally are used when the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is
experiencing some level of financial stress, but the Company believes the
borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed.
Nonperforming Assets The level of nonperforming assets represents another
indicator of the Company’s risk within the loan portfolio. Nonperforming assets
include nonaccrual loans, modified loans not performing in accordance with
modified terms and not accruing interest, modified loans that have not met the
performance period required to return to accrual status, other real estate owned
(“OREO”) and other nonperforming assets owned by the Company. Interest
payments collected from assets on nonaccrual status are generally applied
against the principal balance and not recorded as income. However, interest
income may be recognized for interest payments received if the remaining
carrying amount of the loan is believed to be collectible.
At September 30, 2024, total nonperforming assets were $1.8 billion,
compared to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2023. The $354 million (23.7 percent)
increase in nonperforming assets was primarily due to higher nonperforming
commercial and commercial real estate loans, including the commercial real
estate office sector. Office nonperforming loans as a percent of total office loans
increased to 12.1 percent at September 30, 2024, compared to 7.6 percent at
December 31, 2023. The ratio of total nonperforming assets to total loans and
other real estate was 0.49 percent at September 30, 2024, compared with 0.40
percent at December 31, 2023.
OREO was $21 million at September 30, 2024, compared with $26 million at
December 31, 2023, and was related to foreclosed properties that previously
secured loan balances. These balances exclude foreclosed GNMA loans whose
repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or
guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-offs Total loan net charge-offs were $564 million
for the third quarter of 2024, compared with $420 million for the third quarter of
2023. The increase reflected higher credit card, commercial and commercial real
estate loan net charge-offs. Total loan net charge-offs were $1.6 billion for the
first nine months of 2024, compared with $1.4 billion for the first nine months of
2023, reflecting higher
credit card and commercial loan net charge-offs in the current year, partially
offset by the impacts in the prior year of charge-offs on acquired loans and
charge-offs related to balance sheet repositioning and capital management
actions. The ratio of total loan net charge-offs to average loans outstanding on
an annualized basis for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 0.60
percent and 0.57 percent, respectively,
16 U.S. Bancorp
compared with 0.44 percent and 0.50 percent, respectively, for the same periods
of 2023.
Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses The
allowance for credit losses is established for current expected credit losses on
the Company’s loan and lease portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments.
The allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the
applicable assets, inclusive of expected recoveries. The allowance for credit
losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net
charge-offs.
Management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit
losses on a quarterly basis. Multiple economic scenarios are considered over a
three-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, which includes
increasing consideration of historical loss experience over years two and three.
These economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of
multiple economic variables, and loss estimates are produced that consider the
historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses. After the
forecast period, the Company fully reverts to long-term historical loss
experience, adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan
and lease portfolio, to estimate losses over the remaining life of the portfolio.
The economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly and are designed to
provide a range of reasonable estimates from better to worse than current
expectations. Scenarios are weighted based on the Company’s expectation of
economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment
and consideration of economic forecast uncertainty. Final loss estimates also
consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios, due to the
unique aspects of current conditions and expectations. These factors may
include, but are not limited to, changes in borrower behavior or conditions in
specific lending segments, loan servicing practices, regulatory guidance, and/or
fiscal and monetary policy actions.
Because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded
credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans, the Company utilizes
similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments, which
is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both the
allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are
included in the Company’s analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios.
The allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forward-looking expected
loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses. These
factors include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic variables such as
unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, inflation,
interest rates, and corporate bond spreads, as well as loan and borrower
characteristics, such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer
credit scores, delinquency status, collateral type and available valuation
information, consideration of end-of-term losses on lease residuals, and the
remaining term of the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments. For each loan
portfolio, including those loans modified under various loan modification
programs, model estimates are adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant
changes in portfolio composition, lending policies, underwriting standards, risk
management practices, economic conditions or other factors that may affect
the accuracy of the model. Expected credit loss estimates also include
consideration of expected cash recoveries on loans previously charged-off or
expected recoveries on collateral-dependent loans where recovery is expected
through sale of the collateral at fair value less selling costs. Where loans do not
exhibit similar risk characteristics, an individual analysis is performed to consider
expected credit losses.
For loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with a pool
of loans, the Company establishes individually assessed reserves. Reserves for
individual commercial nonperforming loans greater than $5 million in the
commercial lending segment are analyzed utilizing expected cash flows
discounted using the original effective interest rate, the observable market price
of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, for collateraldependent loans as appropriate.
When evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for
any loans and lines in a junior lien position, the Company considers the
delinquency and modification status of the first lien, based on either servicing
data for first lien accounts serviced by the Company or the status of first lien
mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files when the first lien is
not serviced by the Company. This information is considered within the overall
assessment of economic conditions, problem loans, recent loss experience and
other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses.
When a loan portfolio is purchased, the acquired loans are divided into those
considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration (“PCD”)
and those not considered PCD. An allowance is established for each population
and considers product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio and delinquency
status and refreshed LTV ratios when possible. PCD loans also consider
whether the loan has experienced a charge-off, bankruptcy or significant
deterioration since origination. The allowance established for purchased loans
not considered PCD is recognized through provision expense upon acquisition,
whereas the allowance established for loans considered PCD at acquisition is
offset by an increase in the basis of the acquired loans. Any subsequent
increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans,
regardless of PCD status, are recognized through provision expense, with
charge-offs charged to the allowance. The Company had a total net book
balance of $2.7 billion of PCD loans, primarily related to the MUB acquisition,
included in its loan portfolio at September 30, 2024.
The Company’s methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for
credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used
and allocated to the various loan portfolios. As a result, amounts determined
under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to
consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in
quantitative model adjustments which include, but are not limited to, the
following: model imprecision, imprecision in economic scenario assumptions,
and emerging risks related to either changes in the economic environment that
are affecting specific portfolios, or changes in portfolio concentrations over time
that may affect model performance. The consideration of these items results in
adjustments to allowance amounts included in
U.S. Bancorp 17
the Company’s allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio.
Although the Company determined the amount of each element of the
allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit
management tool, the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire
loan portfolio. The actual amount of losses can vary significantly from the
estimated amounts.
At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses was $7.9 billion,
compared with an allowance of $7.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The $88
million (1.1 percent) increase in the allowance for credit losses at September 30,
2024, compared with December 31, 2023, was primarily driven by credit
migration in consumer and small business cards and portfolio growth. The
Company continued to monitor economic uncertainty related to interest rates,
inflationary pressures and other economic factors that may affect the financial
strength of corporate and consumer borrowers. The Company also continued to
monitor the commercial real estate office portfolio and has maintained an
allowance to loan coverage ratio of over 10 percent at September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023. In addition to these broad economic factors, expected loss
estimates considered various factors including customer specific information
impacting changes in risk ratings, projected delinquencies and the impact of
economic deterioration on selected borrowers’ liquidity and ability to repay.
The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 2.12
percent at September 30, 2024, compared with 2.10 percent at December 31,
2023. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was
438 percent at September 30, 2024, compared with 541 percent at
December 31, 2023. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annualized
loan net charge-offs was 353 percent at September 30, 2024, compared with
411 percent of full year 2023 net charge-offs at December 31, 2023.
The allowance for credit losses related to commercial lending segment loans
increased $24 million during the first nine months of 2024, reflecting credit
downgrades in
commercial and commercial real estate portfolios, partially offset by reduced
portfolio exposures.
The allowance for credit losses related to consumer lending segment loans
increased $64 million during the first nine months of 2024, due to credit
migration in credit card portfolios, partially offset by favorability in residential real
estate secured portfolios related to strength in home values.
Economic conditions considered in estimating the allowance for credit losses
at September 30, 2024 included changes in projected gross domestic product
and unemployment levels. These factors were evaluated through a combination
of quantitative calculations using multiple economic scenarios and additional
qualitative assessments that considered the degree of economic uncertainty in
the current environment. The projected unemployment rates for 2024
considered in the estimate ranged from 3.6 percent to 6.2 percent.
The following table summarizes the baseline forecast for key economic variables

Residual Value Risk Management The Company manages its risk to changes
in the residual value of leased vehicles, office and business equipment, and
other assets through disciplined residual valuation at the inception of a lease,
diversification of its leased assets, regular residual asset valuation reviews and
monitoring of residual value gains or losses upon the disposition of assets. As of
September 30, 2024, no significant change in the amount of residual values or
concentration of the portfolios had occurred since December 31, 2023. Refer to
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Residual Value Risk Management”
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023, for further discussion on residual value risk management.
Operational Risk Management The Company operates in many different
businesses in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees and
systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is inherent in
all business activities, and the management of this risk is important to the
achievement of the Company’s objectives. Business lines have direct and
primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling, and
monitoring operational risks embedded in their business activities, including
those additional or increased risks created by economic and financial
disruptions.
The Company maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing
proper transaction authorization and execution, proper system operations,
proper oversight of third parties with whom it does business, safeguarding of
assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability and security of financial
and other data. The Company also maintains a cybersecurity risk program which
provides centralized planning and management of related and interdependent
work with a focus on risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company's
cybersecurity risk program is integrated into the Company's overall business
and operational strategies and requires that the Company allocate appropriate
resources to maintain the program. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis — Operational Risk Management” in the Company’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for further discussion on
operational risk management.
Compliance Risk Management The Company may suffer legal or regulatory
sanctions, material financial loss, or damage to its reputation if it fails to comply
with laws, regulations, rules, standards of good practice, and codes of conduct,
including those related to compliance with Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money
laundering requirements, sanctions compliance requirements as administered
by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, consumer protection and other
requirements. The Company has controls and processes in place for the
assessment, identification, monitoring, management and reporting of
compliance risks and issues, including those created or increased by economic
and financial disruptions. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis —
Compliance Risk Management” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2023, for further discussion on compliance risk
management.
Interest Rate Risk Management In the banking industry, changes in interest
rates are a significant risk that can impact
earnings as well as the safety and soundness of an entity. The Company
manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability
management activities within guidelines established by its Asset Liability
Management Committee (“ALCO”) and approved by the Board of Directors. The
ALCO has the responsibility for approving and overseeing compliance with the
ALCO management policies, including interest rate risk exposure. One way the
Company measures and analyzes its interest rate risk is through analysis of net
interest income sensitivities across a range of scenarios.
Net interest income sensitivity analysis includes evaluating all of the
Company’s assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, inclusive of
new business activity, under various interest rate scenarios that differ in the
direction, amount and speed of change over time, as well as the overall shape
of the yield curve. The balance sheet includes assumptions regarding loan and
deposit volumes and pricing which are based on quantitative analysis, historical
trends and management outlook and strategies. Deposit balances, mix and
pricing are dynamic across interest rate scenarios and will change both with the
absolute level of rates as well as the assumed interest rate shock. Deposit
pricing changes, commonly referred to as the deposit beta, represents the
amount by which the Company’s interest-bearing deposit rates have or will
change given a change in short-term market rates. Base case and net interest
income sensitivities are reviewed monthly by the ALCO and are used to guide
asset/liability management strategies.
The Company also manages interest rate sensitivity by utilizing market value
of equity modeling, which measures the degree to which the market values of
the Company’s assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments will
change given a change in interest rates. Management measures the impact of
changes in market values due to interest rates under a number of scenarios,
including immediate and sustained parallel shifts, and flattening or steepening of
the yield curve. The Company manages its interest rate risk position by holding
assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet,
executing certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits and deploying
investment portfolio, funding and derivative strategies.
Table 9 summarizes the projected impact to net interest income over the
next 12 months of various potential interest rate changes. The sensitivity of the
projected impact to net interest income over the next 12 months is dependent on
balance sheet growth, product mix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding
decisions. From December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, interest rate
sensitivity to higher rates decreased, primarily due to deposit migration into
higher yielding products. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is relatively
neutral to further parallel upward moves in interest rates while the sensitivity to
lower rates has improved driven by the projected repricing of the deposit
portfolio in declining rate scenarios. While the Company utilizes models and
assumptions based on historical information and expected behaviors, actual
outcomes could vary significantly. For larger interest rate shock scenarios,
mortgage assets and deposits are expected to behave in a non-linear manner
resulting in varying impacts to net interest income in those scenarios.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks To manage the
sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate, prepayment, credit, price and
foreign currency fluctuations (asset and liability management positions), the
Company enters into derivative transactions. The Company uses derivatives for
asset and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways:
• To convert fixed-rate debt and available-for-sale investment securities from
fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments;
• To convert floating-rate loans and debt from floating-rate payments to fixedrate payments;
• To mitigate changes in value of the Company’s unfunded mortgage loan
commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs;
• To mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated
balances; and
• To mitigate the volatility of the Company’s net investment in foreign operations
driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In addition, the Company enters into interest rate, foreign exchange and
commodity derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its
customers (customer-related positions). The Company minimizes the market,
funding and liquidity risks of customer-related positions by either entering into
similar offsetting positions with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering
into other derivative or non-derivative financial instruments that partially or fully
offset the exposure from these customer-related positions. The Company may
enter into derivative contracts that are either exchange-traded, centrally cleared
through clearinghouses or over-the-counter. The Company does not utilize
derivatives for speculative purposes.
The Company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for
risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency of
applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value
accounting for the related hedged items. In particular, the Company enters into
interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy to-be-announced
securities (“TBAs”), U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options on U.S.
Treasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its MSRs, but does not
designate those derivatives as accounting hedges. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding MSRs,
including management of the changes in fair value.
Additionally, the Company uses forward commitments to sell TBAs and other
commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to
economically hedge the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan
production activities. The forward commitments to sell and the unfunded
mortgage loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are considered
derivatives under the accounting guidance related
to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The Company
has elected the fair value option for the MLHFS.
Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the
contracts. Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the Company
based on the probability of counterparty default. The Company manages the
credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various
counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements, and, where
possible, by requiring collateral arrangements. The Company may also transfer
counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third parties through the
use of risk participation agreements. In addition, certain interest rate swaps,
interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be centrally cleared
through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk. The
Company also mitigates the credit risk of its derivative positions, as well as the
credit risk on loans or lending portfolios, through the use of credit contracts.
For additional information on derivatives and hedging activities, refer to
Notes 12 and 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Market Risk Management In addition to interest rate risk, the Company is
exposed to other forms of market risk, principally related to trading activities
which support customers’ strategies to manage their own foreign currency,
interest rate risk, commodities risk and funding activities. For purposes of its
internal capital adequacy assessment process, the Company considers risk
arising from its trading activities, as well as the remeasurement volatility of
foreign currency denominated balances included on its Consolidated Balance
Sheet (collectively, “Covered Positions”), employing methodologies consistent
with the requirements of regulatory rules for market risk. The Company’s Market
Risk Committee (“MRC”), within the framework of the ALCO, oversees market
risk management. The MRC monitors and reviews the Company’s Covered
Positions and establishes policies for market risk management, including
exposure limits for each portfolio. The Company uses a VaR approach to
measure general market risk. Theoretically, VaR represents the statistical risk of
loss the Company has to adverse market movements over a one-day time
horizon. The Company uses the Historical Simulation method to calculate VaR
for its Covered Positions measured at the ninety-ninth percentile using a oneyear look-back period for distributions derived from past market data. The
market factors used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks
inherent in the underlying trading portfolios, principally those that affect the
Company’s corporate bond trading business, foreign currency transaction
business, client derivatives business, loan trading business and municipal
securities business, as well as those inherent in the Company’s foreign
denominated balances and the derivatives used to mitigate the related
measurement volatility. On average, the Company expects the
U.S. Bancorp 21
one-day VaR to be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year
related to these positions. The Company monitors the accuracy of internal VaR
models and modeling processes by back-testing model performance, regularly
updating the historical data used by the VaR models and regular model
validations to assess the accuracy of the models’ input, processing, and
reporting components. All models are required to be independently reviewed
and approved prior to being placed in use. If the Company were to experience
market losses in excess of the estimated VaR more often than expected, the
VaR models and associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted.
The average, high, low and period-end one-day VaR amounts for the
Company’s Covered Positions were as follows:
Nine Months Ended September 30
(Dollars in Millions) 2024 2023
Average $ 3 $ 4
High 4 7
Low 2 3
Period-end 3 3
The Company did not experience any actual losses for its combined
Covered Positions that exceeded VaR during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company stress tests its market risk
measurements to provide management with perspectives on market events that
may not be captured by its VaR models, including worst case historical market
movement combinations that have not necessarily occurred on the same date.
The Company calculates Stressed VaR using the same underlying
methodology and model as VaR, except that a historical continuous one-year
look-back period is utilized that reflects a period of significant financial stress
appropriate to the Company’s Covered Positions. The period selected by the
Company includes the significant market volatility of the last four months of
2008.
The average, high, low and period-end one-day Stressed VaR amounts for the
Company’s Covered Positions were as follows:
Nine Months Ended September 30
(Dollars in Millions) 2024 2023
Average $ 10 $ 11
High 16 16
Low 7 6
Period-end 11 7
Valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign currency activities are
based on discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques using marketbased assumptions. These valuations are compared to third-party quotes or
other market prices to determine if there are significant variances. Significant
variances are approved by senior management in the Company’s corporate
functions. Valuation of positions in the corporate bond trading, loan trading and
municipal securities businesses are based on trader marks. These trader marks
are evaluated against third-party prices, with significant variances approved by
senior management in the Company’s corporate functions.
The Company also measures the market risk of its hedging activities related
to residential MLHFS and MSRs using the Historical Simulation method. The
VaRs are measured at the
ninety-ninth percentile and employ factors pertinent to the market risks inherent
in the valuation of the assets and hedges. A one-year look-back period is used
to obtain past market data for the models.
The average, high and low VaR amounts for the residential MLHFS and related
hedges and the MSRs and related hedges were as follows:

Liquidity Risk Management The Company’s liquidity risk management process
is designed to identify, measure, and manage the Company’s funding and
liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs and to address expected and
unexpected changes in its funding requirements. The Company engages in
various activities to manage its liquidity risk. These activities include diversifying
its funding sources, stress testing, and holding readily-marketable assets which
can be used as a source of liquidity if needed. In addition, the Company’s
profitable operations, sound credit quality and strong credit ratings and capital
position have enabled it to develop a large and reliable base of core deposit
funding within its market areas and in domestic and global capital markets.
The Company’s Board of Directors approves the Company’s liquidity policy.
The Risk Management Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors
oversees the Company’s liquidity risk management process and approves a
contingency funding plan. The ALCO reviews the Company’s liquidity policy and
limits, and regularly assesses the Company’s ability to meet funding
requirements arising from adverse company-specific or market events.
The Company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress
scenarios and maintains a contingency funding plan consistent with the
Company’s access to diversified sources of contingent funding. The Company
maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance
sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include
cash at the Federal Reserve Bank and certain European central banks,
unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow from the FHLB and at the
Federal Reserve Bank’s Discount Window. Unencumbered liquid assets in the
Company’s investment securities portfolio provide asset liquidity through the
Company’s ability to sell the securities or pledge and borrow against them. Refer
to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Balance
Sheet Analysis” for further information on investment securities maturities and
trends. Asset liquidity is further enhanced by the Company’s practice of pledging
loans to
22 U.S. Bancorp
access secured borrowing facilities through the FHLB and Federal Reserve
Bank.
The following table summarizes the Company’s total available liquidity from onbalance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources:
(Dollars in Millions)

Borrowing capacity from the
Federal Reserve Bank and
FHLB 161,380 215,763
Total available liquidity $ 301,171 $ 302,386
Borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB declined from
December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 primarily due to the expiration of the
Federal Reserve Bank’s Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”). This decline
was partially offset by an increase in available investment securities as a portion
of the securities previously pledged through the BTFP were made available for
sale or pledging.
The Company’s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of
relatively stable and low-cost funding, while reducing the Company’s reliance on
the wholesale markets. Total deposits were $521.1 billion at September 30,
2024, compared with $512.3 billion at December 31, 2023. Average noninterestbearing deposit balances for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 17.0 percent
and 3.0 percent compared with the third quarter of 2023 and second quarter of
2024, respectively, reflecting the shift of noninterest-bearing balances into
interest-bearing deposit products resulting from the higher interest rate
environment. The decrease from the second quarter of 2024 reflected a slowing
shift into interest-bearing deposits as the Company continued to emphasize
relationship-based deposit generation. Average total deposits for both the third
quarter of 2024 and third quarter of 2023 funded approximately 77 percent of
the Company’s total assets for these same periods. Refer to “Balance Sheet
Analysis” for further information on the Company’s deposits.
Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-term borrowings.
Long-term debt was $54.8 billion at September 30, 2024, and is an important
funding source because of its multi-year borrowing structure. Short-term
borrowings were $23.7 billion at September 30, 2024, and supplement the
Company’s other funding sources. Refer to “Balance Sheet Analysis” for further
information on the Company’s long-term debt and short-term borrowings.
In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, the Company
monitors the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s routine funding
requirements consist primarily of operating expenses, dividends paid to
shareholders, debt service, repurchases of common stock and funds used for
acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet its obligations from
dividends collected from its subsidiaries and the issuance of debt and capital
securities. The Company establishes limits for the minimal number of months
into the future where the parent company can meet existing and forecasted
obligations with cash and securities held that can be readily monetized. The
Company
measures and manages this limit in both normal and adverse conditions. The
Company maintains sufficient funding to meet expected capital and debt service
obligations for 24 months without the support of dividends from subsidiaries and
assuming access to the wholesale markets is maintained. The Company
maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its capital and debt service obligations for
12 months under adverse conditions without the support of dividends from
subsidiaries or access to the wholesale markets. The parent company is
currently in excess of required liquidity minimums.
At September 30, 2024, parent company long-term debt outstanding was
$35.1 billion, compared with $34.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase
was primarily due to $6.1 billion of medium-term note issuances, partially offset
by $4.6 billion of medium-term note and $1.0 billion of subordinated note
repayments. As of September 30, 2024, there was no parent company debt
scheduled to mature in the remainder of 2024. Future debt maturities may be
met through medium-term note and capital security issuances and dividends
from subsidiaries, as well as from parent company cash and cash equivalents.
The Company is subject to a regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”)
requirement which requires large banking organizations to maintain an adequate
level of unencumbered high quality liquid assets to meet estimated liquidity
needs over a 30-day stressed period. For the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company’s average daily
LCR was 106.9 percent and 109.2 percent, respectively. The Company was
compliant with this requirement for both of these periods.
The Company is also subject to a regulatory Net Stable Funding Ratio
(“NSFR”) requirement which requires large banking organizations to maintain a
minimum level of stable funding based on the liquidity characteristics of their
assets, commitments, and derivative exposures over a one-year time horizon.
The Company was compliant with this requirement at September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023.
Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Liquidity Risk
Management” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023, for further discussion on liquidity risk management.
European Exposures The Company provides merchant processing and
corporate trust services in Europe either directly or through banking affiliations in
Europe. Revenue generated from sources in Europe represented approximately
3 percent of the Company’s total net revenue for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024. Operating cash for these businesses is deposited
on a short-term basis typically with certain European central banks. For deposits
placed at other European banks, exposure is mitigated by the Company placing
deposits at multiple banks and managing the amounts on deposit at any bank
based on institution-specific deposit limits. At September 30, 2024, the
Company had an aggregate amount on deposit with European banks of
approximately $7.6 billion, predominately with the Central Bank of Ireland and
Bank of England.
In addition, the Company provides financing to domestic multinational
corporations that generate revenue from customers in European countries,
transacts with various European banks as counterparties to certain derivativerelated activities, and through a subsidiary, manages money market
U.S. Bancorp 23
funds that hold certain investments in European sovereign debt. Any
deterioration in economic conditions in Europe, including the impacts resulting
from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, is not expected to have a significant effect on
the Company related to these activities.
Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Other Contractual Obligations
The Company participates in many different contractual arrangements which
may or may not be recorded on its balance sheet, with unrelated or consolidated
entities, under which the Company has an obligation to pay certain amounts,
provide credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support. These
arrangements include commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and various
forms of guarantees. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information on guarantees and contingent liabilities.
These arrangements also include any obligation related to a variable interest
held in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, credit
enhancement or market risk support. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the
Company’s interests in variable interest entities.
Capital Management The Company is committed to managing capital to
maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors and for maximum
shareholder benefit. The Company also manages its capital to exceed
regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations. To achieve its capital
goals, the Company employs a variety of capital management tools, including
dividends, common share repurchases, and the issuance of subordinated debt,
non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, common stock and other capital
instruments. The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company
follow Basel III, with the Company being subject to calculating its capital
adequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted assets under the standardized
approach. Beginning in 2022, the Company began to phase into its regulatory
capital requirements the cumulative deferred
impact of its 2020 adoption of the accounting guidance related to the impairment
of financial instruments based on the current expected credit losses (“CECL”)
methodology plus 25 percent of its quarterly credit reserve increases during
2020 and 2021. This cumulative deferred impact will continue to be phased into
the Company’s regulatory capital during 2024, culminating with a fully phased in
regulatory capital calculation beginning in 2025. Table 10 provides a summary of
statutory regulatory capital ratios in effect for the Company at September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023. All regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory “wellcapitalized” requirements.
In July 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory authorities proposed a rule to
refine the Basel III capital framework for financial institutions. The proposal
incorporates elements of the international Basel Committee’s post-crisis
reforms, including the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book to replace the
existing market risk rule, and introduces new standardized approaches for credit
risk, operational risk and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk. The proposal’s
finalization could revise the risk-based capital measures applicable to the
Company. The proposed effective date is July 1, 2025, with a three-year period
to transition the effects of the proposal.
The Company believes certain other capital ratios are useful in evaluating its
capital adequacy. The Company’s tangible common equity, as a percent of
tangible assets and as a percent of risk-weighted assets determined in
accordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements related to the CECL
methodology under the standardized approach, was 5.7 percent and 8.6
percent, respectively, at September 30, 2024, compared with 5.3 percent and
7.7 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2023. In addition, the Company’s
common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, reflecting the full
implementation of the CECL methodology, was 10.5 percent at September 30,
2024, compared with 9.7 percent at December 31, 2023. Refer to “Non-GAAP
Financial Measures” beginning on page 29 for further information on these other
capital ratios.

24 U.S. Bancorp
Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders’ equity was $58.9 billion at September 30,
2024, compared with $55.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was
primarily the result of corporate earnings and changes in unrealized gains and
losses on available-for-sale investment securities included in other
comprehensive income (loss), partially offset by dividends paid.
The Company announced on September 12, 2024 that its Board of Directors
authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of its
common stock, effective September 13, 2024. This share repurchase program
replaced the previous share repurchase program announced on December 22,
2020, which was terminated effective on September 12, 2024. Capital
distributions, including dividends and stock repurchases, are subject to the
approval of the Company’s Board of Directors and compliance with regulatory
requirements.

Line of Business Financial Review
The Company’s major lines of business are Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and
Institutional Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Payment Services, and
Treasury and Corporate Support.
Basis for Financial Presentation Business line results are derived from the
Company’s business unit profitability reporting systems by specifically attributing
managed balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related
income or expense. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information on the business lines’ basis for financial
presentation.
Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as
management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or
product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to
the Company’s diverse customer base. During 2024 and 2023, certain
organization and methodology changes were made, including revising the
Company’s line of business funds transfer-pricing methodology related to
deposits and loans during the second quarter of 2024 and combining its Wealth
Management and Investment Services and Corporate and Commercial Banking
lines of businesses to create the Wealth,
Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking line of business during the
third quarter of 2023. Prior period results were restated and presented on a
comparable basis.
Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking Wealth,
Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking provides core banking,
specialized lending, transaction and payment processing, capital markets, asset
management, and brokerage and investment related services to wealth, middle
market, large corporate, government and institutional clients. Wealth, Corporate,
Commercial and Institutional Banking contributed $1.2 billion of the Company’s
net income in the third quarter and $3.5 billion in the first nine months of 2024,
or an increase of $4 million (0.3 percent) and a decrease of $25 million (0.7
percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2023.
Net revenue decreased $12 million (0.4 percent) in the third quarter and
increased $94 million (1.0 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared
with the same periods of 2023. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent
basis, decreased $127 million (6.3 percent) in the third quarter and $173 million
(2.9 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods
of 2023, primarily due to lower noninterest-bearing deposit balances, partially
offset by the impact of higher interest rates. Noninterest income increased $115
million (11.2 percent) in the third quarter and $267 million (8.6 percent) in the
first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, primarily
due to higher commercial products revenue and trust and investment
management fees, both driven by business growth and favorable market
conditions.
Noninterest expense increased $24 million (1.8 percent) in the third quarter
of 2024, compared with the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher net
shared services expense. Noninterest expense increased $62 million (1.5
percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first nine months of
2023, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits expense.
The provision for credit losses decreased $42 million (30.9 percent) in the third
quarter of 2024, compared with the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to stable
credit quality in the current quarter. The provision for credit losses increased $64
million (23.6 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first
nine months of 2023, primarily due to higher net charge-offs, partially offset by
slower credit deterioration in the first nine months of 2024.
Consumer and Business Banking Consumer and Business Banking
comprises consumer banking, small business banking and consumer lending.
Products and services are delivered through banking offices, telephone
servicing and sales, online services, direct mail, ATM processing, mobile
devices, distributed mortgage loan officers, and intermediary relationships
including auto dealerships, mortgage banks, and strategic business partners.
Consumer and Business Banking contributed $476 million of the Company’s net
income in the third quarter and $1.4 billion in the first nine months of 2024, or
decreases of $89 million (15.8 percent) and $617 million (30.3 percent),
respectively, compared with the same periods of 2023.
Net revenue decreased $144 million (5.8 percent) in the third quarter and
$1.0 billion (12.7 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the
same periods of 2023. Net
U.S. Bancorp 25
interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, decreased $111 million (5.4
percent) in the third quarter and $993 million (14.8 percent) in the first nine
months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, due to the impact of
deposit mix and pricing. Noninterest income decreased $33 million (7.6 percent)
in the third quarter and $26 million (2.1 percent) in the first nine months of 2024,
compared with the same periods of 2023, primarily due to lower service
charges, partially offset by higher mortgage banking revenue driven by higher
gain on sale margins.
Noninterest expense decreased $36 million (2.1 percent) in the third quarter
and $269 million (5.1 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with
the same periods of 2023, primarily due to lower compensation and employee
benefits expense and net shared services expense. The provision for credit
losses increased $11 million in the third quarter and $72 million in the first nine
months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, primarily due to
higher net charge-offs.
Payment Services Payment Services includes consumer and business credit
cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate, government and purchasing
card services and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed $277
million of the Company’s net income in the third quarter and $792 million in the
first nine months of 2024, or an increase of $54 million (24.2 percent) and a
decrease of $75 million (8.7 percent), respectively, compared with the same
periods of 2023.
Net revenue increased $98 million (5.8 percent) in the third quarter and $289
million (5.8 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same
periods of 2023. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased
$64 million (9.7 percent) in the third quarter and $169 million (8.7 percent) in the
first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, primarily
due to higher loan yields driven by higher interest rates and customer revolve
rates, along with higher loan balances, partially offset by higher funding costs.
Noninterest income increased $34 million (3.3 percent) in the third quarter and
$120 million (4.0 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the
same periods of 2023, driven by higher card revenue due to favorable rates, and
higher merchant processing services revenue due to business volume growth
and favorable rates.
Noninterest expense increased $20 million (2.0 percent) in the third quarter
and $169 million (5.9 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with
the same periods of 2023, reflecting higher net shared services expense. The
provision for credit losses increased $5 million (1.3 percent) in the third quarter
and $218 million (23.4 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with
the same periods of 2023, primarily due to higher net charge-offs.
Treasury and Corporate Support Treasury and Corporate Support includes
the Company’s investment portfolios, funding, capital management, interest rate
risk management, income taxes not allocated to the business lines, including
most investments in tax-advantaged projects, and the residual aggregate of
those expenses associated with corporate activities that are managed on a
consolidated basis. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded net losses of
$226 million in the third quarter and $1.0 billion in the first nine months of
2024, compared with net losses of $448 million and $1.8 billion, respectively, in
the same periods of 2023.
Net revenue decreased $110 million (53.7 percent) in the third quarter and
$300 million (52.1 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the
same periods of 2023. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis,
increased $72 million (15.5 percent) in the third quarter of 2024, compared with
the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher yields on the investment
securities portfolio, partially offset by higher funding costs. Net interest income,
on a taxable-equivalent basis, decreased $155 million (13.3 percent) in the first
nine months of 2024, compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily due
to higher funding costs, partially offset by higher yields on the investment
securities portfolio and cash balances. Noninterest income decreased $182
million (69.7 percent) in the third quarter and $145 million (24.7 percent) in the
first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, primarily
due to higher net losses on the sales of investment securities and a decrease in
other revenue. The decrease in noninterest income in the first nine months of
2024, compared with the first nine months of 2023, was partially offset by a gain
on the sale of mortgage servicing rights during the second quarter of 2024.
Noninterest expense decreased $334 million (72.1 percent) in the third
quarter and $739 million (50.5 percent) in the first nine months of 2024,
compared with the same periods of 2023, primarily due to lower merger and
integration charges and lower other noninterest expense, partially offset by
higher higher compensation and employee benefits expense. The decrease in
noninterest expense in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first
nine months of 2023, was further offset by the impact of the FDIC special
assessment in the current year. The provision for credit losses increased $68
million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with the third quarter of 2023,
primarily due to the impact of continued economic uncertainty not allocated to
business line reserves. The provision for credit losses decreased $439 million
(83.0 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first nine
months of 2023, primarily due to balance sheet repositioning and capital
management actions in the prior year.
Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a managerial tax rate
of 25.0 percent with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the
consolidated effective tax rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company
considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and
adequacy, including:
• Tangible common equity to tangible assets,
• Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, and
• Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, reflecting the full
implementation of the CECL methodology.
These capital measures are viewed by management as useful additional
methods of evaluating the Company’s utilization of its capital held and the level
of capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic
conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors,
analysts and banking regulators to assess the Company’s capital position
relative to other financial services companies. These capital measures are not
defined in generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), or are not
currently effective or defined in banking regulations. In addition, certain of these
measures differ from currently effective capital ratios defined by banking
regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios, which are subject to
certain transitional provisions, temporarily exclude
the full impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting guidance related to
impairment of financial instruments based on the CECL methodology. As a
result, these capital measures disclosed by the Company may be considered
non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes this information helps
investors assess trends in the Company’s capital adequacy.
The Company also discloses net interest income and related ratios and
analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also be considered nonGAAP financial measures. The Company believes this presentation to be the
preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant
comparison of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.
In addition, certain performance measures utilize net interest income on a
taxable-equivalent basis, including the efficiency ratio and net interest margin.
There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a
result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial
statements and other financial information contained in this report in their
entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.
The following tables show the Company’s calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures:

Critical Accounting Policies
The accounting and reporting policies of the Company comply with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States and conform to general
practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions. The Company’s financial position and results of operations can be
affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to
understanding the Company’s financial statements. Critical accounting policies
are those policies management believes are the most important to the portrayal
of the Company’s financial condition and results, and require management to
make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most accounting
policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies.
Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical
accounting policies with the Company’s Audit Committee. Those policies
considered to be critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for credit
losses, fair value estimates, MSRs, and income taxes. These accounting
policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis —
Critical Accounting Policies” and the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023.
Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management,
including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the
Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)). Based
upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer
have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there was no change
made in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting.
