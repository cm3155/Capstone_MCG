Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

Overview 
U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) 
continued to demonstrate financial strength and stability as 
2023 financial results showcased solid fee revenue growth, 
prudent expense management, and the accretion of 
common equity tier 1 capital of 150 basis points. Disruption 
in the banking industry in early 2023 reinforced the 
Company's focus of maintaining a well-diversified business 
with an appropriate risk profile and diversified deposit base. 
During 2023, the Company continued to prudently manage 
its balance sheet by reducing its exposure to certain capital-
intensive assets and focusing on capital-efficient growth.

MUFG Union Bank Acquisition On December 1, 2022, the 
Company acquired MUFG Union Bank N.A.’s core regional 
banking franchise (“MUB”) from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial 
Group, Inc. ("MUFG"). Pursuant to the terms of the Share 
Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired all of the 
issued and outstanding shares of common stock of MUB for 
a purchase price consisting of $5.5 billion in cash and 
approximately 44 million shares of the Company’s common 
stock. The Company also received additional MUB cash of 
$3.5 billion upon completion of the acquisition, which is 
required to be repaid to MUFG on or prior to the fifth 
anniversary date of the completion of the purchase. On 
August 3, 2023, the Company completed a debt/equity 
conversion with MUFG. As a result, the Company repaid 
$936 million of its debt obligation from the proceeds of the 
issuance of 24 million shares of common stock of the 
Company to an affiliate of MUFG (the “Debt/Equity 
Conversion”). After the Debt/Equity Conversion, the 
Company had a remaining repayment obligation to MUFG of 
$2.6 billion. On May 26, 2023, the Company merged MUB 
into U.S. Bank National Association ("USBNA"), the 
Company’s primary banking subsidiary. During 2023, the 
Company successfully completed the integration of the MUB 
business and system conversion. Additionally, as a 
condition of the regulatory approval, the Company 
committed to meet requirements applicable to Category II 
banking organizations by the earlier of (i) the date required 
under the federal banking regulators' Tailoring Rules; and 
(ii) December 31, 2024, if the Federal Reserve notified the 
Company by January 1, 2024, that the Company must 
comply with those requirements. During 2023, the Company 
took several actions to optimize the balance sheet and 
reduce risk-weighted assets to enhance capital and reduce 
the risk profile of the balance sheet. As a result, on October 
16, 2023, the Federal Reserve granted the Company full 
relief from this commitment. The Company’s 2023 results 
reflect the impacts of balance sheet and capital 
management actions and the full financial results of the 
acquired business.

Financial Performance The Company earned $5.4 billion 
in 2023, or $3.27 per diluted common share, compared with 
$5.8 billion, or $3.69 per diluted common share in 2022. 

22  U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report

Financial performance for 2023, compared with 2022, 
included the following: 

• Net interest income increased $2.7 billion (18.1 percent) 
due to higher interest rates on earning assets and the 
MUB acquisition, partially offset by the impact of deposit 
mix and pricing; 

• Noninterest income increased $1.2 billion (12.3 percent) 
primarily due to higher commercial products revenue, 
payment services revenue, trust and investment 
management fees and other noninterest income, partially 
offset by losses on investment securities; 

• Noninterest expense increased $4.0 billion (26.6 percent), 
reflecting increased merger and integration charges and 
operating expenses related to the MUB acquisition, 
including core deposit intangible amortization expense, as 
well as increases in compensation and employee benefits 
expense to support business growth and higher other 
noninterest expense due to a Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation ("FDIC") special assessment; 

• The provision for credit losses increased $298 million 

(15.1 percent), driven by normalizing credit losses and 
stress in commercial real estate, partially offset by relative 
stability in the economic outlook; 

• Average loans increased $47.7 billion (14.3 percent) 

primarily driven by the impact of the MUB acquisition and 
growth in most loan categories; and 

• Average deposits increased $43.3 billion (9.4 percent), 

driven by increases in average total savings deposits and 
time deposits including the impact of the MUB acquisition, 
partially offset by a decrease in average noninterest 
bearing deposits. 

Credit Quality The Company continues to prudently 
manage credit underwriting. 

• The allowance for credit losses was $7.8 billion at 
December 31, 2023, an increase of $435 million 
compared with December 31, 2022. The increase was 
primarily driven by normalizing credit losses, credit card 
balance growth and commercial real estate credit quality. 

• Nonperforming assets were $1.5 billion at December 31, 

2023, an increase of $478 million compared with 
December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to 
higher nonperforming commercial real estate and 
commercial loans, partially offset by a decrease in 
nonperforming residential mortgages. 

• Net charge-offs were $1.9 billion in 2023, an increase of 
$842 million compared with 2022. The increase reflected 
higher charge-offs in most loan categories consistent with 
normalizing credit conditions and adverse conditions in 
commercial real estate.

Capital Management At December 31, 2023, all of the 
Company’s regulatory capital ratios exceeded regulatory 
“well-capitalized” requirements. 

• The Company’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 9.9 

percent at December 31, 2023. 

The Company's financial strength, diversified business 
model and strong credit quality position it well for 2024. The 
Company believes it is well positioned to continue to deliver 
strong returns on tangible common equity, is appropriately 
reserved for a potential macroeconomic slowdown, and 
remains confident in its strategy for future growth and 
expansion. The Company is seeing positive momentum 
across its fee-based businesses, as it deepens its most 
profitable client relationships and further executes on 
revenue growth opportunities resulting from the MUB 
acquisition. The Company is working to effectively manage 
its balance sheet for continued capital-efficient growth as it 
maintains its disciplined, through-the-cycle approach to 
credit risk management. The Company's growth strategy 
remains focused on supporting the needs of and creating 
value for its customers, communities and shareholders.

Earnings Summary The Company reported net income 
attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $5.4 billion in 2023, or $3.27 
per diluted common share, compared with $5.8 billion, or 
$3.69 per diluted common share, in 2022. Return on 
average assets and return on average common equity were 
0.82 percent and 10.8 percent, respectively, in 2023, 
compared with 0.98 percent and 12.6 percent, respectively, 
in 2022. The results for 2023 included the full financial 
results of the acquisition of MUB, while the results for 2022 
reflected one month of operating results of MUB. The results 
for 2023 included the impacts of $1.0 billion of merger and 
integration charges, $734 million of FDIC special 
assessment charges, $243 million of provision for credit 
losses related to balance sheet repositioning and capital 
management actions, $140 million of securities losses 
related to balance sheet repositioning, a $110 million 
charitable contribution to support a community benefit plan 
related to the acquisition, and a $70 million discrete tax 
benefit. Combined, these items decreased 2023 diluted 
earnings per common share by $1.04. The results for 2022 
included $399 million of losses primarily resulting from 
interest rate economic hedges related to the MUB 
acquisition, $329 million of merger and integration charges, 
and $791 million of provision for credit losses related to 
acquired loans and balance sheet repositioning and capital 
management actions. Combined, these items decreased 
2022 diluted earnings per common share by $0.76. 

Total net revenue for 2023 was $3.8 billion (15.8 percent) 

higher than 2022, reflecting an 18.1 percent increase in net 
interest income and a 12.3 percent increase in noninterest 
income. The increase in net interest income from the prior 
year was primarily due to higher interest rates on earning 
assets and the MUB acquisition, partially offset by the 
impact of deposit mix and pricing. The increase in 
noninterest income reflected higher commercial products 
revenue, payment services revenue, trust and investment 
management fees and other noninterest income, partially 
offset by losses on investment securities. 

Noninterest expense in 2023 was $4.0 billion (26.6 
percent) higher than 2022, reflecting increased merger and 
integration charges and operating expenses related to the 
MUB acquisition, including core deposit intangible 
amortization expense, as well as increases in compensation 
and employee benefits expense to support business growth 
and higher other noninterest expense due to the FDIC 
special assessment charges. 

Results for 2022 Compared With 2021 For discussion 
related to changes in financial condition and results of 
operations for 2022 compared with 2021, refer to 
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis” in the Company’s 
Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2022, 
included as Exhibit 13 to the Company’s Form 10-K filed 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on 
February 27, 2023. 

Statement of Income Analysis 

Net Interest Income Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, was $17.5 billion in 2023, compared with 
$14.8 billion in 2022. The $2.7 billion (18.1 percent) 
increase in 2023 compared with 2022 was primarily due to 
higher interest rates on earning assets and the acquisition of 
MUB, partially offset by the impact of deposit mix and 
pricing. Average earning assets were $59.9 billion (11.0 
percent) higher in 2023, compared with 2022, reflecting 
increases in loans and interest-bearing deposits with banks, 
partially offset by a decrease in investment securities. The 
net interest margin, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in 2023 
was 2.90 percent, compared with 2.72 percent in 2022. The 
increase in the net interest margin in 2023, compared with 
2022, was primarily due to the impact of higher rates on 
earning assets and the acquisition of MUB, partially offset 
by the impact of deposit mix and pricing. Refer to the 
“Interest Rate Risk Management” section for further 
information on the sensitivity of the Company’s net interest 
income to changes in interest rates.

Average total loans were $381.3 billion in 2023, 

compared with $333.6 billion in 2022. The $47.7 billion (14.3 
percent) increase was due to growth in the Company's 
legacy loan portfolio as well as balances from the MUB 
acquisition. Increases in residential mortgages, commercial 
real estate loans, commercial loans and credit card loans 
were partially offset by a decrease in other retail loans. 
Average residential mortgages increased $31.2 billion (36.8 
percent), driven by the impact of the MUB acquisition, 
partially offset by the impact of a sale of residential 
mortgages in the second quarter of 2023 as part of balance 
sheet repositioning and capital management actions. 
Average commercial real estate loans increased $13.5 
billion (33.0 percent), primarily due to the impact of the MUB 
acquisition. Average commercial loans increased $11.1 
billion (9.0 percent), primarily due to higher utilization driven 
by working capital needs of corporate customers, slower 
payoffs given higher volatility in the capital markets, as well 
as core growth and the impact related to the MUB 
acquisition. Average credit card loans increased $3.1 billion 
(13.2 percent) primarily due to higher spend volume and 
lower payment rates. Average other retail loans decreased 
$11.2 billion (18.5 percent), driven by lower auto loans 

primarily due to balance sheet repositioning and capital 
management actions, along with lower installment loans.

Average investment securities in 2023 were $6.7 billion 

(3.9 percent) lower than in 2022, primarily due to balance 
sheet repositioning and liquidity management. 

Average total deposits for 2023 were $43.3 billion (9.4 
percent) higher than 2022. Average total savings deposits 
were $39.8 billion (12.8 percent) higher in 2023, compared 
with 2022, driven by increases in Wealth, Corporate, 
Commercial and Institutional Banking, and Consumer and 
Business Banking balances, including the impact of the 
MUB acquisition. Average time deposits for 2023 were 
$16.1 billion (52.7 percent) higher than 2022, mainly due to 
the acquisition of MUB and increases in Consumer and 
Business Banking balances. Changes in time deposits are 
primarily related to those deposits managed as an 
alternative to other funding sources, based largely on 
relative pricing and liquidity characteristics. Average 
noninterest-bearing deposits were $12.6 billion (10.5 
percent) lower in 2023, compared with 2022, driven by 
decreases in Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and 
Institutional Banking balances, partially offset by the impact 
of the MUB acquisition.

(a) This table shows the components of the change in net interest income by volume and rate on a taxable-equivalent basis based on a federal income tax rate of 21 percent. This 

table does not take into account the level of noninterest-bearing funding, nor does it fully reflect changes in the mix of assets and liabilities. The change in interest not solely due to 
changes in volume or rates has been allocated on a pro-rata basis to volume and yield/rate.

Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses 
reflects changes in economic conditions and the size and 
credit quality of the entire portfolio of loans. The Company 
maintains an allowance for credit losses considered 
appropriate by management for expected losses, based on 
factors discussed in the “Analysis and Determination of 
Allowance for Credit Losses” section. 

The provision for credit losses was $2.3 billion in 2023, 
compared with $2.0 billion in 2022. The $298 million (15.1 
percent) increase was driven by normalizing credit losses 
and stress in commercial real estate, partially offset by 
relative stability in the economic outlook. The provision for 
credit losses in 2023 included the impact of balance sheet 
repositioning and capital management actions taken in the 
second quarter of 2023. The provision for credit losses in 

2022 included the impacts of recognizing an initial provision 
for credit losses related to the MUB acquisition and balance 
sheet optimization activities in the fourth quarter of 2022, 
along with strong loan growth in the legacy portfolio and 
increasing economic uncertainty. Net charge-offs increased 
$842 million (79.2 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, 
reflecting higher charge-offs in most loan categories 
consistent with normalizing credit conditions and adverse 
conditions in commercial real estate. 

Refer to “Corporate Risk Profile” for further information 

on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, 
nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the 
Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
and establishing the allowance for credit losses.

Noninterest Income Noninterest income in 2023 was $10.6 
billion, compared with $9.5 billion in 2022. The $1.2 billion 
(12.3 percent) increase in 2023 from 2022 reflected higher 
commercial products revenue, payment services revenue, 
trust and investment management fees and other 
noninterest income, partially offset by losses on the sale of 
investment securities related to balance sheet repositioning. 
Commercial products revenue increased 24.2 percent

with 2022, driven by a 7.8 percent increase in card revenue 
and a 5.1 percent increase in merchant processing services 
revenue, both due to higher spend volume. Corporate 
payment products revenue increased 8.7 percent due to 
product mix. Trust and investment management fees 
increased 11.3 percent primarily due to the acquisition of 
MUB and core business growth. Other noninterest income 
was higher in 2023, compared with 2022, primarily due to 
the impact in 2022 of interest rate economic hedges related 
to the MUB acquisition.

Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense in 2023 was 
$18.9 billion, compared with $14.9 billion in 2022. The 
Company’s efficiency ratio was 66.7 percent in 2023, 
compared with 61.4 percent in 2022. The $4.0 billion (26.6 
percent) increase in noninterest expense in 2023 over 2022 
reflected the impact of increased merger and integration 
charges, as well as operating expenses related to the MUB 
acquisition, higher compensation and employee benefits 
expense, and higher other intangibles and other noninterest 
expense. Compensation and employee benefits expense 
increased 13.7 percent in 2023 over 2022, primarily due to 
MUB expense as well as merit increases and hiring to 
support business growth. Other intangibles expense 
increased primarily due to the core deposit intangible 
created as a result of the MUB acquisition. Other 
noninterest expense increased 58.2 percent primarily due to 
the $734 million FDIC special assessment charge. 

Income Tax Expense The provision for income taxes was 
$1.4 billion (an effective rate of 20.5 percent) in 2023, 
compared with $1.5 billion (an effective rate of 20.0 percent) 
in 2022. 

For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 19 

of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Balance Sheet Analysis 

Average earning assets were $605.2 billion in 2023, 
compared with $545.3 billion in 2022. The increase in 
average earning assets of $59.9 billion (11.0 percent) was 
primarily due to increases in loans of $47.7 billion (14.3 
percent) and interest-bearing deposits with banks of $17.6 
billion (55.9 percent), partially offset by a decrease in 
investment securities of $6.7 billion (3.9 percent). 

For average balance information, refer to the "Net 
Interest Income" section in Statement of Income Analysis 
and Consolidated Daily Average Balance Sheet and Related 
Yields and Rates on page 138. 

Loans The Company’s loan portfolio was $373.8 billion at 
December 31, 2023, compared with $388.2 billion at 
December 31, 2022, a decrease of $14.4 billion (3.7 
percent). The decrease was driven by decreases in other 
retail loans of $10.5 billion (19.1 percent), commercial loans 
of $3.8 billion (2.8 percent), commercial real estate loans of 
$2.0 billion (3.7 percent) and residential mortgages of $315 
million (0.3 percent), partially offset by an increase in credit 
card loans of $2.3 billion (8.6 percent). Table 6 provides a 
summary of the loan distribution by product type, while 
Table 7 provides a summary of the selected loan maturity 
distribution by loan category.

Commercial Real Estate The Company’s portfolio of 
commercial real estate loans, which includes commercial 
mortgages and construction and development loans, 
decreased $2.0 billion (3.7 percent) at December 31, 2023, 
compared with December 31, 2022. The decrease was 
primarily due to payoffs exceeding a reduced level of new 
originations. Table 9 provides a summary of commercial real

Other Retail Total other retail loans, which include retail 
leasing, home equity and second mortgages and other retail 
loans, decreased $10.5 billion (19.1 percent) at 
December 31, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, 
driven by decreases in auto loans, retail leasing balances 
and installment loans. The decrease in auto loans was 
primarily driven by a sale of indirect auto loans as part of 
balance sheet repositioning and capital management 
actions taken in the second quarter of 2023. Tables 10, 11 
and 12 provide a geographic summary of residential 
mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans

Residential Mortgages Residential mortgages held in the 
loan portfolio at December 31, 2023, decreased $315 million 
(0.3 percent) compared to December 31, 2022, driven by a 
sale of residential mortgages in the second quarter of 2023 
as part of balance sheet repositioning and capital 
management actions, partially offset by originations. 
Residential mortgages originated and placed in the 
Company’s loan portfolio include jumbo mortgages and 
branch-originated first lien home equity loans to borrowers 
with high credit quality. 

Credit Card Total credit card loans increased $2.3 billion 
(8.6 percent) at December 31, 2023, compared with 
December 31, 2022, primarily driven by higher spend 
volume and lower payment rates.

The Company generally retains portfolio loans through 
maturity; however, the Company’s intent may change over 
time based upon various factors such as ongoing asset/
liability management activities, assessment of product 
profitability, credit risk, liquidity needs, and capital 
implications. If the Company’s intent or ability to hold an 
existing portfolio loan changes, it is transferred to loans held 
for sale.

Investment Securities The Company uses its investment 
securities portfolio to manage interest rate risk, provide 
liquidity (including the ability to meet regulatory 
requirements), generate interest and dividend income, and 
as collateral for public deposits and wholesale funding 
sources. While the Company intends to hold its investment 
securities indefinitely, it may sell available-for-sale 
investment securities in response to structural changes in 
the balance sheet and related interest rate risk and to meet 
liquidity requirements, among other factors. 

Investment securities totaled $153.8 billion at 
December 31, 2023, compared with $161.7 billion at 
December 31, 2022. The $7.9 billion (4.9 percent) decrease 
was primarily due to $10.5 billion of net investment sales 
and maturities, partially offset by a $1.6 billion favorable 
change in net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale 
investment securities. Investment securities by type are 
shown in Table 13. 

The Company’s available-for-sale investment securities 
are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected 
in other comprehensive income (loss) unless a portion of a 
security’s unrealized loss is related to credit and an 
allowance for credit losses is necessary. At December 31, 
2023, the Company’s net unrealized losses on available-for-
sale investment securities were $6.9 billion ($5.2 billion net-
of-tax), compared with net unrealized losses of $8.5 billion 
($6.4 billion net-of-tax) at December 31, 2022. The 
favorable change in net unrealized gains (losses) was 
primarily due to increases in the fair value of mortgage-
backed, U.S. Treasury and agencies and state and political 
subdivisions securities as a result of changes in interest 
rates. Gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale 
investment securities totaled $7.1 billion at December 31, 
2023, compared with $8.6 billion at December 31, 2022. 
When evaluating credit losses, the Company considers 
various factors such as the nature of the investment 
security, the credit ratings or financial condition of the 
issuer, the extent of the unrealized loss, expected cash 
flows of the underlying collateral, the existence of any 
government or agency guarantees, and market conditions. 

At December 31, 2023, the Company had no plans to sell 
securities with unrealized losses, and believes it is more 
likely than not that it would not be required to sell such 
securities before recovery of their amortized cost. 

Refer to Notes 5 and 22 in the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements for further information on investment 
securities. 

Deposits Total deposits were $512.3 billion at 
December 31, 2023, compared with $525.0 billion at 
December 31, 2022. The $12.7 billion (2.4 percent) 
decrease in total deposits reflected a decrease in 
noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by increases in 
time deposits and total savings deposits. 

Noninterest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2023, 
decreased $47.8 billion (34.7 percent) from December 31, 
2022. The decrease was driven by lower Wealth, Corporate, 
Commercial and Institutional Banking, and Consumer and 
Business Banking balances. 

Time deposits at December 31, 2023, increased $19.3 
billion (58.7 percent), compared with December 31, 2022, 
driven by higher Consumer and Business Banking balances. 
Changes in time deposits are primarily related to those 
deposits managed as an alternative to other funding 
sources, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity 
characteristics.

Interest-bearing savings deposits increased $15.8 billion 

(4.4 percent) at December 31, 2023, compared with 
December 31, 2022. The increase was related to higher 
money market deposit balances, partially offset by lower 
savings account and interest checking deposit balances. 
Money market deposit balances increased $51.4 billion 
(34.7 percent), primarily due to higher Consumer and 
Business Banking, and Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and 
Institutional Banking balances. Savings account balances 
decreased $28.6 billion (39.8 percent), driven by lower 
Consumer and Business Banking balances. Interest 
checking balances decreased $7.0 billion (5.2 percent) 
primarily due to lower Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and 
Institutional Banking balances.

Borrowings The Company utilizes both short-term and 
long-term borrowings as part of its asset/liability 
management and funding strategies. Short-term borrowings, 
which include federal funds purchased, commercial paper, 
repurchase agreements, borrowings secured by high-grade 
assets and other short-term borrowings, were $15.3 billion 
at December 31, 2023, compared with $31.2 billion at 
December 31, 2022. The $15.9 billion (51.1 percent) 
decrease in short-term borrowings at December 31, 2023, 
compared with December 31, 2022, was primarily due to 
decreases in short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) 
advances. 

Long-term debt was $51.5 billion at December 31, 2023, 

compared with $39.8 billion at December 31, 2022. The 
$11.7 billion (29.3 percent) increase was primarily due to 
$8.2 billion of medium-term note issuances, a $7.1 billion 
increase in FHLB advances, partially offset by $2.8 billion of 
bank note repayments and maturities and a $936 million 
repayment of the Company's debt obligation to MUFG. 

Refer to Notes 13 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements for additional information regarding 
short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and the “Liquidity

Corporate Risk Profile 

Overview Managing risks is an essential part of 
successfully operating a financial services company. The 
Company’s Board of Directors has approved a risk 
management framework which establishes governance and 
risk management requirements for all risk-taking activities. 
This framework includes Company and business line risk 
appetite statements which set boundaries for the types and 
amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business 
objectives and initiatives. The Board of Directors, primarily 
through its Risk Management Committee, oversees 
performance relative to the risk management framework, 
risk appetite statements, and other policy requirements. 

The Executive Risk Committee (“ERC”), which is chaired 

by the Chief Risk Officer and includes the Chief Executive 
Officer and other members of the executive management 
team, oversees execution against the risk management 
framework and risk appetite statements. The ERC focuses 
on current and emerging risks, including strategic and 
reputation risks, by directing timely and comprehensive 
actions. Senior operating committees have also been 
established, each responsible for overseeing a specified 
category of risk. 

Upon closing of the MUB acquisition, the Company’s risk 

management framework applied to the legal entities 

35

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
acquired from MUFG, including MUB, up until its merger into 
USBNA. Updates were made to align the acquired entities 
with the Company’s risk appetite and connect the elements 
of their respective risk governance and reporting into the 
Company’s existing risk management framework. Upon 
completing the merger of MUB into USBNA, which occurred 
on May 26, 2023, the MUB risk governance and reporting 
framework is no longer applicable. 

The Company’s most prominent risk exposures are 

credit, interest rate, market, liquidity, operational, 
compliance, strategic, and reputation. Credit risk is the risk 
of loss associated with a change in the credit profile or the 
failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its contractual 
obligations. Interest rate risk is the current or prospective 
risk to earnings and capital, or market valuations, arising 
from the impact of changes in interest rates. Market risk 
arises from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange 
rates, and security prices that may result in changes in the 
values of financial instruments, such as trading and 
available-for-sale investment securities, mortgage loans 
held for sale (“MLHFS”), mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") 
and derivatives that are accounted for on a fair value basis. 
Liquidity risk is the risk that financial condition or overall 
safety and soundness is adversely affected by the 
Company’s inability, or perceived inability, to meet its cash 
flow obligations in a timely and complete manner in either 
normal or stressed conditions. Operational risk is the risk to 
current or projected financial condition and resilience arising 
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, 
people (including human errors or misconduct), or adverse 
external events, including the risk of loss resulting from 
breaches in data security. Operational risk can also include 
the risk of loss due to failures by third parties with which the 
Company does business. Compliance risk is the risk that the 
Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, financial 
losses, and reputational damage if it fails to adhere to 
compliance requirements and the Company’s compliance 
policies. Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected 
financial condition and resilience arising from adverse 
business decisions, poor implementation of business 
decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the 
banking industry and operating environment. Reputation risk 
is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or 
franchise or enterprise value arising from negative public 
opinion. This risk may impair the Company’s 
competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish new 
relationships or services, or continue serving existing 
relationships. In addition to the risks identified above, other 
risk factors exist that may impact the Company. Refer to 
“Risk Factors” beginning on page 140 for a detailed 
discussion of these factors. 

The Company’s Board and management-level 

governance committees are supported by a “three lines of 
defense” model for establishing effective checks and 
balances. The first line of defense, the business lines, 
manages risks in conformity with established limits and 
policy requirements. In turn, business line leaders and their 
risk officers establish programs to ensure conformity with 
these limits and policy requirements. The second line of 
defense, which includes the Chief Risk Officer’s 
organization as well as policy and oversight activities of 

36  U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report

corporate support functions, translates risk appetite and 
strategy into actionable risk limits and policies. The second 
line of defense monitors first line of defense conformity with 
limits and policies, and provides reporting and escalation of 
emerging risks and other concerns to senior management 
and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of 
Directors. The third line of defense, internal audit, is 
responsible for providing the Audit Committee of the Board 
of Directors and senior management with independent 
assessment and assurance regarding the effectiveness of 
the Company’s governance, risk management and control 
processes. 

Management regularly provides reports to the Risk 

Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk 
Management Committee discusses with management the 
Company’s risk management performance, and provides a 
summary of key risks to the entire Board of Directors, 
covering the status of existing matters, areas of potential 
future concern and specific information on certain types of 
loss events. The Risk Management Committee considers 
quarterly reports by management assessing the Company’s 
performance relative to the risk appetite statements and the 
associated risk limits, including: 

• Macroeconomic environment and other qualitative 
considerations, such as regulatory and compliance 
changes, litigation developments, geopolitical events, and 
technology and cybersecurity; 

• Credit measures, including adversely rated and 

nonperforming loans, leveraged transactions, credit 
concentrations and lending limits; 

•

Interest rate and market risk, including market value and 
net income simulation, and trading-related Value at Risk 
(“VaR”); 

• Liquidity risk, including funding projections under various 

stressed scenarios; 

• Operational and compliance risk, including losses 

stemming from events such as fraud, processing errors, 
control breaches, breaches in data security or adverse 
business decisions, as well as reporting on technology 
performance, and various legal and regulatory 
compliance measures;  

• Capital ratios and projections, including regulatory 

measures and stressed scenarios; and 

• Strategic and reputation risk considerations, impacts and 

responses. 

Credit Risk Management The Company’s strategy for 
credit risk management includes well-defined, centralized 
credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing 
risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and 
consumer credit exposures. The strategy also emphasizes 
diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, 
regular credit examinations and management reviews of 
loans exhibiting deterioration of credit quality. The Risk 
Management Committee oversees the Company’s credit 
risk management process. 

In addition, credit quality ratings, as defined by the 
Company, are an important part of the Company’s overall 
credit risk management and evaluation of its allowance for 

credit losses. Loans with a pass rating represent those 
loans not classified on the Company’s rating scale for 
problem credits, as minimal credit risk has been identified. 
Loans with a special mention or classified rating, including 
consumer lending and small business loans that are 90 
days or more past due and still accruing, nonaccrual loans 
and loans in a junior lien position that are current but are 
behind a first lien position on nonaccrual, encompass all 
loans held by the Company that it considers to have a 
potential or well-defined weakness that may put full 
collection of contractual cash flows at risk. The Company’s 
internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are 
primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming status, 
except for a limited population of larger loans within those 
portfolios that are individually evaluated. For this limited 
population, the determination of the internal credit quality 
rating may also consider collateral value and customer cash 
flows. Refer to Notes 1 and 6 in the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements for further discussion of the 
Company’s loan portfolios including internal credit quality 
ratings. 

The Company categorizes its loan portfolio into two 

segments, which is the level at which it develops and 
documents a systematic methodology to determine the 
allowance for credit losses. The Company’s two loan 
portfolio segments are commercial lending and consumer 
lending. 

The commercial lending segment includes loans and 

leases made to small business, middle market, large 
corporate, commercial real estate, financial institution, non-
profit and public sector customers. Key risk characteristics 
relevant to commercial lending segment loans include the 
industry and geography of the borrower’s business, purpose 
of the loan, repayment source, borrower’s debt capacity and 
financial flexibility, loan covenants, and nature of pledged 
collateral, if any, as well as macroeconomic factors such as 
unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels, 
corporate bond spreads and long-term interest rates. These 
risk characteristics, among others, are considered in 
determining estimates about the likelihood of default by the 
borrowers and the severity of loss in the event of default. 
The Company considers these risk characteristics in 
assigning internal risk ratings to, or forecasting losses on, 
these loans, which are the significant factors in determining 
the allowance for credit losses for loans in the commercial 
lending segment. 

The consumer lending segment represents loans and 
leases made to consumer customers, including residential 
mortgages, credit card loans, and other retail loans such as 
revolving consumer lines, auto loans and leases and home 
equity loans and lines. Home equity or second mortgage 
loans are junior lien closed-end accounts fully disbursed at 
origination. These loans typically are fixed rate loans, 
secured by residential real estate, with a 10- or 15-year 
fixed payment amortization schedule. Home equity lines are 
revolving accounts giving the borrower the ability to draw 
and repay balances repeatedly, up to a maximum 
commitment, and are secured by residential real estate. 
These include accounts in either a first or junior lien 
position. Typical terms on home equity lines in the portfolio 
are variable rates benchmarked to the prime rate, with a 10-

year draw period during which a minimum payment is 
equivalent to the monthly interest, followed by a 20-year 
amortization period. At December 31, 2023, substantially all 
of the Company’s home equity lines were in the draw 
period. Key risk characteristics relevant to consumer lending 
segment loans primarily relate to the borrowers’ capacity 
and willingness to repay and include unemployment rates, 
consumer bankruptcy filings and other macroeconomic 
factors, customer payment history and credit scores, and in 
some cases, updated loan-to-value (“LTV”) information 
reflecting current market conditions on real estate-based 
loans. These and other risk characteristics are reflected in 
forecasts of delinquency levels, bankruptcies and losses 
which are the primary factors in determining the allowance 
for credit losses for the consumer lending segment. 

The Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio 
segments into various classes based on their underlying risk 
characteristics. The two classes within the commercial 
lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real 
estate loans. The three classes within the consumer lending 
segment are residential mortgages, credit card loans and 
other retail loans. 

Because business processes and credit risks associated 
with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same 
as for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to 
estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments. The 
Company also engages in non-lending activities that may 
give rise to credit risk, including derivative transactions for 
balance sheet hedging purposes, foreign exchange 
transactions, deposit overdrafts and interest rate contracts 
for customers, investments in securities and other financial 
assets, and settlement risk, including Automated Clearing 
House transactions and the processing of credit card 
transactions for merchants. These activities are subject to 
credit review, analysis and approval processes. 

Economic and Other Factors In evaluating its credit risk, 
the Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting 
activities, the loan portfolio composition (including product 
mix and geographic, industry or customer-specific 
concentrations), collateral values, trends in loan 
performance and macroeconomic factors, such as changes 
in unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels, 
inflation, interest rates and consumer bankruptcy filings. 

During 2023, economic uncertainty and recession risk 

stabilized as inflation began to subside. Borrowers 
continued to experience the lagged impact of elevated 
interest rates on earnings potential. In addition to these 
broad economic factors, expected loss estimates consider 
various factors including customer specific information 
impacting changes in risk ratings, projected delinquencies 
and the impact of economic deterioration on selected 
borrowers’ liquidity and ability to repay.

Credit Diversification The Company manages its credit 
risk, in part, through diversification of its loan portfolio which 
is achieved through limit setting by product type criteria, 
such as industry, and identification of credit concentrations. 
As part of its normal business activities, the Company offers 
a broad array of traditional commercial lending products and 
specialized products such as asset-based lending, 
commercial lease financing, agricultural credit, warehouse

Residential mortgage originations are generally limited to 
prime borrowers and are performed through the Company’s 
branches, loan production offices, mobile and online 
services, and a wholesale network of originators. The 
Company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates 
on its balance sheet or sell the loans into the secondary 
market while retaining the servicing rights and customer 
relationships. Utilizing the secondary markets enables the 
Company to effectively reduce its credit and other asset/
liability risks. For residential mortgages that are retained in 
the Company’s portfolio and for home equity and second 
mortgages, credit risk is managed by adherence to LTV and 
borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process. 

The Company estimates updated LTV information on its 

outstanding residential mortgages quarterly, based on a 
method that combines automated valuation model updates 
and relevant home price indices. LTV is the ratio of the 
loan’s outstanding principal balance to the current estimate 
of property value. For home equity and second mortgages, 
combined loan-to-value (“CLTV”) is the combination of the 
first mortgage original principal balance and the second lien 
outstanding principal balance, relative to the current 
estimate of property value. Certain loans do not have an 
LTV or CLTV, primarily due to lack of availability of relevant 
automated valuation model and/or home price indices 
values, or lack of necessary valuation data on acquired 
loans. 

The following tables provide summary information of 
residential mortgages and home equity and second 
mortgages by LTV at December 31, 2023:

mortgage lending, small business lending, commercial real 
estate lending, health care lending and correspondent 
banking financing. The Company also offers an array of 
consumer lending products, including residential mortgages, 
credit card loans, auto loans, retail leases, home equity 
loans and lines, revolving credit arrangements and other 
consumer loans. These consumer lending products are 
primarily offered through the branch office network, home 
mortgage and loan production offices, mobile and online 
banking, and indirect distribution channels, such as auto 
and recreational vehicle dealers. The Company monitors 
and manages the portfolio diversification by industry, 
customer and geography. The Company has significant loan 
exposure within California given its strategic position in 
those markets and size of the economy. Table 6 provides 
information with respect to the overall product diversification 
and changes in the mix during 2023. 

The commercial loan class is diversified among various 
industries with higher concentrations in financial institutions 
and real estate. Table 8 provides a summary of significant 
industry groups and geographical locations of commercial 
loans outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

The commercial real estate loan class reflects the 

Company’s focus on serving business owners within its local 
network, as well as regional and national investment-based 
real estate owners and developers. Within the commercial 
real estate loan class, different property types have varying 
degrees of credit risk. Table 9 provides a summary of the 
significant property types and geographical locations of 
commercial real estate loans outstanding at December 31, 
2023 and 2022. Commercial real estate loans are diversified 
among various property types with higher concentrations in 
multi-family, business owner-occupied and office properties. 
The commercial real estate office sector, which represented 
13.0 percent of commercial real estate loans and 1.9 
percent of total loans at December 31, 2023, is driving 
stress in this sector. The Company believes it has prudently 
monitored this portfolio and established an allowance to 
loan coverage ratio of approximately 10 percent as of 
December 31, 2023. Office nonperforming loans 
represented 7.6 percent of total office loans at December 
31, 2023. The Company's commercial real estate multi-
family portfolio is underwritten on the basis of current in 
place cash flows without consideration to any potential net 
benefits of the ability to convert rent-stabilized units to 
market rate. The Company's exposure to rent-stabilized 
properties in the New York City market is de minimis.

The Company’s consumer lending segment utilizes 

several distinct business processes and channels to 
originate consumer credit, including traditional branch 
lending, mobile and online banking, indirect lending, alliance 
partnerships and correspondent banks. Each distinct 
underwriting and origination activity manages unique credit 
risk characteristics and prices its loan production 
commensurate with the differing risk profiles.

See the “Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for 
Credit Losses” section for additional information on how the 
Company determines the allowance for credit losses for 
loans in a junior lien position. 

Credit card and other retail loans are diversified across 
customer segments and geographies. Diversification in the 
credit card portfolio is achieved with broad customer 
relationship distribution through the Company’s and financial 
institution partners’ branches, retail and affinity partners, 
and digital channels. 

Tables 10, 11 and 12 provide a geographical summary of

Home equity and second mortgages were $13.1 billion at 

December 31, 2023, compared with $12.9 billion at 
December 31, 2022, and included $2.6 billion of home 
equity lines in a first lien position and $10.5 billion of home 
equity and second mortgage loans and lines in a junior lien 
position. Loans and lines in a junior lien position at 
December 31, 2023, included approximately $3.1 billion of 
loans and lines for which the Company also serviced the 
related first lien loan, and approximately $7.4 billion where 
the Company did not service the related first lien loan. The 
Company was able to determine the status of the related 
first liens using information the Company has as the servicer 
of the first lien or information reported on customer credit 
bureau files. The Company also evaluates other indicators 
of credit risk for these junior lien loans and lines, including 
delinquency, estimated average CLTV ratios and updated 
weighted-average credit scores in making its assessment of 
credit risk, related loss estimates and determining the 
allowance for credit losses.

(a) Delinquent loan ratios exclude $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of loans purchased and loans that could be purchased from GNMA 

mortgage pools under delinquent loan repurchase options whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States 
Department of Veterans Affairs. Including these loans, the ratio of residential mortgages 90 days or more past due and nonperforming to total residential mortgages was 2.00 
percent and 2.28 percent at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Accruing loans 90 days or more past due totaled $698 
million at December 31, 2023, compared with $491 million 
at December 31, 2022. Accruing loans 90 days or more past 
due are not included in nonperforming assets and continue 
to accrue interest because they are adequately secured by 
collateral, are in the process of collection and are 
reasonably expected to result in repayment or restoration to 
current status, or are managed in homogeneous portfolios 
with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory 
guidelines. The ratio of accruing loans 90 days or more past 
due to total loans was 0.19 percent at December 31, 2023, 
compared with 0.13 percent at December 31, 2022. 

Loan Delinquencies Trends in delinquency ratios are an 
indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within 
the Company’s loan portfolios. The entire balance of a loan 
account is considered delinquent if the minimum payment 
contractually required to be made is not received by the 
date specified on the billing statement. Delinquent loans 
purchased and loans that could be purchased from GNMA 
mortgage pools under delinquent loan repurchase options 
whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal 
Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States 
Department of Veterans Affairs, are excluded from 
delinquency statistics. In addition, in certain situations, a 
consumer lending customer’s account may be re-aged to 
remove it from delinquent status. Generally, the purpose of 
re-aging accounts is to assist customers who have recently 
overcome temporary financial difficulties and have 
demonstrated both the ability and willingness to resume 
regular payments. In addition, the Company may re-age the 
consumer lending account of a customer who has 
experienced longer-term financial difficulties and apply 
modified, concessionary terms and conditions to the 
account. Commercial lending loans are generally not subject 
to re-aging policies.

options that continue to accrue interest, compared with $647 million and $2.2

(b) Includes revolving credit, installment and automobile loans. 

Modified Loans In certain circumstances, the Company 
may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of 
amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial 
difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the 
near-term. In most cases the modification is either a 
concessionary reduction in interest rate, extension of the 
maturity date or reduction in the principal balance that would 
otherwise not be considered. 

Modified loans accrue interest if the borrower complies 
with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated 
repayment performance at a level commensurate with the 
modified terms over several payment cycles, which is 
generally six months or greater.

The Company continues to work with customers to 
modify loans for borrowers who are experiencing financial 
difficulties. Many of the Company’s loan modifications are 
determined on a case-by-case basis in connection with 
ongoing loan collection processes. The modifications vary 
within each of the Company’s loan classes. Commercial 
lending segment modifications generally include extensions 
of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an 
increase or decrease to the interest rate. The Company may 
also work with the borrower to make other changes to the 
loan to mitigate losses, such as obtaining additional 
collateral and/or guarantees to support the loan. 

The Company has also implemented certain residential 

mortgage loan modification programs. The Company 
modifies residential mortgage loans under Federal Housing 
Administration, United States Department of Veterans 
Affairs, and its own internal programs. Under these 
programs, the Company offers qualifying homeowners the 
opportunity to permanently modify their loan and achieve 
more affordable monthly payments. These modifications 
may include adjustments to interest rates, conversion of 
adjustable rates to fixed rates, extensions of maturity dates 
or deferrals of payments, capitalization of accrued interest 
and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations, partial 
forgiveness of loan principal. In most instances, participation 
in residential mortgage loan modification programs requires 
the customer to complete a short-term trial period. A 
permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer 
successfully completing the trial period arrangement, and 
the loan documents are not modified until that time. 

Credit card and other retail loan modifications are 
generally part of distinct modification programs providing 
customers modification solutions over a specified time 
period, generally up to 60 months. 

limited circumstances, to assist borrowers experiencing 
temporary hardships, including previously offering payment 
relief to borrowers that experienced financial hardship 
resulting directly from the effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Short-term consumer lending modification 
programs include payment reductions, deferrals of up to 
three past due payments, and the ability to return to current 
status if the borrower makes required payments. The 
Company may also make short-term modifications to 
commercial lending loans, with the most common 
modification being an extension of the maturity date of three 
months or less. Such extensions generally are used when 
the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is 
experiencing some level of financial stress, but the 
Company believes the borrower will pay all contractual 
amounts owed. 

Nonperforming Assets The level of nonperforming assets 
represents another indicator of the potential for future credit 
losses. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, 
modified loans not performing in accordance with modified 
terms and not accruing interest, modified loans that have 
not met the performance period required to return to accrual 
status, other real estate owned (“OREO”) and other 
nonperforming assets owned by the Company. Interest 
payments collected from assets on nonaccrual status are 
generally applied against the principal balance and not

nonperforming assets, from December 31, 2022 to

nonperforming commercial real estate and commercial

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-offs Total loan net 
charge-offs were $1.9 billion in 2023, compared with $1.1 
billion in 2022. The $842 million (79.2 percent) increase in 
total net charge-offs in 2023, compared with 2022, reflected 
higher charge-offs in most loan categories consistent with 
normalizing credit conditions and adverse conditions in 
commercial real estate, along with the impacts of balance 
sheet repositioning and capital management actions in 2023 
and 2022. Net charge-offs in 2023 included charge-offs 
related to balance sheet repositioning and capital 
management actions taken in the second quarter of 2023, 
along with charge-offs in the first quarter of 2023 related to 
the uncollectible amount of acquired loans, which were 
considered purchased credit deteriorated as of the date of 
the MUB acquisition. Net charge-offs in 2022 included 
charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to 
uncollectible amounts on acquired loans and balance sheet 
optimization activities. The ratio of total loan net charge-offs 
to average loans outstanding was 0.50 percent in 2023, 
compared with 0.32 percent in 2022. Excluding the impact 
of charge-offs related to the MUB acquisition and balance 
sheet repositioning and capital management actions, the 
ratio of total loan net charge-offs to average loans 
outstanding was 0.39 percent in 2023, compared with 0.21 
percent in 2022. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for 
additional information.

Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-

offs for 2023 were $577 million (0.30 percent of average 
loans outstanding), compared with $264 million (0.16 
percent of average loans outstanding) in 2022. The increase 
in net charge-offs in 2023, compared with 2022, was driven 
primarily by normalizing credit conditions and adverse 
conditions in commercial real estate. 

44  U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report

Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs for 2023 were 

$109 million (0.09 percent of average loans outstanding), 
compared with a net recovery of $23 million (0.03 percent of 
average loans outstanding) in 2022. Credit card loan net 
charge-offs in 2023 were $849 million (3.20 percent of 
average loans outstanding), compared with $524 million 
(2.23 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2022. Other 
retail loan net charge-offs for 2023 were $370 million (0.75 
percent of average loans outstanding), compared with $298 
million (0.49 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2022. 
The increase in total residential mortgage, credit card and 
other retail loan net charge-offs in 2023, compared with 
2022, was driven by normalizing credit conditions along with 
charge-offs related to balance sheet repositioning and 
capital management actions taken in 2023. 

Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit 
Losses The allowance for credit losses is established for 
current expected credit losses on the Company’s loan and 
lease portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments. The 
allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives 
of the applicable assets, inclusive of expected recoveries. 
The allowance for credit losses is increased through 
provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net charge-
offs. 

Management evaluates the appropriateness of the 
allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis. Multiple 
economic scenarios are considered over a three-year 
reasonable and supportable forecast period, which includes 
increasing consideration of historical loss experience over 
years two and three. These economic scenarios are 
constructed with interrelated projections of multiple 
economic variables, and loss estimates are produced that 
consider the historical correlation of those economic 
variables with credit losses. After the forecast period, the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Company fully reverts to long-term historical loss 
experience, adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of 
the current loan and lease portfolio, to estimate losses over 
the remaining life of the portfolio. The economic scenarios 
are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a 
range of reasonable estimates from better to worse than 
current expectations. Scenarios are weighted based on the 
Company’s expectation of economic conditions for the 
foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and 
consideration of economic forecast uncertainty. Final loss 
estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not 
reflected in the scenarios, due to the unique aspects of 
current conditions and expectations. These factors may 
include, but are not limited to, loan servicing practices, 
regulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and monetary policy 
actions.

Because business processes and credit risks associated 
with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same 
as for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to 
estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments, which 
is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet. Both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for 
unfunded credit commitments are included in the 
Company’s analysis of credit losses and reported reserve 
ratios. 

The allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forward-
looking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors 
affecting lifetime credit losses. These factors include, but 
are not limited to, macroeconomic variables such as 
unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic 
product levels, inflation, interest rates, and corporate bond 
spreads, as well as loan and borrower characteristics, such 
as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer 
credit scores, delinquency status, collateral type and 
available valuation information, consideration of end-of-term 
losses on lease residuals, and the remaining term of the 
loan, adjusted for expected prepayments. For each loan 
portfolio, including those loans modified under various loan 
modification programs, model estimates are adjusted as 
necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio 
composition, lending policies, underwriting standards, risk 
management practices, economic conditions or other factors 
that may affect the accuracy of the model. Expected credit 
loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash 
recoveries on loans previously charged-off or expected 
recoveries on collateral-dependent loans where recovery is 
expected through sale of the collateral at fair value less 
selling costs. Where loans do not exhibit similar risk 
characteristics, an individual analysis is performed to 
consider expected credit losses. 

The allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans 
greater than $5 million in the commercial lending segment is 
based on an analysis utilizing expected cash flows 
discounted using the original effective interest rate, the 
observable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the 
collateral, less selling costs, for collateral-dependent loans 
as appropriate. 

When evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance 

for credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien 
position, the Company considers the delinquency and 
modification status of the first lien. At December 31, 2023, 

the Company serviced the first lien on 30 percent of the 
home equity loans and lines in a junior lien position. The 
Company also considers the status of first lien mortgage 
accounts reported on customer credit bureau files when the 
first lien is not serviced by the Company. Regardless of 
whether the Company services the first lien, an assessment 
is made of economic conditions, problem loans, recent loss 
experience and other factors in determining the allowance 
for credit losses. Based on the available information, the 
Company estimated $204 million or 1.6 percent of its total 
home equity portfolio at December 31, 2023, represented 
non-delinquent junior liens where the first lien was 
delinquent or modified. 

When a loan portfolio is purchased, the acquired loans 
are divided into those considered purchased with more than 
insignificant credit deterioration (“PCD”) and those not 
considered PCD. An allowance is established for each 
population and considers product mix, risk characteristics of 
the portfolio and delinquency status and refreshed LTV 
ratios when possible. PCD loans also consider whether the 
loan has experienced a charge-off, bankruptcy or significant 
deterioration since origination. The allowance established 
for purchased loans not considered PCD is recognized 
through provision expense upon acquisition, whereas the 
allowance established for loans considered PCD at 
acquisition is offset by an increase in the basis of the 
acquired loans. Any subsequent increases and decreases in 
the allowance related to purchased loans, regardless of 
PCD status, are recognized through provision expense, with 
charge-offs charged to the allowance. The Company had a 
total net book balance of $3.1 billion of PCD loans, primarily 
related to the MUB acquisition, included in its loan portfolio 
at December 31, 2023. 

The Company’s methodology for determining the 
appropriate allowance for credit losses also considers the 
imprecision inherent in the methodologies used and 
allocated to the various loan portfolios. As a result, amounts 
determined under the methodologies described above are 
adjusted by management to consider the potential impact of 
other qualitative factors not captured in quantitative model 
adjustments which include, but are not limited to, the 
following: model imprecision, imprecision in economic 
scenario assumptions, and emerging risks related to either 
changes in the economic environment that are affecting 
specific portfolios, or changes in portfolio concentrations 
over time that may affect model performance. The 
consideration of these items results in adjustments to 
allowance amounts included in the Company’s allowance for 
credit losses for each loan portfolio. 

The results of the analysis are evaluated quarterly to 
confirm the estimates are appropriate for each loan portfolio. 
Table 19 shows the amount of the allowance for credit 
losses by loan class and underlying portfolio category. 

Although the Company determined the amount of each 

element of the allowance separately and considers this 
process to be an important credit management tool, the 
entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire 
loan portfolio. The actual amount of losses can vary 
significantly from the estimated amounts. 

At December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses 
was $7.8 billion, compared with an allowance of $7.4 billion 

45

at December 31, 2022. The allowance for credit losses at 
December 31, 2023 included a $62 million decrease due to 
a change in accounting principle adopted on January 1, 
2023 related to discontinuing the separate recognition and 
measurement of troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs"). The 
increase in the allowance for credit losses of $435 million 
(5.9 percent) at December 31, 2023, compared with 
December 31, 2022, was primarily driven by normalizing 
credit losses, credit card balance growth and commercial 
real estate credit quality. 

The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end 

loans was 2.10 percent at December 31, 2023, compared 
with 1.91 percent at December 31, 2022. The ratio of the 
allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 541 
percent at December 31, 2023, compared with 762 percent 
at December 31, 2022. The ratio of the allowance for credit 

losses to annual loan net charge-offs at December 31, 
2023, was 411 percent, compared with 697 percent at 
December 31, 2022. Management determined the 
allowance for credit losses was appropriate on 
December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Economic conditions considered in estimating the 

allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023 included 
changes in projected gross domestic product and 
unemployment levels. These factors are evaluated through 
a combination of quantitative calculations using multiple 
economic scenarios and additional qualitative assessments 
that consider the degree of economic uncertainty in the 
current environment. The projected unemployment rates for 
2024 considered in the estimate range from 3.0 percent to 
8.2 percent. 

The following table summarizes the baseline forecast for key economic variables the Company used in its estimate of the 
allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023 and 2022:

The allowance for credit losses related to commercial 
lending segment loans increased $251 million during the 
year ended December 31, 2023, reflecting the impact of 
normalizing credit conditions and select commercial real 
estate loan deterioration, partially offset by declining 
commercial exposures. 

The allowance for credit losses related to consumer 
lending segment loans increased $184 million during the 
year ended December 31, 2023, due to the impacts of 
normalizing credit performance, partially offset by reduced 
portfolio exposures and a decrease related to a change in 
accounting principle.

Residual Value Risk Management The Company 
manages its risk to changes in the residual value of leased 
vehicles, office and business equipment, and other assets 
through disciplined residual valuation at the inception of a 
lease, diversification of its leased assets, regular residual 
asset valuation reviews and monitoring of residual value 
gains or losses upon the disposition of assets. Lease 
originations are subject to the same well-defined 
underwriting standards referred to in the “Credit Risk 
Management” section, which includes an evaluation of the 
residual value risk. Retail lease residual value risk is 
mitigated further by effective end-of-term marketing of off-
lease vehicles. 

Included in the retail leasing portfolio was approximately 
$3.4 billion of retail leasing residuals at December 31, 2023, 
compared with $4.4 billion at December 31, 2022. The 
Company monitors concentrations of leases by 
manufacturer and vehicle type. As of December 31, 2023, 
vehicle lease residuals related to sport utility vehicles were 
53.5 percent of the portfolio, while truck and crossover utility 
vehicle classes represented approximately 21.4 percent and 
13.7 percent of the portfolio, respectively. At year-end 2023, 
the individual vehicle model with the largest residual value 
outstanding represented 27.0 percent of the aggregate 
residual value of all vehicles in the portfolio. At 
December 31, 2023, the weighted-average origination term 
of the portfolio was 41 months, compared with 42 months at 
December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2023, the commercial 
leasing portfolio had $491 million of residuals, compared 
with $500 million at December 31, 2022. At year-end 2023, 
lease residuals related to trucks and other transportation 
equipment represented 38.0 percent of the total residual 
portfolio, while business and office equipment represented 
28.5 percent.

Operational Risk Management. The Company operates in 
many different businesses in diverse markets and relies on 
the ability of its employees and systems to process a high 
number of transactions. Operational risk is inherent in all 
business activities, and the management of this risk is 
important to the achievement of the Company’s objectives. 
Business lines have direct and primary responsibility and 
accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring 
operational risks embedded in their business activities, 
including those additional or increased risks created by 
economic and financial disruptions. 

The Company maintains a system of controls with the 
objective of providing proper transaction authorization and 
execution, proper system operations, proper oversight of 
third parties with whom it does business, safeguarding of 
assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability and 
security of financial and other data. The Company also 
maintains a cybersecurity risk program which provides 
centralized planning and management of related and 
interdependent work with a focus on risks from 
cybersecurity threats. The Company's cybersecurity risk 
program is integrated into the Company's overall business 
and operational strategies and requires that the Company 
allocate appropriate resources to maintain the program. 
Refer to “Item 1C. Cybersecurity” in the Company’s Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 
2023, for further discussion on the Company's cybersecurity 
risk program.

Business continuation and disaster recovery planning is 
also critical to effectively managing operational risks. Each 
business unit of the Company is required to develop, 
maintain and test these plans at least annually to ensure 
that recovery activities, if needed, can support mission 
critical functions, including technology, networks and data 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
centers supporting customer applications and business 
operations. 

While the Company strives to design processes to 
minimize operational risks, there is no absolute assurance 
that business disruption or operational losses would not 
occur from an external event or internal control breakdown. 
On an ongoing basis, management makes process changes 
and investments to enhance its systems of internal controls 
and business continuity and disaster recovery plans. 

Compliance Risk Management The Company may suffer 
legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or 
damage to its reputation if it fails to comply with laws, 
regulations, rules, standards of good practice, and codes of 
conduct, including those related to compliance with Bank 
Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering requirements, sanctions 
compliance requirements as administered by the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control, consumer protection and other 
requirements. The Company has controls and processes in 
place for the assessment, identification, monitoring, 
management and reporting of compliance risks and issues, 
including those created or increased by economic and 
financial disruptions. Refer to “Supervision and Regulation” 
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year 
ended December 31, 2023, for further discussion of the 
regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies 
and their subsidiaries. 

Interest Rate Risk Management In the banking industry, 
changes in interest rates are a significant risk that can 
impact earnings as well as the safety and soundness of an 
entity. The Company manages its exposure to changes in 
interest rates through asset and liability management 
activities within guidelines established by its Asset Liability 
Management Committee (“ALCO”) and approved by the 
Board of Directors. The ALCO has the responsibility for 
approving and overseeing compliance with the ALCO 
management policies, including interest rate risk exposure. 
One way the Company measures and analyzes its interest 
rate risk is through analysis of net interest income 
sensitivities across a range of scenarios. 

Net interest income sensitivity analysis includes 

evaluating all of the Company’s assets and liabilities and off-
balance sheet instruments, inclusive of new business 
activity under various interest rate scenarios that differ in the 
direction, amount and speed of change over time, as well as 
the overall shape of the yield curve. The balance sheet 
includes assumptions regarding loan and deposit volumes 
and pricing which are based on quantitative analysis, 
historical trends and management outlook and strategies. 
Deposit balances and mix are dynamic across interest rate 
scenarios and will change both with the absolute level of 
rates as well as the assumed interest rate shock. Base case 
and net interest income sensitivities are reviewed monthly 
by the ALCO and are used to guide asset/liability 
management strategies. 

The Company also manages interest rate sensitivity by 
utilizing market value of equity modeling, which measures 
the degree to which the market values of the Company’s 
assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments will 
change given a change in interest rates. Management 

measures the impact of changes in market values due to 
interest rates under a number of scenarios, including 
immediate and sustained parallel shifts, and flattening or 
steepening of the yield curve. The Company manages its 
interest rate risk position by holding assets with desired 
interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet, 
executing certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits 
and deploying investment portfolio, funding and derivative 
strategies . 

Table 20 summarizes the projected impact to net interest 
income over the next 12 months of various potential interest 
rate changes. The sensitivity of the projected impact to net 
interest income over the next 12 months is dependent on 
balance sheet growth, product mix, deposit behavior, pricing 
and funding decisions. From December 31, 2022 to 
December 31, 2023, interest rate sensitivity decreased, 
primarily due to changes in deposit composition and rates 
paid on deposits as interest rate hikes materialized 
throughout 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Company 
continues to be slightly asset sensitive to a parallel upward 
move in interest rates with most of that impact coming from 
the short end of the yield curve. While the Company utilizes 
models and assumptions based on historical information 
and expected behaviors, actual outcomes could vary 
significantly. 

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other 
Risks To manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to 
interest rate, prepayment, credit, price and foreign currency 
fluctuations (asset and liability management positions), the 
Company enters into derivative transactions. The Company 
uses derivatives for asset and liability management 
purposes primarily in the following ways: 

• To convert fixed-rate debt and available-for-sale 

investment securities from fixed-rate payments to floating-
rate payments;  

• To convert floating-rate loans and debt from floating-rate 

payments to fixed-rate payments; 

• To mitigate changes in value of the Company’s unfunded 
mortgage loan commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs; 

• To mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency 

denominated balances; and 

• To mitigate the volatility of the Company’s net investment 

in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign 
currency exchange rates. 

In addition, the Company enters into interest rate, foreign 
exchange and commodity derivative contracts to support the 
business requirements of its customers (customer-related 
positions). The Company minimizes the market and liquidity 
risks of customer-related positions by either entering into 
similar offsetting positions with broker-dealers, or on a 
portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or non-
derivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset 
the exposure from these customer-related positions. The 
Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either 
exchange-traded, centrally cleared through clearinghouses 
or over-the-counter. The Company does not utilize 
derivatives for speculative purposes.

The Company does not designate all of the derivatives 

that it enters into for risk management purposes as 
accounting hedges because of the inefficiency of applying 
the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair 
value accounting for the related hedged items. In particular, 
the Company enters into interest rate swaps, swaptions, 
forward commitments to buy to-be-announced securities 
(“TBAs”), U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options 
on U.S. Treasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value 
of its MSRs, but does not designate those derivatives as 
accounting hedges. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information 
regarding MSRs, including management of the changes in 
fair value. 

Additionally, the Company uses forward commitments to 

sell TBAs and other commitments to sell residential 
mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge 
the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan 
production activities. The forward commitments to sell and 
the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans 
intended to be sold are considered derivatives under the 
accounting guidance related to accounting for derivative 
instruments and hedging activities. The Company has 
elected the fair value option for the MLHFS. 

Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with 
counterparties to the contracts. Credit risk associated with 
derivatives is measured by the Company based on the 
probability of counterparty default. The Company manages 
the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its 
positions among various counterparties, by entering into 
master netting arrangements, and, where possible, by 
requiring collateral arrangements. The Company may also 
transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate 
swaps to third parties through the use of risk participation 
agreements. In addition, certain interest rate swaps, interest 
rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be 
centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate 
counterparty credit risk. The Company also mitigates the 
credit risk of its derivative positions, as well as the credit risk 
on loans or lending portfolios, through the use of credit 
contracts. 

For additional information on derivatives and hedging 

activities, refer to Notes 20 and 21 in the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Market Risk Management In addition to interest rate risk, 
the Company is exposed to other forms of market risk, 
principally related to trading activities which support 
customers’ strategies to manage their own foreign currency, 
interest rate risk, commodities risk and funding activities. 
For purposes of its internal capital adequacy assessment 
process, the Company considers risk arising from its trading 
activities, as well as the remeasurement volatility of foreign 
currency denominated balances included on its 
Consolidated Balance Sheet (collectively, “Covered 

50  U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report

Positions”), employing methodologies consistent with the 
requirements of regulatory rules for market risk. The 
Company’s Market Risk Committee (“MRC”), within the 
framework of the ALCO, oversees market risk management. 
The MRC monitors and reviews the Company’s Covered 
Positions and establishes policies for market risk 
management, including exposure limits for each portfolio. 
The Company uses a VaR approach to measure general 
market risk. Theoretically, VaR represents the statistical risk 
of loss the Company has to adverse market movements 
over a one-day time horizon. The Company uses the 
Historical Simulation method to calculate VaR for its 
Covered Positions measured at the ninety-ninth percentile 
using a one-year look-back period for distributions derived 
from past market data. The market factors used in the 
calculations include those pertinent to market risks inherent 
in the underlying trading portfolios, principally those that 
affect the Company’s corporate bond trading business, 
foreign currency transaction business, client derivatives 
business, loan trading business and municipal securities 
business, as well as those inherent in the Company’s 
foreign denominated balances and the derivatives used to 
mitigate the related measurement volatility. On average, the 
Company expects the one-day VaR to be exceeded by 
actual losses two to three times per year related to these 
positions. The Company monitors the accuracy of internal 
VaR models and modeling processes by back-testing model 
performance, regularly updating the historical data used by 
the VaR models and regular model validations to assess the 
accuracy of the models’ input, processing, and reporting 
components. All models are required to be independently 
reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use. If the 
Company were to experience market losses in excess of the 
estimated VaR more often than expected, the VaR models 
and associated assumptions would be analyzed and 
adjusted. VaR amounts reflected MUB beginning December 
1, 2022, the day the acquisition transaction closed. 

The average, high, low and period-end one-day VaR 
amounts for the Company’s Covered Positions were as

The Company did not experience any actual losses for 
its combined Covered Positions that exceeded VaR during 
the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The 
Company stress tests its market risk measurements to 
provide management with perspectives on market events 
that may not be captured by its VaR models, including worst 

 
 
 
case historical market movement combinations that have 
not necessarily occurred on the same date. 

The Company calculates Stressed VaR using the same 

underlying methodology and model as VaR, except that a 
historical continuous one-year look-back period is utilized 
that reflects a period of significant financial stress 
appropriate to the Company’s Covered Positions. The 
period selected by the Company includes the significant 
market volatility of the last four months of 2008.

Valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign 

currency activities are based on discounted cash flow or 
other valuation techniques using market-based 
assumptions. These valuations are compared to third-party 
quotes or other market prices to determine if there are 
significant variances. Significant variances are approved by 
senior management in the Company’s corporate functions. 
Valuation of positions in the corporate bond trading, loan 
trading and municipal securities businesses are based on 
trader marks. These trader marks are evaluated against 
third-party prices, with significant variances approved by 
senior management in the Company’s corporate functions. 
The Company also measures the market risk of its 
hedging activities related to residential MLHFS and MSRs 
using the Historical Simulation method. The VaRs are 
measured at the ninety-ninth percentile and employ factors 
pertinent to the market risks inherent in the valuation of the 
assets and hedges. A one-year look-back period is used to 
obtain past market data for the models.

Liquidity Risk Management The Company’s liquidity risk 
management process is designed to identify, measure, and 
manage the Company’s funding and liquidity risk to meet its 
daily funding needs and to address expected and 
unexpected changes in its funding requirements. The 
Company engages in various activities to manage its 
liquidity risk. These activities include diversifying its funding 
sources, stress testing, and holding readily-marketable 
assets which can be used as a source of liquidity if needed. 
In addition, the Company’s profitable operations, sound 
credit quality and strong credit ratings and capital position 
have enabled it to develop a large and reliable base of core 
deposit funding within its market areas and in domestic and 
global capital markets. 

The Company’s Board of Directors approves the 

Company’s liquidity policy. The Risk Management 
Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors oversees 
the Company’s liquidity risk management process and 
approves a contingency funding plan. The ALCO reviews 
the Company’s liquidity policy and limits, and regularly 
assesses the Company’s ability to meet funding 
requirements arising from adverse company-specific or 
market events. 

The Company’s liquidity policy requires it to maintain 
diversified wholesale funding sources to avoid maturity, 
entity and market concentrations. The Company operates a 
Cayman Islands branch for issuing Eurodollar time deposits. 
In addition, the Company has relationships with dealers to 
issue national market retail and institutional savings 
certificates and short-term and medium-term notes. The 
Company also maintains a significant correspondent 
banking network and relationships. Accordingly, the 
Company has access to national federal funds, funding 
through repurchase agreements and sources of stable 
certificates of deposit and commercial paper. 

The Company regularly projects its funding needs under 

various stress scenarios and maintains a contingency 
funding plan consistent with the Company’s access to 
diversified sources of contingent funding. The Company 
maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the 
form of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding 
sources. These liquidity sources include cash at the Federal 
Reserve Bank and certain European central banks, 
unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow from 
the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Bank’s Discount 
Window. Unencumbered liquid assets in the Company’s 
investment securities portfolio provide asset liquidity through 
the Company’s ability to sell the securities or pledge and 
borrow against them. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements and “Balance Sheet 
Analysis” for further information on investment securities 
maturities and trends. Asset liquidity is further enhanced by 
the Company’s practice of pledging loans to access secured 
borrowing facilities through the FHLB and Federal Reserve 
Bank.

The Company’s diversified deposit base provides a 
sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, 
while reducing the Company’s reliance on the wholesale 
markets. Total deposits were $512.3 billion at December 31, 
2023, compared with $525.0 billion at December 31, 2022. 
Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements and “Balance Sheet Analysis” for further 
information on the maturities, terms and trends of the 
Company’s deposits. 

TABLE 21 Credit Ratings

Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and 
short-term borrowings. Long-term debt was $51.5 billion at 
December 31, 2023, and is an important funding source 
because of its multi-year borrowing structure. Refer to Note 
14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for 
information on the terms and maturities of the Company’s 
long-term debt issuances and “Balance Sheet Analysis” for 
discussion on long-term debt trends. Short-term borrowings 
were $15.3 billion at December 31, 2023, and supplement 
the Company’s other funding sources. Refer to Note 13 of 
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and 
“Balance Sheet Analysis” for further information on the 
terms and trends of the Company’s short-term borrowings. 
The Company’s ability to raise negotiated funding at 
competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies’ views of 
the Company’s credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings.

In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated 
basis, the Company monitors the parent company’s liquidity. 
The parent company’s routine funding requirements consist 
primarily of operating expenses, dividends paid to 
shareholders, debt service, repurchases of common stock 
and funds used for acquisitions. The parent company 
obtains funding to meet its obligations from dividends 
collected from its subsidiaries and the issuance of debt and 
capital securities. The Company establishes limits for the 
minimal number of months into the future where the parent 
company can meet existing and forecasted obligations with 

52  U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report

cash and securities held that can be readily monetized. The 
Company measures and manages this limit in both normal 
and adverse conditions. The Company maintains sufficient 
funding to meet expected capital and debt service 
obligations for 24 months without the support of dividends 
from subsidiaries and assuming access to the wholesale 
markets is maintained. The Company maintains sufficient 
liquidity to meet its capital and debt service obligations for 
12 months under adverse conditions without the support of 
dividends from subsidiaries or access to the wholesale 

 
markets. The parent company is currently in excess of 
required liquidity minimums. 

Under SEC rules, the parent company is classified as a 

“well-known seasoned issuer,” which allows it to file a 
registration statement that does not have a limit on issuance 
capacity. “Well-known seasoned issuers” generally include 
those companies with outstanding common securities with a 
market value of at least $700 million held by non-affiliated 
parties or those companies that have issued at least $1 
billion in aggregate principal amount of non-convertible 
securities, other than common equity, in the last three years. 
However, the parent company’s ability to issue debt and 
other securities under a registration statement filed with the 
SEC under these rules is limited by the debt issuance 
authority granted by the Company’s Board of Directors and/
or the ALCO policy. 

At December 31, 2023, parent company long-term debt 
outstanding was $34.3 billion, compared with $27.0 billion at 
December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to 
$8.2 billion of medium-term note issuances, partially offset 
by a $936 million repayment of the Company's debt 
obligation to MUFG. As of December 31, 2023, there was 
$5.6 billion of parent company debt scheduled to mature in 
2024. Future debt maturities may be met through medium-
term note and capital security issuances and dividends from 
subsidiaries, as well as from parent company cash and cash 
equivalents. 

Dividend payments to the Company by its subsidiary 

banks are subject to regulatory review and statutory 
limitations and, in some instances, regulatory approval. In 
general, dividends to the parent company from its banking 
subsidiaries are limited by rules which compare dividends to 
net income for regulatorily-defined periods. For further 
information, see Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 

The Company is subject to a regulatory Liquidity 

Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) requirement which requires large 
banking organizations to maintain an adequate level of 
unencumbered high quality liquid assets to meet estimated 
liquidity needs over a 30-day stressed period. At 
December 31, 2023, the Company was compliant with this 
requirement. 

The Company is also subject to a regulatory Net Stable 
Funding Ratio (“NSFR”) requirement which requires large 
banking organizations to maintain a minimum level of stable 
funding based on the liquidity characteristics of their assets, 
commitments, and derivative exposures over a one-year 
time horizon. At December 31, 2023, the Company was 
compliant with this requirement. 

European Exposures The Company provides merchant 
processing and corporate trust services in Europe either 
directly or through banking affiliations in Europe. Revenue 
generated from sources in Europe represented 
approximately 2 percent of the Company’s total net revenue 
for 2023. Operating cash for these businesses is deposited 
on a short-term basis typically with certain European central 
banks. For deposits placed at other European banks, 
exposure is mitigated by the Company placing deposits at 
multiple banks and managing the amounts on deposit at any 
bank based on institution-specific deposit limits. At 
December 31, 2023, the Company had an aggregate 

amount on deposit with European banks of approximately 
$7.3 billion, predominately with the Central Bank of Ireland 
and Bank of England. 

In addition, the Company provides financing to domestic 

multinational corporations that generate revenue from 
customers in European countries, transacts with various 
European banks as counterparties to certain derivative-
related activities, and through a subsidiary, manages money 
market funds that hold certain investments in European 
sovereign debt. Any deterioration in economic conditions in 
Europe, including the impacts resulting from the Russia-
Ukraine conflict, is not expected to have a significant effect 
on the Company related to these activities. 

Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Other 
Contractual Obligations The Company participates in 
many different contractual arrangements which may or may 
not be recorded on its balance sheet, with unrelated or 
consolidated entities, under which the Company has an 
obligation to pay certain amounts, provide credit or liquidity 
enhancements or provide market risk support. These 
arrangements also include any obligation related to a 
variable interest held in an unconsolidated entity that 
provides financing, liquidity, credit enhancement or market 
risk support. 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters 

into contractual obligations that may require future cash 
payments, including funding for customer loan requests, 
customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, 
leases for premises and equipment, and other cash 
commitments. Refer to Notes 7, 12, 14, 17 and 23 in the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information 
on the Company’s operating lease obligations, deposits, 
long-term debt, benefit obligations and guarantees and 
other commitments, respectively. 

Commitments to extend credit are legally binding and 
generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination 
clauses. Many of the Company’s commitments to extend 
credit expire without being drawn and, therefore, total 
commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future 
liquidity requirements or the Company’s exposure to credit 
loss. Commitments to extend credit also include consumer 
credit lines that are cancellable upon notification to the 
consumer. Total contractual amounts of commitments to 
extend credit at December 31, 2023 were $400.5 billion. 
The Company also issues and confirms various types of 
letters of credit, including standby and commercial. Total 
contractual amounts of letters of credit at December 31, 
2023 were $11.6 billion. For more information on the 
Company’s commitments to extend credit and letters of 
credit, refer to Note 23 in the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 

The Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements with 

unconsolidated entities primarily consist of private 
investment funds or partnerships that make equity 
investments, provide debt financing or support community-
based investments in tax-advantaged projects. In addition to 
providing investment returns, these arrangements in many 
cases assist the Company in complying with requirements 
of the Community Reinvestment Act. The investments in 
these entities generate a return primarily through the 
realization of federal and state income tax credits and other 

53

tax benefits, such as tax deductions from operating losses 
of the investments, over specified time periods. The entities 
in which the Company invests are generally considered 
variable interest entities (“VIEs”). The Company’s recorded 
investment in these entities, net of contractual equity 
investment commitments of $3.6 billion, was $3.0 billion at 
December 31, 2023. 

The Company also has non-controlling financial 

investments in private funds and partnerships considered 
VIEs. The Company’s recorded investment in these entities 
was approximately $219 million at December 31, 2023, and 
the Company had unfunded commitments to invest an 
additional $100 million. For more information on the 
Company’s interests in unconsolidated VIEs, refer to Note 8 
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by the 
Company to customers or other third parties requiring the 
Company to perform if certain conditions exist or upon the 
occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event, such as a 
scheduled payment to be made under contract. The 
Company’s primary guarantees include commitments from 
securities lending activities in which indemnifications are 
provided to customers; indemnification or buy-back 
provisions related to sales of loans and tax credit 
investments; and merchant charge-back guarantees through 
the Company’s involvement in providing merchant 
processing services. For certain guarantees, the Company 
may have access to collateral to support the guarantee, or 
through the exercise of other recourse provisions, be able to 
offset some or all of any payments made under these 
guarantees. 

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries, along with 

other Visa U.S.A. Inc. member banks, have a contingent 
guarantee obligation to indemnify Visa Inc. for potential 
losses arising from antitrust lawsuits challenging the 
practices of Visa U.S.A. Inc. and MasterCard International. 
The indemnification by the Company and other Visa U.S.A. 
Inc. member banks has no maximum amount. Refer to Note 
23 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for 
further details regarding guarantees, other commitments, 
and contingent liabilities, including maximum potential future 
payments and current carrying amounts. 

Capital Management The Company is committed to 
managing capital to maintain strong protection for 
depositors and creditors and for maximum shareholder 
benefit. The Company also manages its capital to exceed 
regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations. 
To achieve its capital goals, the Company employs a variety 
of capital management tools, including dividends, common 
share repurchases, and the issuance of subordinated debt, 
non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, common stock 
and other capital instruments. 

The Company announced on December 12, 2023 that its 

Board of Directors had approved a regular quarterly 
dividend of $0.49 per common share. This represented a 
2.1 percent increase over the previous dividend rate per 
common share of $0.48 per quarter. 

The Company announced on December 22, 2020 that its 

Board of Directors had approved an authorization to 
repurchase $3.0 billion of its common stock beginning 

54  U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report

January 1, 2021. The Company suspended all common 
stock repurchases at the beginning of the third quarter of 
2021, except for those done exclusively in connection with 
its stock-based compensation programs, due to its 
acquisition of MUB. The Company will evaluate its share 
repurchases in connection with the potential capital 
requirements given proposed regulatory capital rules and 
related landscape. 

Capital distributions, including dividends and stock 
repurchases, are subject to the approval of the Company’s 
Board of Directors and compliance with regulatory 
requirements. For a more complete analysis of activities 
impacting shareholders’ equity and capital management 
programs, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 

Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders’ equity was $55.3 billion 

at December 31, 2023, compared with $50.8 billion at 
December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily the result of 
corporate earnings, the issuance of shares of common stock 
and changes in unrealized gains and losses on available-
for-sale investment securities included in other 
comprehensive income (loss), partially offset by dividends 
paid. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company issued 24 
million shares of common stock of the Company to an 
affiliate of MUFG for a purchase price of $936 million. The 
proceeds of the issuance were used to repay a portion of 
the Company’s $3.5 billion debt obligation to MUFG. See 
“MUFG Union Bank Acquisition” on page 22 for further 
information.

The regulatory capital requirements effective for the 
Company follow Basel III, with the Company being subject 
to calculating its capital adequacy as a percentage of risk-
weighted assets under the standardized approach. Under 
Basel III, banking regulators define minimum capital 
requirements for banks and financial services holding 
companies. These requirements are expressed in the form 
of a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 
capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, tier 1 leverage 
ratio and a tier 1 total leverage exposure, or supplementary 
leverage, ratio. The Company’s minimum required level for 
these ratios at December 31, 2023, which include a stress 
capital buffer of 2.5 percent for the common equity tier 1 
capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios, was 7.0 percent, 
8.5 percent, 10.5 percent, 4.0 percent, and 3.0 percent, 
respectively. The Company targets its regulatory capital 
levels, at both the bank and bank holding company level, to 
exceed the “well-capitalized” threshold for these ratios under 
the FDIC Improvement Act prompt corrective action 
provisions that are applicable to all banks. At December 31, 
2023, the minimum “well-capitalized” thresholds under the 
prompt corrective action framework for the common equity 
tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 capital ratio, total risk-based capital 
ratio, tier 1 leverage ratio, and tier 1 total leverage exposure 
ratio was 6.5 percent, 8.0 percent, 10.0 percent, 5.0 
percent, and 3.0 percent, respectively. Beginning in 2022, 
the Company began to phase into its regulatory capital 
requirements the cumulative deferred impact of its 2020 
adoption of the accounting guidance related to the 
impairment of financial instruments based on the current 
expected credit losses (“CECL”) methodology plus 25 
percent of its quarterly credit reserve increases during 2020 

and 2021. This cumulative deferred impact will continue to 
be phased into the Company’s regulatory capital over the 
next year, culminating with a fully phased in regulatory 
capital calculation beginning in 2025. As of December 31, 
2023, USBNA met all regulatory capital ratios to be

Table 22 provides a summary of statutory regulatory 
capital ratios in effect for the Company at December 31, 
2023 and 2022. All regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory 
“well-capitalized” requirements. 

In July 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory authorities 

proposed a rule implementing the Basel Committee’s 
finalization of the post-crisis regulatory capital reforms. The 
proposal provides for a July 1, 2025 effective date, subject 
to a three-year transition period. The proposal includes the 
Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, which replaces 
the market risk rule, and introduces new standardized 
approaches for credit risk, operational risk and credit 
valuation adjustment (CVA) risk, which would replace the 
current models-based approaches. The Company is 
currently evaluating the impact of the proposed rule and 
expects that any final rule would result in the Company 
being required to maintain increased levels of regulatory 
capital. 

The Company believes certain other capital ratios are 
useful in evaluating its capital adequacy. The Company’s 
tangible common equity, as a percent of tangible assets and 
as a percent of risk-weighted assets determined in 

accordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements 
related to the CECL methodology under the standardized 
approach, was 5.3 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively, at 
December 31, 2023, compared with 4.5 percent and 6.0 
percent at December 31, 2022, respectively. In addition, the 
Company’s common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted 
assets ratio, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL 
methodology was 9.7 percent at December 31, 2023, 
compared with 8.1 percent at December 31, 2022. Refer to 
“Non-GAAP Financial Measures” beginning on page 59 for 
further information on these other capital ratios. 

As an approved mortgage seller and servicer, USBNA, 

through its mortgage banking division, is required to 
maintain various levels of shareholder’s equity, as specified 
by various agencies, including the United States 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
Government National Mortgage Association, Federal Home 
Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National 
Mortgage Association. At December 31, 2023, USBNA met 
these requirements.

Line of Business Financial Review 

The Company’s major lines of business are Wealth, 
Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking, Consumer 
and Business Banking, Payment Services, and Treasury 
and Corporate Support.

Basis for Financial Presentation Business line results are 
derived from the Company’s business unit profitability 
reporting systems by specifically attributing managed 
balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their 
related income or expense. Refer to Note 24 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on 
the business lines’ basis for financial presentation. 

Designations, assignments and allocations change from 

time to time as management systems are enhanced, 
methods of evaluating performance or product lines change 
or business segments are realigned to better respond to the 
Company’s diverse customer base. During 2023, certain 
organization and methodology changes were made, 
including the Company combining its Wealth Management 
and Investment Services and Corporate and Commercial 
Banking lines of businesses to create the Wealth, 
Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking line of 
business. 2022 results were restated and presented on a 
comparable basis. 

Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional 
Banking Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional 
Banking provides core banking, specialized lending, 
transaction and payment processing, capital markets, asset 
management, and brokerage and investment related 
services to wealth, middle market, large corporate, 
government and institutional clients. Wealth, Corporate, 
Commercial and Institutional Banking contributed $3.6 
billion of the Company’s net income in 2023, or an increase 
of $202 million (6.0 percent), compared with 2022. 

Net revenue increased $1.5 billion (17.1 percent) in 

2023, compared with 2022. Net interest income, on a 
taxable-equivalent basis, increased $916 million (17.6 
percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, primarily due to the 
impact of higher rates on the margin benefit from deposits 
and the acquisition of MUB, partially offset by the impact of 
deposit mix and pricing. Noninterest income increased $582 
million (16.3 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, 
primarily due to higher trust and investment management 
fees driven by the acquisition of MUB and core business 
growth, and higher commercial products revenue mainly 
due to higher trading revenue and corporate bond fees. 

Noninterest expense increased $1.0 billion (25.3 percent) 

in 2023, compared with 2022, primarily due to higher FDIC 
insurance expense driven by an increase in the assessment 
base and rate along with the inclusion of MUB in the current 
year. Compensation and employee benefits expense and 
net shared services expense were also higher, driven by 
investment in support of business growth and the impact of 
the MUB acquisition, including intangible amortization driven 
by the core deposit intangible. The provision for credit 
losses increased $180 million in 2023, compared with 2022, 
primarily due to commercial real estate credit quality. 

Consumer and Business Banking Consumer and 
Business Banking comprises consumer banking, small 

56  U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report

business banking and consumer lending. Products and 
services are delivered through banking offices, telephone 
servicing and sales, online services, direct mail, ATM 
processing, mobile devices, distributed mortgage loan 
officers, and intermediary relationships including auto 
dealerships, mortgage banks, and strategic business 
partners. Consumer and Business Banking contributed $2.2 
billion of the Company’s net income in 2023, or an increase 
of $378 million (20.6 percent), compared with 2022. 

Net revenue increased $1.7 billion (20.4 percent) in 

2023, compared with 2022. Net interest income, on a 
taxable-equivalent basis, increased $1.6 billion (23.2 
percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, reflecting the 
favorable impact of higher rates on the margin benefit of 
deposits and the acquisition of MUB, partially offset by the 
impact of deposit mix and pricing. Noninterest income 
increased $126 million (8.2 percent) in 2023, compared with 
2022, primarily due to higher mortgage banking revenue 
driven by increases in MSR valuations, net of hedging 
activities, along with the impact of the MUB acquisition. 

Noninterest expense increased $1.2 billion (20.5 percent) 

in 2023, compared with 2022, primarily due to increases in 
compensation and employee benefits expense and net 
shared services expense due to investments in digital 
capabilities, and the impact of the MUB acquisition, 
including intangible amortization driven by the core deposit 
intangible. The provision for credit losses increased $4 
million (5.3 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, due to 
normalizing credit conditions, partially offset by declining 
loan balances. 

Payment Services Payment Services includes consumer 
and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, 
corporate, government and purchasing card services and 
merchant processing. Payment Services contributed $1.2 
billion of the Company’s net income in 2023, or a decrease 
of $150 million (11.2 percent), compared with 2022. 

Net revenue increased $460 million (7.3 percent) in 

2023, compared with 2022. Net interest income, on a 
taxable-equivalent basis, increased $198 million (7.9 
percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, primarily due to 
higher loan yields driven by higher interest rates and lower 
payment rates, along with higher loan balances, partially 
offset by higher funding costs. Noninterest income 
increased $262 million (6.9 percent) in 2023, compared with 
2022, driven by higher card revenue and merchant 
processing services revenue due to higher spend volume, 
along with higher corporate payment products revenue due 
to product mix. 

Noninterest expense increased $247 million (7.0 percent) 

in 2023, compared with 2022, reflecting higher net shared 
services expense driven by investment in infrastructure and 
technology development, in addition to higher compensation 
and employee benefits expense as a result of merit 
increases and core business growth. The provision for credit 
losses increased $414 million (42.2 percent) in 2023, 
compared with 2022, primarily due to normalizing credit 
conditions exhibited through increasing delinquency and 
credit loss rates.

Treasury and Corporate Support Treasury and Corporate 
Support includes the Company’s investment portfolios, 

funding, capital management, interest rate risk 
management, income taxes not allocated to the business 
lines, including most investments in tax-advantaged 
projects, and the residual aggregate of those expenses 
associated with corporate activities that are managed on a 
consolidated basis. Treasury and Corporate Support 
recorded a net loss of $1.5 billion in 2023, compared with a 
net loss of $716 million in 2022. 

Net revenue increased $191 million (20.5 percent) in 
2023, compared with 2022. Noninterest income increased 
$191 million (33.8 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, 
primarily due to the impacts of balance sheet repositioning 
and capital management actions taken in the fourth quarter 
of 2022, partially offset by losses on the sale of investment 
securities in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to balance 
sheet repositioning. Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, was unchanged in 2023, compared with 
2022, driven by higher funding costs, offset by higher yields 
on the investment portfolio and cash balances. 

Noninterest expense increased $1.5 billion in 2023, 

compared with 2022, primarily due to merger and integration 
charges and operating expenses related to the acquisition of 
MUB, the FDIC special assessment charge, higher 
compensation and employee benefits expense reflecting 
merit increases and hiring to support business growth, and 
higher marketing and business development expense as the 
Company continues to invest in its national brand and global 
reach. These increases were partially offset by lower net 
shared services expense. The provision for credit losses 
was $300 million (39.1 percent) lower in 2023, compared 
with 2022, primarily due to the initial provision for credit 
losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to the 
MUB acquisition. 

Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a 

managerial tax rate of 25.0 percent with the residual tax 
expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax 
rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support.
