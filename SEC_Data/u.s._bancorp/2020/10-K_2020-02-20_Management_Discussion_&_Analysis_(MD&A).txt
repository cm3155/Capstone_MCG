Management’s Discussion and Analysis  

Overview 
In 2019, U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) 
continued to demonstrate its financial strength and shareholder 
focus. Despite a challenging interest rate environment, the 
Company had record net revenue and diluted earnings per share, 
while continuing to invest in digital capabilities and key business 
initiatives to drive growth and improve efficiencies in the future. 
The Company earned $6.9 billion in 2019, a decrease of 
$182 million (2.6 percent) from 2018, reflecting higher noninterest 
expense, partially offset by net revenue growth. Net interest 
income increased as a result of loan growth and higher yields on 
the reinvestment of securities, partially offset by the impact of a 
flatter yield curve and changes in deposit and funding mix. 
Noninterest income increased due to growth in mortgage banking 
revenue, payment services revenue, trust and investment 
management fees, and commercial products revenue, partially 
offset by a decrease in deposit service charges. The Company’s 
continued focus on controlling expenses allowed it to achieve an 
industry-leading efficiency ratio of 55.8 percent in 2019. In 
addition, the Company’s return on average assets and return on 
average common equity were 1.45 percent and 14.1 percent, 
respectively. 

The Company remains deeply committed to value creation for 
shareholders. During 2019, the Company increased its dividend 
rate per common share by 13.5 percent and expanded its 
common share repurchase program, resulting in the Company 
returning $7.0 billion of its earnings to common shareholders 
through dividends and common share repurchases during the 
year. This expanded capital distribution reflects the Company’s 
ability to prudently manage capital as it responds to changes in 
the regulatory landscape, while continuing to invest for the future. 
The Company’s common equity tier 1 to risk-weighted assets 
ratio using the Basel III standardized approach was 9.1 percent at 

December 31, 2019. Refer to Table 23 for a summary of the 
statutory capital ratios in effect for the Company at December 31, 
2019 and 2018. Further, credit rating organizations rate the 
Company’s debt among the highest of any bank in the world. 
This comparative financial strength provides the Company with 
favorable funding costs, strong liquidity and the ability to attract 
new customers. 

In 2019, average loans increased $10.0 billion 

(3.6 percent) over 2018, reflecting higher demand for loans from 
new and existing customers. Loan growth included increases in 
residential mortgages, commercial loans, credit card loans and 
other retail loans. These increases were partially offset by a 
decrease in commercial real estate loans, due to new originations 
being more than offset by customers paying down balances over 
the past year and prudent credit underwriting, given the later 
stage of the business cycle. 

The Company’s provision for credit losses in 2019 increased 
$125 million (9.1 percent) over 2018 and was $50 million higher 
than net charge-offs in 2019, compared with $25 million higher 
than net charge-offs in 2018. The increases in the provision and 
allowance for credit losses during 2019 reflected loan portfolio 
growth. 

The Company’s strong 2019 financial results and momentum 

in its lending and fee businesses position it well for 2020. The 
Company’s focus on value creation supported continued 
customer acquisition and deepening of existing relationships 
across the franchise, which in turn drove strong account and 
volume growth in its fee businesses and strong loan and deposit 
growth in its banking businesses. The Company remains 
committed to delivering best-in-class products and services and 
in 2020 will continue to enhance its digital capabilities aimed at 
improving the customer experience and making it simpler and 
more productive to do business with.

Results for 2018 Compared With 2017 For discussion related 
to changes in financial condition and results of operations for 
2018 compared with 2017, refer to “Management’s Discussion 
and Analysis” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 
the year ended December 31, 2018, which was filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission on February 21, 2019. 

Earnings Summary The Company reported net income 
attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $6.9 billion in 2019, or $4.16 per 
diluted common share, compared with $7.1 billion, or $4.14 per 
diluted common share, in 2018. Return on average assets and 
return on average common equity were 1.45 percent and 
14.1 percent, respectively, in 2019, compared with 1.55 percent 
and 15.4 percent, respectively, in 2018. The results for 2019 
included the impact of restructuring charges including severance 
and certain asset impairments, and an increased derivative liability 
related to Visa shares previously sold by the Company. 
Combined, these items decreased 2019 diluted earnings per 
common share by $0.17. 

Total net revenue for 2019 was $349 million (1.5 percent) 
higher than 2018, reflecting a 1.0 percent increase in net interest 
income (0.9 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis), and a 
2.4 percent increase in noninterest income. The increase in net 
interest income from the prior year was mainly a result of loan 
growth and higher yields on the reinvestment of securities, 
partially offset by the impact of a flatter yield curve and changes 
in deposit and funding mix. The increase in noninterest income 
was primarily driven by growth in mortgage banking revenue, 
payment services revenue, trust and investment management 
fees, and commercial products revenue, partially offset by a 
decrease in deposit service charges, driven by the sale of the 
Company’s ATM third-party processing business in late 2018. 
Noninterest expense in 2019 was $321 million (2.6 percent) 

higher than 2018, primarily due to an increase in personnel 
expense, reflecting the impact of hiring to support business 
growth and higher fee revenue production in mortgage activities, 
and higher technology and communications expense and net 
occupancy and equipment expense, both in support of business 
growth. Partially offsetting these increases was lower other 
noninterest expense driven by lower Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (“FDIC”) assessment costs. 

Statement of Income Analysis 
Net Interest Income Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, was $13.2 billion in 2019, compared with 
$13.0 billion in 2018. The $120 million (0.9 percent) increase in 
net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in 2019 
compared with 2018, was principally driven by earning assets 
growth and higher yields on reinvestment of securities, partially 
offset by declining interest rates and a flatter yield curve, as well 
as changes in deposit and funding mix. Average earning assets 
were $15.5 billion (3.7 percent) higher in 2019, compared with 
2018, driven by increases in loans, investment securities and 
other earning assets. The net interest margin, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, in 2019 was 3.06 percent, compared with 
3.14 percent in 2018. The decrease in the net interest margin in 
2019, compared with 2018, was primarily due to the impacts of 
changes in the yield curve in addition to changes in deposit and 
funding mix. Refer to the “Interest Rate Risk Management” 
section for further information on the sensitivity of the Company’s 
net interest income to changes in interest rates. 

Average total loans were $290.7 billion in 2019, compared 

with $280.7 billion in 2018. The $10.0 billion (3.6 percent) 
increase was driven by growth in residential mortgages, 
commercial loans, credit card loans and other retail loans, 
partially offset by a decrease in commercial real estate loans and 
the fourth quarter of 2018 sale of the majority of the Company’s 
loans covered by FDIC loss-sharing agreements. Subsequent to 
the sale in the fourth quarter of 2018, any remaining covered loan 
balances were reclassified to their respective portfolio category. 
Average residential mortgages increased $5.9 billion (9.5 percent) 
as origination activity more than offset customers paying down 
balances. The $4.3 billion (4.4 percent) increase in average 
commercial loans was driven by higher demand for loans from 
new and existing customers. Average credit card balances 
increased $1.6 billion (7.6 percent) due to new and existing 
customer growth. The $910 million (1.6 percent) increase in 
average other retail loans was primarily due to higher installment, 
auto and retail leasing loans, partially offset by decreases in home 
equity loans and revolving credit balances. Average commercial 
real estate loans decreased $591 million (1.5 percent) in 2019, 
compared with 2018, due to new originations being more than 
offset by customers paying down balances and prudent credit 
underwriting, given the later stage of the business cycle.

(a)  Interest and rates are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis based on federal income tax rates of 21 percent for 2019 and 2018, and 35 percent for 2017. 
(b)  See Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 62. 
(c)  Excludes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investment securities and any premiums or discounts recorded related to the transfer of investment securities at fair value from 

available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. 

Average investment securities in 2019 were $3.2 billion (2.8 

percent) higher than in 2018, primarily due to purchases of 
mortgage-backed securities, net of prepayments and maturities. 

Average total deposits for 2019 were $13.4 billion (4.0 
percent) higher than 2018. Average total savings deposits for 
2019 were $11.9 billion (5.5 percent) higher than 2018, driven by 
increases in Wealth Management and Investment Services, 
Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Consumer and 
Business Banking balances. Average time deposits for 2019 were 
$5.8 billion (14.9 percent) higher than 2018. The increase was 

primarily related to those deposits managed as an alternative to 
other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing and 
liquidity characteristics, in addition to the migration of consumer 
customer deposit balances to higher yielding products. Average 
noninterest-bearing deposits were $4.3 billion (5.5 percent) lower 
in 2019, compared with 2018, primarily due to the migration of 
balances to interest-bearing deposits and the continued 
deployment by customers of business deposits within Corporate 
and Commercial Banking.

(a)  This table shows the components of the change in net interest income by volume and rate on a taxable-equivalent basis based on federal income tax rates of 21 percent for 2019 and 2018,  

and 35 percent for 2017. This table does not take into account the level of noninterest-bearing funding, nor does it fully reflect changes in the mix of assets and liabilities. The change in interest  
not solely due to changes in volume or rates has been allocated on a pro-rata basis to volume and yield/rate.  

Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses 
reflects changes in the size and credit quality of the entire 
portfolio of loans. The Company maintains an allowance for credit 
losses considered appropriate by management for probable and 
estimable losses, based on factors discussed in the “Analysis and 
Determination of Allowance for Credit Losses” section. 

In 2019, the provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion, 

compared with $1.4 billion in 2018. The provision for credit losses 
was higher than net charge-offs by $50 million and $25 million in 
2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the allowance for 
credit losses during 2019 reflected loan portfolio growth. Net 
charge-offs increased $100 million (7.4 percent) in 2019, 
compared with 2018, primarily due to higher credit card, 

commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs, 
partially offset by lower residential mortgage loan net charge-offs. 
Nonperforming assets decreased $160 million (16.2 percent) 
from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019, primarily driven 
by improvements in nonperforming residential mortgages, 
commercial real estate loans, other retail loans, and other real 
estate owned (“OREO”). 

Refer to “Corporate Risk Profile” for further information on the 
provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets 
and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the 
credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance 
for credit losses.

Noninterest Income Noninterest income in 2019 was 
$9.8 billion, compared with $9.6 billion in 2018. The $229 million 
(2.4 percent) increase in 2019 over 2018 reflected growth in 
mortgage banking revenue, payment services revenue, trust and 
investment management fees, commercial products revenue and 
other noninterest income, partially offset by a decline in deposit 
service charges. Mortgage banking revenue increased 
21.4 percent in 2019, compared with 2018, driven by higher 
mortgage production and gain on sale margins, partially offset by 
changes in mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) valuations, net of 
hedging activities. Payment services revenue was higher in 2019, 
compared with 2018, due to a 0.9 percent increase in credit and 
debit card revenue, a 3.1 percent increase in corporate payment 
products revenue and a 4.6 percent increase in merchant 
processing services revenue, all driven by higher sales volumes. 
Trust and investment management fees increased 3.3 percent 
due to business growth and favorable market conditions. 
Commercial products revenue increased 4.4 percent primarily 
due to higher corporate bond fees and trading revenue related to 

TABLE 5  Noninterest Expense 

stronger capital markets activities. Other noninterest income 
increased 1.8 percent in 2019, compared with 2018, primarily 
due to higher transition services agreement revenue associated 
with the sale of the Company’s ATM third-party servicing 
business in 2018, a 2019 gain on the sale of a loan portfolio and 
higher equity investment income, partially offset by a 2019 charge 
of $140 million for an increased derivative liability related to Visa 
shares previously sold by the Company and the 2018 net impact 
of the $340 million gain recorded from the sale of the ATM third-
party servicing business and $264 million of asset impairment 
charges related to the sale of a majority of the Company’s 
covered loans and certain other assets. The change in value of 
the derivative liability related to the Visa shares reflected 
judgement as to the estimated resolution date of the Visa litigation 
discussed in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Deposit service charges decreased 15.0 percent in 
2019, compared with 2018, primarily due to the ATM third-party 
servicing business sale.

Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense in 2019 was 
$12.8 billion, compared with $12.5 billion in 2018. The Company’s 
efficiency ratio was 55.8 percent in 2019, compared with 
55.1 percent in 2018. The $321 million (2.6 percent) increase in 
noninterest expense in 2019 over 2018 reflected higher personnel 
expense, technology and communications expense, net 
occupancy and equipment expense, and professional services 
expense, partially offset by lower other noninterest expense. 
Compensation expense increased 2.6 percent in 2019 over 2018, 
principally due to the impact of hiring to support business growth, 
merit increases and higher variable compensation related to 
business production within mortgage banking, while employee 
benefits expense increased 4.5 percent primarily due to increased 
medical costs. Technology and communications expense 
increased 12.0 percent and net occupancy and equipment 
expense increased 5.6 percent, primarily to support business 
growth. Professional services expense increased 11.5 percent 
primarily due to business investments and enhancements to risk 
management programs. Other noninterest expense decreased 
5.3 percent in 2019, compared with 2018, due to lower FDIC 
assessment costs driven by the elimination of the surcharge in late 
2018, and lower costs related to tax-advantaged projects. These 
decreases in other noninterest expense were partially offset by the 
net impact of $200 million of severance charges and asset 
impairment accruals recorded in 2019, and $174 million of 
severance charges and legal matter accruals recorded in 2018. 

Pension Plans Because of the long-term nature of pension 
plans, the related accounting is complex and can be impacted by 
several factors, including investment funding policies, accounting 
methods and actuarial assumptions. 

The Company’s pension accounting reflects the long-term 
nature of the benefit obligations and the investment horizon of 
plan assets. Amounts recorded in the financial statements reflect 
actuarial assumptions about participant benefits and plan asset 
returns. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences in 
actual plan experience, compared with actuarial assumptions, are 
deferred and recognized in expense in future periods. 

Pension expense is expected to increase by approximately 

$45 million in 2020 primarily due to a lower discount rate. 
Because of the complexity of forecasting pension plan activities, 
the accounting methods utilized for pension plans, the 
Company’s ability to respond to factors affecting the plans and 
the hypothetical nature of actuarial assumptions, the actual 
pension expense increase may differ from the expected amount. 
Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for further information on the Company’s pension 
plan funding practices, investment policies and asset allocation 
strategies, and accounting policies for pension plans. 

The following table shows the effect of hypothetical changes in 
the discount rate and long-term rate of return (“LTROR”) on the 
Company’s expected 2020 pension expense:

Income Tax Expense The provision for income taxes was 
$1.6 billion (an effective rate of 19.2 percent) in 2019, compared 
with $1.6 billion (an effective rate of 17.9 percent) in 2018. In late 
2017, tax reform was enacted that, among other provisions, 
reduced the federal statutory rate for corporations from 
35 percent to 21 percent effective in 2018. The Company 
revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 
2017 resulting in the recording of a deferred tax benefit in the 
provision for income taxes in 2017. The 2018 provision for 
income taxes reflected the currently effective statutory rate and 
the favorable impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities

Balance Sheet Analysis 
Average earning assets were $430.5 billion in 2019, compared 
with $415.1 billion in 2018. The increase in average earning 
assets of $15.4 billion (3.7 percent) was primarily due to 
increases in loans of $10.0 billion (3.6 percent), investment 
securities of $3.2 billion (2.8 percent) and other earning assets of 
$1.7 billion (10.1 percent). 

For average balance information, refer to Consolidated Daily 
Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates on pages 
144 and 145. 

Loans The Company’s loan portfolio was $296.1 billion at 
December 31, 2019, compared with $286.8 billion at 
December 31, 2018, an increase of $9.3 billion (3.2 percent). The 
increase was driven by increases in residential mortgages of 
$5.6 billion (8.5 percent), credit card loans of $1.4 billion 
(6.1 percent), commercial loans of $1.4 billion (1.4 percent), other 
retail loans of $688 million (1.2 percent) and commercial real 
estate loans of $207 million (0.5 percent). Table 6 provides a 
summary of the loan distribution by product type, while Table 12 
provides a summary of the selected loan maturity distribution by 
loan category. Average total loans increased $10.0 billion 
(3.6 percent) in 2019, compared with 2018. The increase was 
due to growth in most loan portfolio categories in 2019. 

Commercial Commercial loans, including lease financing, 
increased $1.4 billion (1.4 percent) at December 31, 2019, 
compared with December 31, 2018. Average commercial loans 

28 

increased $4.3 billion (4.4 percent) in 2019, compared with 2018. 
The growth was primarily driven by higher demand from new and 
existing customers. Table 7 provides a summary of commercial 
loans by industry and geographical location. 

Commercial Real Estate The Company’s portfolio of 
commercial real estate loans, which includes commercial 
mortgages and construction and development loans, increased 
$207 million (0.5 percent) at December 31, 2019, compared with 
December 31, 2018, primarily the result of new originations, 
partially offset by customers paying down balances. Average 
commercial real estate loans decreased $591 million 
(1.5 percent) in 2019, compared with 2018. Table 8 provides a 
summary of commercial real estate loans by property type and 
geographical location. 

The Company reclassifies construction loans to the 

commercial mortgage category if permanent financing criteria are 

TABLE 6  Loan Portfolio Distribution 

met. In 2019, approximately $493 million of construction loans 
were reclassified to the commercial mortgage category. At 
December 31, 2019 and 2018, $101 million and $130 million, 
respectively, of tax-exempt industrial development loans were 
secured by real estate. The Company’s commercial mortgage 
and construction and development loans had unfunded 
commitments of $11.3 billion and $10.3 billion at December 31, 
2019 and 2018, respectively. 

The Company also finances the operations of real estate 
developers and other entities with operations related to real 
estate. These loans are not secured directly by real estate but 
have similar characteristics to commercial real estate loans. 
These loans were included in the commercial loan category and 
totaled $9.5 billion and $9.8 billion at December 31, 2019 and 
2018, respectively.

The Company generally retains portfolio loans through 

maturity; however, the Company’s intent may change over time 
based upon various factors such as ongoing asset/liability 
management activities, assessment of product profitability, credit 
risk, liquidity needs, and capital implications. If the Company’s 
intent or ability to hold an existing portfolio loan changes, it is 
transferred to loans held for sale. 

Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale, consisting primarily of 
residential mortgages to be sold in the secondary market, were 

$5.6 billion at December 31, 2019, compared with $2.1 billion at 
December 31, 2018. The increase in loans held for sale was 
principally due to a higher level of mortgage loan closings in late 
2019, compared with the same period of 2018, reflecting the 
impact of declining interest rates. Almost all of the residential 
mortgage loans the Company originates or purchases for sale 
follow guidelines that allow the loans to be sold into existing, 
highly liquid secondary markets; in particular in government 
agency transactions and to government sponsored enterprises 
(“GSEs”).

(a)  Information related to asset and mortgage-backed securities included above is presented based upon weighted-average maturities that take into account anticipated future prepayments. 
(b)  Information related to obligations of state and political subdivisions is presented based upon yield to first optional call date if the security is purchased at a premium, and yield to maturity if the 

security is purchased at par or a discount. 

(c)  Maturity calculations for obligations of state and political subdivisions are based on the first optional call date for securities with a fair value above par and the contractual maturity date for 

securities with a fair value equal to or below par. 

(d)  At December 31, 2019, all investment securities were classified as available-for-sale. At December 31, 2018, total investment securities included held-to-maturity investment securities with a 
total amortized cost and fair value of $46.0 billion and $45.0 billion, respectively, and available-for-sale investment securities with a total amortized cost and fair value of $67.4 billion and 
$66.1 billion, respectively. Held-to-maturity investment securities are carried at historical cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Available-for-sale investment 
securities are carried at fair value with unrealized net gains or losses reported within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity. 

(e)  Weighted-average yields for obligations of state and political subdivisions are presented on a fully-taxable equivalent basis based on a federal income tax rate of 21 percent. Yields on 
investment securities are computed based on amortized cost balances, excluding any premiums or discounts recorded related to the transfer of investment securities at fair value from 
available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. 

Investment Securities The Company uses its investment 
securities portfolio to manage interest rate risk, provide liquidity 
(including the ability to meet regulatory requirements), generate 
interest and dividend income, and as collateral for public deposits 
and wholesale funding sources. While the Company intends to 
hold its investment securities indefinitely, it may sell 
available-for-sale securities in response to structural changes in 
the balance sheet and related interest rate risk and to meet 
liquidity requirements, among other factors. 

Investment securities totaled $122.6 billion at December 31, 
2019, compared with $112.2 billion at December 31, 2018. The 
$10.4 billion (9.3 percent) increase reflected $8.7 billion of net 
investment purchases and a $1.8 billion favorable change in net 
unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investment 
securities. On December 31, 2019, the Company transferred all 
$43.6 billion of its held-to-maturity investment securities to the 
available-for-sale category to reflect its new intent for these 
securities, as a result of changes to regulatory capital 
requirements promulgated in 2019. 

Average investment securities were $117.2 billion in 2019, 
compared with $113.9 billion in 2018. The weighted-average 
yield of the investment securities portfolio was 2.38 percent at 
December 31, 2019, compared with 2.52 percent at 
December 31, 2018. The weighted-average maturity of the 
investment securities portfolio was 4.2 years at December 31, 
2019, compared with 5.3 years at December 31, 2018. 
Investment securities by type are shown in Table 13. 

The Company’s available-for-sale securities are carried at fair 
value with changes in fair value reflected in other comprehensive 
income (loss) unless a security is deemed to be other-than­
temporarily impaired. At December 31, 2019, the Company’s net 
unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities were $496 million, 
compared with $1.3 billion of net unrealized losses at 
December 31, 2018. The favorable change in net unrealized 
gains (losses) was primarily due to increases in the fair value of 
U.S. Treasury, mortgage-backed and state and political securities 
as a result of changes in interest rates. Gross unrealized losses 
on available-for-sale securities totaled $448 million at 
December 31, 2019, compared with $1.4 billion at December 31, 
2018. The Company conducts a regular assessment of its 
investment portfolio to determine whether any securities are 
other-than-temporarily impaired. When assessing unrealized 
losses for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company 
considers the nature of the investment, the financial condition of 
the issuer, the extent and duration of unrealized losses, expected 
cash flows of underlying assets and market conditions. At 
December 31, 2019, the Company had no plans to sell securities 
with unrealized losses, and believes it is more likely than not that 
it would not be required to sell such securities before recovery of 
their amortized cost.

Financial Statements for further information on investment 
securities.

Deposits Total deposits were $361.9 billion at December 31, 
2019, compared with $345.5 billion at December 31, 2018. The 
$16.4 billion (4.8 percent) increase in total deposits reflected an 
increase in total savings deposits, partially offset by decreases in 
noninterest-bearing and time deposits. Average total deposits in 
2019 increased $13.4 billion (4.0 percent) over 2018. 

Interest-bearing savings deposits increased $24.3 billion 

(11.1 percent) at December 31, 2019, compared with 
December 31, 2018. The increase was related to higher money 
market, savings account and interest checking account deposit 
balances. Money market deposit balances increased $19.7 billion 
(19.6 percent), primarily due to higher Wealth Management and 
Investment Services, and Corporate and Commercial Banking 
balances. Savings account balances increased $2.7 billion (6.0 
percent), primarily due to higher Consumer and Business Banking 
balances. Interest checking balances increased $2.0 billion 
(2.6 percent) primarily due to higher Consumer and Business 
Banking, and Corporate and Commercial Banking balances, 
partially offset by lower Wealth Management and Investment 
Services balances. Average interest-bearing savings deposits in 
2019 increased $11.9 billion (5.5 percent), compared with 2018, 
reflecting higher Wealth Management and Investment Services, 
Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Consumer and 
Business Banking balances. 

Noninterest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2019, 
decreased $6.2 billion (7.6 percent) from December 31, 2018. 
Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $4.3 billion 
(5.5 percent) in 2019, compared with 2018. The decreases were 

primarily due to lower Wealth Management and Investment 
Services, and Corporate and Commercial Banking balances, 
resulting primarily from balance migration to interest-bearing 
deposits and continued deployment of deposits by customers. 
Interest-bearing time deposits at December 31, 2019, 

decreased $1.7 billion (3.7 percent), compared with 
December 31, 2018. Average time deposits increased $5.8 billion 
(14.9 percent) in 2019, compared with 2018. The changes were 
primarily driven by those deposits managed as an alternative to 
other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing and 
liquidity characteristics, as well as the migration of consumer 
customer deposit balances to higher yielding products. 

Borrowings The Company utilizes both short-term and long­
term borrowings as part of its asset/liability management and 
funding strategies. Short-term borrowings, which include federal 
funds purchased, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, 
borrowings secured by high-grade assets and other short-term 
borrowings, were $23.7 billion at December 31, 2019, compared 
with $14.1 billion at December 31, 2018. The $9.6 billion 
(67.8 percent) increase in short-term borrowings was primarily 
due to higher commercial paper, federal funds purchased and 
other short-term borrowings balances, partially offset by lower 
repurchase agreement balances. 

Long-term debt was $40.2 billion at December 31, 2019, 

compared with $41.3 billion at December 31, 2018. The 
$1.1 billion (2.8 percent) decrease was primarily due to 
$8.0 billion of bank note repayments and maturities, and 
$1.5 billion of medium-term note repayments, partially offset by 

35 

issuances of $4.8 billion of bank notes, $2.7 billion of medium-
term notes and $1.0 billion of subordinated notes. 

Refer to Notes 12 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements for additional information regarding short-
term borrowings and long-term debt, and the “Liquidity Risk 
Management” section for discussion of liquidity management of 
the Company. 

Corporate Risk Profile 
Overview Managing risks is an essential part of successfully 
operating a financial services company. The Company’s Board of 
Directors has approved a risk management framework which 
establishes governance and risk management requirements for all 
risk-taking activities. This framework includes Company and 
business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for 
the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing 
business objectives and initiatives. The Board of Directors, 
primarily through its Risk Management Committee, oversees 
performance relative to the risk management framework, risk 
appetite statements, and other policy requirements. 

The Executive Risk Committee (“ERC”), which is chaired by 
the Chief Risk Officer and includes the Chief Executive Officer and 
other members of the executive management team, oversees 
execution against the risk management framework and risk 
appetite statements. The ERC focuses on current and emerging 
risks, including strategic and reputation risks, by directing timely 
and comprehensive actions. Senior operating committees have 
also been established, each responsible for overseeing a 
specified category of risk. 

The Company’s most prominent risk exposures are credit, 
interest rate, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic, 
and reputation. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest 
and/or the principal balance of a loan, investment or derivative 
contract when it is due. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction 
of net interest income or market valuations as a result of changes 
in interest rates. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest 
rates, foreign exchange rates, and security prices that may result 
in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as trading 
and available-for-sale securities, mortgage loans held for sale 
(“MLHFS”), MSRs and derivatives that are accounted for on a fair 
value basis. Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations 
or new business at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. 
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed 
internal processes or systems, people, or adverse external events, 
including the risk of loss resulting from breaches in data security. 
Operational risk can also include the risk of loss due to failures by 
third parties with which the Company does business. Compliance 
risk is the risk that the Company may suffer legal or regulatory 
sanctions, material financial loss, or loss to reputation through 
failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, standards of good 
practice, and codes of conduct. Strategic risk is the risk to current 
or projected financial condition arising from adverse business 
decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of 
responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating 

environment. Reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated 
earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from 
negative public opinion. This risk may impair the Company’s 
competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish new customer 
relationships, offer new services or continue serving existing 
customer relationships. In addition to the risks identified above, 
other risk factors exist that may impact the Company. Refer to 
“Risk Factors” beginning on page 146, for a detailed discussion of 
these factors. 

The Company’s Board and management-level governance 
committees are supported by a “three lines of defense” model for 
establishing effective checks and balances. The first line of 
defense, the business lines, manages risks in conformity with 
established limits and policy requirements. In turn, business line 
leaders and their risk officers establish programs to ensure 
conformity with these limits and policy requirements. The second 
line of defense, which includes the Chief Risk Officer’s organization 
as well as policy and oversight activities of corporate support 
functions, translates risk appetite and strategy into actionable risk 
limits and policies. The second line of defense monitors first line of 
defense conformity with limits and policies, and provides reporting 
and escalation of emerging risks and other concerns to senior 
management and the Risk Management Committee of the Board 
of Directors. The third line of defense, internal audit, is responsible 
for providing the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and 
senior management with independent assessment and assurance 
regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s governance, risk 
management and control processes. 

Management regularly provides reports to the Risk 
Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk 
Management Committee discusses with management the 
Company’s risk management performance, and provides a 
summary of key risks to the entire Board of Directors, covering 
the status of existing matters, areas of potential future concern 
and specific information on certain types of loss events. The Risk 
Management Committee considers quarterly reports by 
management assessing the Company’s performance relative to 
the risk appetite statements and the associated risk limits, 
including: 

– Macroeconomic environment and other qualitative 

considerations, such as regulatory and compliance changes, 
litigation developments, and technology and cybersecurity; 
– Credit measures, including adversely rated and nonperforming 

loans, leveraged transactions, credit concentrations and lending 
limits; 

– Interest rate and market risk, including market value and net 
income simulation, and trading-related Value at Risk (“VaR”); 

– Liquidity risk, including funding projections under various 

stressed scenarios; 

– Operational and compliance risk, including losses stemming 

from events such as fraud, processing errors, control breaches, 
breaches in data security or adverse business decisions, as well 
as reporting on technology performance, and various legal and 
regulatory compliance measures; 

36 

– Capital ratios and projections, including regulatory measures 

and stressed scenarios; and 

– Strategic and reputation risk considerations, impacts and 

responses. 

Credit Risk Management The Company’s strategy for credit 
risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit 
policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk monitoring 
and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit 
exposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a 
geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit 
examinations and management reviews of loans exhibiting 
deterioration of credit quality. The Risk Management Committee 
oversees the Company’s credit risk management process. 

In addition, credit quality ratings as defined by the Company, 

are an important part of the Company’s overall credit risk 
management and evaluation of its allowance for credit losses. 
Loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on 
the Company’s rating scale for problem credits, as minimal risk 
has been identified. Loans with a special mention or classified 
rating, including loans that are 90 days or more past due and still 
accruing, nonaccrual loans, those loans considered troubled debt 
restructurings (“TDRs”), and loans in a junior lien position that are 
current but are behind a modified or delinquent loan in a first lien 
position, encompass all loans held by the Company that it 
considers to have a potential or well-defined weakness that may 
put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk. The 
Company’s internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are 
primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming status, except 
for a limited population of larger loans within those portfolios that 
are individually evaluated. For this limited population, the 
determination of the internal credit quality rating may also 
consider collateral value and customer cash flows. The Company 
strives to identify potential problem loans early, record any 
necessary charge-offs promptly and maintain appropriate 
allowance levels for probable loan losses. Refer to Notes 1 and 5 
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further 
discussion of the Company’s loan portfolios including internal 
credit quality ratings. 

The Company categorizes its loan portfolio into two 

segments, which is the level at which it develops and documents 
a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit 
losses. The Company’s two loan portfolio segments are 
commercial lending and consumer lending. 

The commercial lending segment includes loans and leases 

made to small business, middle market, large corporate, 
commercial real estate, financial institution, non-profit and public 
sector customers. Key risk characteristics relevant to commercial 
lending segment loans include the industry and geography of the 
borrower’s business, purpose of the loan, repayment source, 
borrower’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, loan covenants, 
and nature of pledged collateral, if any. These risk characteristics, 
among others, are considered in determining estimates about the 
likelihood of default by the borrowers and the severity of loss in 
the event of default. The Company considers these risk 

characteristics in assigning internal risk ratings to, or forecasting 
losses on, these loans, which are the significant factors in 
determining the allowance for credit losses for loans in the 
commercial lending segment. 

The consumer lending segment represents loans and leases 
made to consumer customers, including residential mortgages, 
credit card loans, and other retail loans such as revolving 
consumer lines, auto loans and leases, home equity loans and 
lines, and student loans, a run-off portfolio. Home equity or 
second mortgage loans are junior lien closed-end accounts fully 
disbursed at origination. These loans typically are fixed rate loans, 
secured by residential real estate, with a 10- or 15-year fixed 
payment amortization schedule. Home equity lines are revolving 
accounts giving the borrower the ability to draw and repay 
balances repeatedly, up to a maximum commitment, and are 
secured by residential real estate. These include accounts in 
either a first or junior lien position. Typical terms on home equity 
lines in the portfolio are variable rates benchmarked to the prime 
rate, with a 10- or 15-year draw period during which a minimum 
payment is equivalent to the monthly interest, followed by a 20­
or 10-year amortization period, respectively. At December 31, 
2019, substantially all of the Company’s home equity lines were 
in the draw period. Approximately $1.3 billion, or 10 percent, of 
the outstanding home equity line balances at December 31, 
2019, will enter the amortization period within the next 36 
months. Key risk characteristics relevant to consumer lending 
segment loans primarily relate to the borrowers’ capacity and 
willingness to repay and include unemployment rates and other 
economic factors, customer payment history and credit scores, 
and in some cases, updated loan-to-value (“LTV”) information 
reflecting current market conditions on real estate-based loans. 
These risk characteristics, among others, are reflected in 
forecasts of delinquency levels, bankruptcies and losses which 
are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit 
losses for the consumer lending segment. 

The Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio 
segments into various classes based on their underlying risk 
characteristics. The two classes within the commercial lending 
segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. 
The three classes within the consumer lending segment are 
residential mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans. 

Because business processes and credit risks associated with 

unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for 
loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its 
liability for unfunded credit commitments. The Company also 
engages in non-lending activities that may give rise to credit risk, 
including derivative transactions for balance sheet hedging 
purposes, foreign exchange transactions, deposit overdrafts and 
interest rate contracts for customers, investments in securities 
and other financial assets, and settlement risk, including 
Automated Clearing House transactions and the processing of 
credit card transactions for merchants. These activities are 
subject to credit review, analysis and approval processes. 

Economic and Other Factors In evaluating its credit risk, the 
Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting activities, the 

37 

loan portfolio composition (including product mix and geographic, 
industry or customer-specific concentrations), collateral values, 
trends in loan performance and macroeconomic factors, such as 
changes in unemployment rates, gross domestic product and 
consumer bankruptcy filings, as well as the potential impact on 
customers and the domestic economy resulting from new tariffs 
or increases in existing tariffs. 

During 2019, domestic economic conditions continued to be 

favorable as evidenced by overall growth and a strong labor 
market with the lowest unemployment rate in decades, despite 
the challenging headwinds created by trade conflict and slowing 
global growth. The domestic economy has experienced 
moderate productivity growth over the past few years supported 
by strong consumer spending, although business investment 
remains muted due to weak foreign growth and domestic trade 
policies. In an effort to reduce the impact of these risks to the 
domestic economy, the Federal Reserve Bank decreased short-
term interest rates during 2019. Although the domestic economy 
is expected to grow at a modest pace in the next year, supported 
by strong consumer confidence and a healthy job market, 
uncertainty remains of the impact resulting from new tariffs, 
increases in existing tariffs, or future changes in interest rates or 
other domestic economic or trade policies. Current or anticipated 
changes to these policies that lessen their expansionary effect on 
the domestic economy could slow or further slow the expansion 
of the domestic and global economies. 

Credit Diversification The Company manages its credit risk, in 
part, through diversification of its loan portfolio which is achieved 
through limit setting by product type criteria, such as industry, 
and identification of credit concentrations. As part of its normal 
business activities, the Company offers a broad array of 
traditional commercial lending products and specialized products 
such as asset-based lending, commercial lease financing, 
agricultural credit, warehouse mortgage lending, small business 
lending, commercial real estate lending, health care lending and 
correspondent banking financing. The Company also offers an 
array of consumer lending products, including residential 
mortgages, credit card loans, auto loans, retail leases, home 
equity loans and lines, revolving credit arrangements and other 
consumer loans. These consumer lending products are primarily 
offered through the branch office network, home mortgage and 
loan production offices, mobile and on-line banking, and indirect 
distribution channels, such as auto dealers. The Company 
monitors and manages the portfolio diversification by industry, 
customer and geography. Table 6 provides information with 
respect to the overall product diversification and changes in the 
mix during 2019. 

The commercial loan class is diversified among various 
industries with higher concentrations in manufacturing, finance 
and insurance, wholesale trade, retail trade, and real estate, rental 
and leasing. Additionally, the commercial loan class is diversified 
across the Company’s geographical markets with 61.4 percent of 
total commercial loans within the Company’s Consumer and 
Business Banking region. Credit relationships outside of the 
Company’s Consumer and Business Banking region relate to the 

corporate banking, mortgage banking, auto dealer and leasing 
businesses, focusing on large national customers and specifically 
targeted industries, such as healthcare, utilities, energy and public 
administration. Loans to mortgage banking customers are 
primarily warehouse lines which are collateralized with the 
underlying mortgages. The Company regularly monitors its 
mortgage collateral position to manage its risk exposure. Table 7 
provides a summary of significant industry groups and 
geographical locations of commercial loans outstanding at 
December 31, 2019 and 2018. 

The commercial real estate loan class reflects the Company’s 
focus on serving business owners within its geographic footprint 
as well as regional and national investment-based real estate 
owners and builders. Within the commercial real estate loan 
class, different property types have varying degrees of credit risk. 
Table 8 provides a summary of the significant property types and 
geographical locations of commercial real estate loans 
outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018. At December 31, 
2019, approximately 22.9 percent of the commercial real estate 
loans represented business owner-occupied properties that tend 
to exhibit less credit risk than non owner-occupied properties. 
The investment-based real estate mortgages are diversified 
among various property types with somewhat higher 
concentrations in multi-family, office and retail properties. From a 
geographical perspective, the Company’s commercial real estate 
loan class is generally well diversified. However, at December 31, 
2019, 25.1 percent of the Company’s commercial real estate 
loans were secured by collateral in California, which has 
historically experienced higher credit quality deterioration in 
recessionary periods due to excess inventory levels and declining 
valuations. Included in commercial real estate at year-end 2019 
was approximately $407 million in loans related to land held for 
development and $433 million of loans related to residential and 
commercial acquisition and development properties. These loans 
are subject to quarterly monitoring for changes in local market 
conditions due to a higher credit risk profile. The commercial real 
estate loan class is diversified across the Company’s 
geographical markets with 83.5 percent of total commercial real 
estate loans outstanding at December 31, 2019, within the 
Company’s Consumer and Business Banking region. 

The Company’s consumer lending segment utilizes several 
distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer 
credit, including traditional branch lending, mobile and on-line 
banking, indirect lending, correspondent banks and loan brokers. 
Each distinct underwriting and origination activity manages 
unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production 
commensurate with the differing risk profiles. 

Residential mortgage originations are generally limited to 
prime borrowers and are performed through the Company’s 
branches, loan production offices, mobile and on-line services, 
and a wholesale network of originators. The Company may retain 
residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell 
the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing 
rights and customer relationships. Utilizing the secondary markets 
enables the Company to effectively reduce its credit and other 

38 

asset/liability risks. For residential mortgages that are retained in 
the Company’s portfolio and for home equity and second 
mortgages, credit risk is also diversified by geography and 
managed by adherence to LTV and borrower credit criteria during 
the underwriting process. 

The Company estimates updated LTV information on its 
outstanding residential mortgages quarterly, based on a method 
that combines automated valuation model updates and relevant 
home price indices. LTV is the ratio of the loan’s outstanding 
principal balance to the current estimate of property value. For 
home equity and second mortgages, combined loan-to-value 
(“CLTV”) is the combination of the first mortgage original principal 
balance and the second lien outstanding principal balance, 
relative to the current estimate of property value. Certain loans do 
not have a LTV or CLTV, primarily due to lack of availability of 
relevant automated valuation model and/or home price indices 
values, or lack of necessary valuation data on acquired loans. 

The following tables provide summary information of residential 
mortgages and home equity and second mortgages by LTV and 
borrower type at December 31, 2019:

Home equity and second mortgages were $15.0 billion at 

December 31, 2019, compared with $16.1 billion at 
December 31, 2018, and included $3.8 billion of home equity 
lines in a first lien position and $11.2 billion of home equity and 
second mortgage loans and lines in a junior lien position. Loans 
and lines in a junior lien position at December 31, 2019, included 
approximately $4.5 billion of loans and lines for which the 
Company also serviced the related first lien loan, and 
approximately $6.7 billion where the Company did not service the 
related first lien loan. The Company was able to determine the 
status of the related first liens using information the Company has 
as the servicer of the first lien or information reported on 
customer credit bureau files. The Company also evaluates other 
indicators of credit risk for these junior lien loans and lines, 
including delinquency, estimated average CLTV ratios and 
updated weighted-average credit scores in making its 
assessment of credit risk, related loss estimates and determining 
the allowance for credit losses.

Credit card and other retail loans are diversified across 

customer segments and geographies. Diversification in the credit 
card portfolio is achieved with broad customer relationship 
distribution through the Company’s and financial institution 
partners’ branches, retail and affinity partners, and digital 
channels. 

Tables 9, 10 and 11 provide a geographical summary of the 
residential mortgage, credit card and other retail loan portfolios, 
respectively. 

Loan Delinquencies Trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator, 
among other considerations, of credit risk within the Company’s 
loan portfolios. The entire balance of a loan account is considered 
delinquent if the minimum payment contractually required to be 
made is not received by the date specified on the billing 
statement. The Company measures delinquencies, both including 
and excluding nonperforming loans, to enable comparability with 
other companies. Delinquent loans purchased from Government 
National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”) mortgage pools whose 
repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing 
Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of

(a)  Delinquent loan ratios exclude $1.7 billion, $1.7 billion, $1.9 billion, $2.5 billion, and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, of loans purchased from 
GNMA mortgage pools whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Including these 
loans, the ratio of residential mortgages 90 days or more past due including all nonperforming loans was 2.92 percent, 3.21 percent, 4.16 percent, 5.73 percent, and 7.15 percent at 
December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 

Veterans Affairs, are excluded from delinquency statistics. In 
addition, in certain situations, a consumer lending customer’s 
account may be re-aged to remove it from delinquent status. 
Generally, the purpose of re-aging accounts is to assist 
customers who have recently overcome temporary financial 
difficulties and have demonstrated both the ability and willingness 
to resume regular payments. To qualify for re-aging, the account 
must have been open for at least nine months and cannot have 
been re-aged during the preceding 365 days. An account may 
not be re-aged more than two times in a five-year period. To 
qualify for re-aging, the customer must also have made three 
regular minimum monthly payments within the last 90 days. In 
addition, the Company may re-age the consumer lending 
account of a customer who has experienced longer-term financial 
difficulties and apply modified, concessionary terms and 
conditions to the account. Such additional re-ages are limited to 

one in a five-year period and must meet the qualifications for 
re-aging described above. All re-aging strategies must be 
independently approved by the Company’s risk management 
department. Commercial lending loans are generally not subject 
to re-aging policies. 

Accruing loans 90 days or more past due totaled $605 million 

at December 31, 2019, compared with $584 million at 
December 31, 2018. Accruing loans 90 days or more past due 
are not included in nonperforming assets and continue to accrue 
interest because they are adequately secured by collateral, are in 
the process of collection and are reasonably expected to result in 
repayment or restoration to current status, or are managed in 
homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes 
adhering to regulatory guidelines. The ratio of accruing loans 
90 days or more past due to total loans was 0.20 percent at 
December 31, 2019, unchanged from December 31, 2018.

(a)  Excludes $428 million of loans 30-89 days past due and $1.7 billion of loans 90 days or 
more past due at December 31, 2019, purchased from GNMA mortgage pools that 
continue to accrue interest, compared with $430 million and $1.7 billion at December 31, 
2018, respectively. 

(b)  Includes revolving credit, installment, automobile and student loans. 

Restructured Loans In certain circumstances, the Company 
may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of 
amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties 
or is expected to experience difficulties in the near-term. In most 
cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in 
interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the 
principal balance that would otherwise not be considered. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings Concessionary modifications are 
classified as TDRs unless the modification results in only an 
insignificant delay in the payments to be received. TDRs accrue 
interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and 
conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a 
level commensurate with the modified terms over several 
payment cycles, which is generally six months or greater. At 

December 31, 2019, performing TDRs were $3.8 billion, 
compared with $3.9 billion, $4.0 billion, $4.2 billion and 
$4.7 billion at December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 
respectively. Loans classified as TDRs are considered impaired 
loans for reporting and measurement purposes. 

The Company continues to work with customers to modify 
loans for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. 
Many of the Company’s TDRs are determined on a case-by-case 
basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes. The 
modifications vary within each of the Company’s loan classes. 
Commercial lending segment TDRs generally include extensions 
of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or 
decrease to the interest rate. The Company may also work with 
the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate 
losses, such as obtaining additional collateral and/or guarantees 
to support the loan. 

The Company has also implemented certain residential 
mortgage loan restructuring programs that may result in TDRs. 
The Company modifies residential mortgage loans under Federal 
Housing Administration, United States Department of Veterans 
Affairs, and its own internal programs. Under these programs, the 
Company offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to 
permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable 
monthly payments by providing loan concessions. These 
concessions may include adjustments to interest rates, 
conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates, extensions of 
maturity dates or deferrals of payments, capitalization of accrued 
interest and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations, 
partial forgiveness of loan principal. In most instances, 
participation in residential mortgage loan restructuring programs 
requires the customer to complete a short-term trial period. A 
permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer 
successfully completing the trial period arrangement, and the loan 
documents are not modified until that time. The Company reports 
loans in a trial period arrangement as TDRs and continues to 
report them as TDRs after the trial period. 

Credit card and other retail loan TDRs are generally part of 
distinct restructuring programs providing customers modification 
solutions over a specified time period, generally up to 60 months. 

In accordance with regulatory guidance, the Company 

considers secured consumer loans that have had debt 
discharged through bankruptcy where the borrower has not 
reaffirmed the debt to be TDRs. If the loan amount exceeds the 
collateral value, the loan is charged down to collateral value and 
the remaining amount is reported as nonperforming. 

Acquired loans restructured after acquisition are not 

considered TDRs for purposes of the Company’s accounting and 
disclosure if the loans evidenced credit deterioration as of the 
acquisition date and are accounted for in pools.

(a)  Primarily represents loans less than six months from the modification date that have not met the performance period required to return to accrual status (generally six months) and small 

business credit cards with a modified rate equal to 0 percent. 

(b)  Primarily represents loans less than six months from the modification date that have not met the performance period required to return to accrual status (generally six months). 
(c)  Primarily represents loans with a modified rate equal to 0 percent. 
(d)  Includes $306 million of residential mortgage loans to borrowers that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy and $34 million in trial period arrangements or previously placed in trial 

period arrangements but not successfully completed. 

(e)  Includes $85 million of other retail loans to borrowers that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy and $17 million in trial period arrangements or previously placed in trial period 

(f)	 

arrangements but not successfully completed. 
Includes $137 million of Federal Housing Administration and United States Department of Veterans Affairs residential mortgage loans to borrowers that have had debt discharged through 
bankruptcy and $415 million in trial period arrangements or previously placed in trial period arrangements but not successfully completed. 

(g)  Approximately 6.9 percent and 47.3 percent of the total TDR loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools are 30-89 days past due and 90 days or more past due, respectively, but are not 

classified as delinquent as their repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. 

Short-term Modifications The Company makes short-term 
modifications that it does not consider to be TDRs, in limited 
circumstances, to assist borrowers experiencing temporary 
hardships. Consumer lending programs include payment 
reductions, deferrals of up to three past due payments, and the 
ability to return to current status if the borrower makes required 
payments. The Company may also make short-term 
modifications to commercial lending loans, with the most 
common modification being an extension of the maturity date of 
three months or less. Such extensions generally are used when 
the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is experiencing 
some level of financial stress, but the Company believes the 
borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed. Short-term 
modifications were not material at December 31, 2019. 

Nonperforming Assets The level of nonperforming assets 
represents another indicator of the potential for future credit 
losses. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, 
restructured loans not performing in accordance with modified 
terms and not accruing interest, restructured loans that have not 
met the performance period required to return to accrual status, 
OREO and other nonperforming assets owned by the Company. 

Interest payments collected from assets on nonaccrual status are 
generally applied against the principal balance and not recorded 
as income. However, interest income may be recognized for 
interest payments if the remaining carrying amount of the loan is 
believed to be collectible. 

At December 31, 2019, total nonperforming assets were 
$829 million, compared with $989 million at December 31, 2018. 
The $160 million (16.2 percent) decrease in nonperforming 
assets, from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019, was 
driven by improvements in nonperforming residential mortgages, 
commercial real estate loans, other retail loans and OREO. The 
ratio of total nonperforming assets to total loans and other real 
estate was 0.28 percent at December 31, 2019, compared with 
0.34 percent at December 31, 2018. 

OREO was $78 million at December 31, 2019, compared with 

$111 million at December 31, 2018, and was related to 
foreclosed properties that previously secured loan balances. 
These balances exclude foreclosed GNMA loans whose 
repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing 
Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of 
Veterans Affairs.

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-offs Total loan net charge-offs 
were $1.5 billion in 2019, compared with $1.4 billion in 2018. The 
$100 million (7.4 percent) increase in total net charge-offs in 
2019, compared with 2018, reflected higher credit card, 
commercial, and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs, 
partially offset by lower residential mortgage loan net charge-offs. 
The ratio of total loan net charge-offs to average loans 
outstanding was 0.50 percent in 2019, compared with 
0.48 percent in 2018. 

Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs 

for 2019 were $299 million (0.21 percent of average loans 
outstanding), compared with $232 million (0.17 percent of 
average loans outstanding) in 2018. The increase in net charge-
offs in 2019, compared with 2018, reflected higher commercial 
and commercial real estate loan charge-offs and lower 
commercial real estate loan recoveries. 

Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs for 2019 were 
$3 million, compared with $17 million (0.03 percent of average 
loans outstanding) in 2018. Credit card loan net charge-offs in 
2019 were $893 million (3.83 percent of average loans 
outstanding), compared with $846 million (3.90 percent of 
average loans outstanding) in 2018. Other retail loan net charge-
offs for 2019 were $259 million (0.45 percent of average loans 
outstanding), compared with $259 million (0.46 percent of 
average loans outstanding) in 2018. The increase in total 
residential mortgage, credit card and other retail loan net charge-
offs in 2019, compared with 2018, reflected higher credit card 
loan net charge-offs due to portfolio growth, partially offset by 
lower residential mortgage loan net charge-offs due to favorable 
economic conditions during 2019.

Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses 
Through December 31, 2019, the allowance for credit losses was 
established to reserve for probable and estimable losses incurred 
in the Company’s loan and lease portfolio, including unfunded 
credit commitments. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company 
adopted new accounting guidance which changes previous 
impairment recognition to a model that is based on expected 
losses rather than incurred losses. The allowance for credit losses 
is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced 
by net charge-offs. Management evaluates the appropriateness of 
the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis. The evaluation 
of each element and the overall allowance is based on a continuing 
assessment of problem loans, recent loss experience and other 
factors, including external factors such as regulatory guidance and 
economic conditions. Because business processes and credit risks 
associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the 
same as for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to 
estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments, which is 
included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both 
the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit 
commitments are included in the Company’s analysis of credit 
losses and reported reserve ratios. 

At December 31, 2019, the allowance for credit losses was 
$4.5 billion (1.52 percent of period-end loans), compared with an 
allowance of $4.4 billion (1.55 percent of period-end loans) at 
December 31, 2018. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to 
nonperforming loans was 649 percent at December 31, 2019, 
compared with 544 percent at December 31, 2018. The ratio of the 
allowance for credit losses to annual loan net charge-offs at 
December 31, 2019, was 309 percent, compared with 328 percent 
at December 31, 2018. Management determined the allowance for 
credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2019. 

The allowance recorded for loans in the commercial lending 
segment through December 31, 2019, was based on reviews of 
individual credit relationships and considered the migration 
analysis of commercial lending segment loans and actual loss 
experience. For each loan type, this historical loss experience 

was adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in 
portfolio composition, lending policies, underwriting standards, 
risk management practices or economic conditions. The results 
of the analysis were evaluated quarterly to confirm the selected 
loss experience was appropriate for each commercial loan type. 
The allowance recorded for impaired loans greater than $5 million 
in the commercial lending segment was based on an individual 
loan analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the 
original effective interest rate, the observable market price of the 
loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, for 
collateral-dependent loans, rather than the migration analysis. 
The allowance recorded for all other commercial lending segment 
loans was determined on a homogenous pool basis and included 
consideration of product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio, 
delinquency status, bankruptcy experience, portfolio growth and 
historical losses, adjusted for current trends. The allowance 
established for commercial lending segment loans was 
$2.3 billion at December 31, 2019 compared with $2.2 billion 
December 31, 2018, reflecting overall portfolio growth. 

The allowance recorded for TDR loans and purchased 
impaired loans in the consumer lending segment through 
December 31, 2019, was determined on a homogenous pool 
basis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original 
effective interest rate of the pool, or the prior quarter effective 
rate, respectively. The allowance for collateral-dependent loans in 
the consumer lending segment was determined based on the fair 
value of the collateral less costs to sell. The allowance recorded 
for all other consumer lending segment loans was determined on 
a homogenous pool basis and included consideration of product 
mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio, bankruptcy experience, 
delinquency status, refreshed LTV ratios when possible, portfolio 
growth and historical losses, adjusted for current trends. Credit 
card and other retail loans 90 days or more past due are 
generally not placed on nonaccrual status because of the 
relatively short period of time to charge-off and, therefore, were 
excluded from nonperforming loans and measures that include 
nonperforming loans as part of the calculation.

When evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for 
credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position, the 
Company considered the delinquency and modification status of 
the first lien. At December 31, 2019, the Company serviced the 
first lien on 40 percent of the home equity loans and lines in a 
junior lien position. The Company also considered information 
received from its primary regulator on the status of the first liens 
that were serviced by other large servicers in the industry and the 
status of first lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit 
bureau files. Regardless of whether or not the Company serviced 
the first lien, an assessment was made of economic conditions, 
problem loans, recent loss experience and other factors in 
determining the allowance for credit losses. Based on the 
available information, the Company estimated $273 million or 
1.8 percent of its total home equity portfolio at December 31, 
2019, represented non-delinquent junior liens where the first lien 
was delinquent or modified. 

The Company used historical loss experience on the loans 
and lines in a junior lien position where the first lien was serviced 
by the Company, or could be identified in credit bureau data, to 
establish loss estimates for junior lien loans and lines the 
Company serviced that were current, but the first lien was 
delinquent or modified. Historically, the number of junior lien 
defaults has been a small percentage of the total portfolio 
(approximately 1 percent annually), while the long-term average 
loss rate on loans that default has been approximately 
90 percent. In addition, the Company obtains updated credit 
scores on its home equity portfolio each quarter, and in some 
cases more frequently, and used this information to qualitatively 
supplement its loss estimation methods. Credit score 
distributions for the portfolio are monitored monthly and any 
changes in the distribution are one of the factors considered in 

assessing the Company’s loss estimates. In its evaluation of the 
allowance for credit losses, the Company also considered the 
increased risk of loss associated with home equity lines that are 
contractually scheduled to convert from a revolving status to a 
fully amortizing payment and with residential lines and loans that 
have a balloon payoff provision. 

The allowance established for consumer lending segment 
loans was $2.2 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, reflecting 
overall portfolio growth, partially offset by continued improvement 
in housing market conditions. 

In addition, through December 31, 2019, the evaluation of the 

appropriate allowance for credit losses on purchased 
non-impaired loans acquired after January 1, 2009, in the various 
loan segments considered credit discounts recorded as a part of 
the initial determination of the fair value of the loans. For these 
loans, no allowance for credit losses was recorded at the 
purchase date. Credit discounts representing the principal losses 
expected over the life of the loans were a component of the initial 
fair value. Subsequent to the purchase date, the methods utilized 
to estimate the required allowance for credit losses for these 
loans was similar to originated loans; however, the Company 
recorded a provision for credit losses only when the required 
allowance exceeded any remaining credit discounts. 

The evaluation of the appropriate allowance for credit losses 

for purchased impaired loans in the various loan segments 
through December 31, 2019, considered the expected cash 
flows to be collected from the borrower. These loans were initially 
recorded at fair value and, therefore, no allowance for credit 
losses was recorded at the purchase date. 

Subsequent to the purchase date, the expected cash flows of 

purchased loans were subject to evaluation. Decreases in 
expected cash flows were recognized by recording an allowance 

47 

for credit losses. If the expected cash flows on the purchased 
loans increased such that a previously recorded impairment 
allowance could have been reversed, the Company recorded a 
reduction in the allowance. Increases in expected cash flows of 
purchased loans, when there are no reversals of previous 
impairment allowances, were recognized over the remaining life of 
the loans. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements, for more information. 

The Company’s methodology for determining the appropriate 

allowance for credit losses for both loan segments also 
considered the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used. 
As a result, in addition to the amounts determined under the 
methodologies described above, management also considered 
the potential impact of other qualitative factors which include, but 
are not limited to, the following: economic factors; geographic 
and other concentration risks; delinquency and nonaccrual 
trends; current business conditions; changes in lending policy, 
underwriting standards and other relevant business practices; 
results of internal review; and the regulatory environment. The 
consideration of these items resulted in adjustments to allowance 
amounts included in the Company’s allowance for credit losses 
for both loan segments. Table 19 shows the amount of the 
allowance for credit losses by loan class and underlying portfolio 
category. 

Although the Company determined the amount of each 
element of the allowance separately and considers this process 
to be an important credit management tool, the entire allowance 
for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. The actual 
amount of losses can vary significantly from the estimated 
amounts. 

Residual Value Risk Management The Company manages its 
risk to changes in the residual value of leased vehicles, office and 
business equipment, and other assets through disciplined 
residual valuation setting at the inception of a lease, diversification 
of its leased assets, regular residual asset valuation reviews and 
monitoring of residual value gains or losses upon the disposition 
of assets. Lease originations are subject to the same well-defined 
underwriting standards referred to in the “Credit Risk 
Management” section, which includes an evaluation of the 
residual value risk. Retail lease residual value risk is mitigated 
further by effective end-of-term marketing of off-lease vehicles. 
Included in the retail leasing portfolio was approximately 
$6.6 billion of retail leasing residuals at December 31, 2019 and 
2018. The Company monitors concentrations of leases by 
manufacturer and vehicle type. As of December 31, 2019, vehicle 
lease residuals related to sport utility vehicles were 48.8 percent 
of the portfolio, while truck and crossover utility vehicle classes 
represented approximately 25.3 percent and 15.1 percent of the 
portfolio, respectively. At year-end 2019, the individual vehicle 
model with the largest residual value outstanding represented 
12.2 percent of the aggregate residual value of all vehicles in the 
portfolio. At December 31, 2019, the weighted-average 
origination term of the portfolio was 41 months, compared with 
40 months at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, the 

commercial leasing portfolio had $481 million of residuals, 
compared with $495 million at December 31, 2018. At year-end 
2019, lease residuals related to business and office equipment 
represented 33.9 percent of the total residual portfolio, while 
trucks and other transportation equipment represented 
31.2 percent. 

Operational Risk Management Operational risk is the risk of 
loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or 
systems, people, or adverse external events, including the risk of 
loss resulting from fraud, litigation and breaches in data security. 
The Company operates in many different businesses in diverse 
markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to 
process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is 
inherent in all business activities, and the management of this risk 
is important to the achievement of the Company’s objectives. 
Business lines have direct and primary responsibility and 
accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring 
operational risks embedded in their business activities. The 
Company maintains a system of controls with the objective of 
providing proper transaction authorization and execution, proper 
system operations, proper oversight of third parties with whom it 
does business, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and 
ensuring the reliability and security of financial and other data. 

Business continuation and disaster recovery planning is also 
critical to effectively managing operational risks. Each business 
unit of the Company is required to develop, maintain and test 
these plans at least annually to ensure that recovery activities, if 
needed, can support mission critical functions, including 
technology, networks and data centers supporting customer 
applications and business operations. 

While the Company believes it has designed effective 
processes to minimize operational risks, there is no absolute 
assurance that business disruption or operational losses would 
not occur from an external event or internal control breakdown. 
On an ongoing basis, management makes process changes and 
investments to enhance its systems of internal controls and 
business continuity and disaster recovery plans. 

In the past, the Company has experienced attack attempts on 
its computer systems, including various denial-of-service attacks 
on customer-facing websites. The Company has not experienced 
any material losses relating to these attempts, as a result of its 
controls, processes and systems to protect its networks, 
computers, software and data from attack, damage or 
unauthorized access but future attacks could be more disruptive 
or damaging. Attack attempts on the Company’s computer 
systems are evolving and increasing, and the Company continues 
to develop and enhance its controls and processes to protect 
against these attempts. 

Compliance Risk Management The Company may suffer legal 
or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or damage to its 
reputation through failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, 
standards of good practice, and codes of conduct, including 
those related to compliance with Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money 
laundering requirements, sanctions compliance requirements as 

48 

administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, consumer 
protection and other requirements. The Company has controls 
and processes in place for the assessment, identification, 
monitoring, management and reporting of compliance risks and 
issues. Refer to “Supervision and Regulation” in the Company’s 
Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the 
regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and 
their subsidiaries. 

Interest Rate Risk Management In the banking industry, 
changes in interest rates are a significant risk that can impact 
earnings and the safety and soundness of an entity. The 
Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates 
through asset and liability management activities within guidelines 
established by its Asset Liability Management Committee 
(“ALCO”) and approved by the Board of Directors. The ALCO has 
the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with the 
ALCO management policies, including interest rate risk exposure. 
One way the Company measures and analyzes its interest rate 
risk is through net interest income simulation analysis. 

Simulation analysis incorporates substantially all of the 

Company’s assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet 
instruments, together with forecasted changes in the balance 
sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate 
environment. Through this simulation, management estimates the 
impact on net interest income of various interest rate changes 
that differ in the direction, amount and speed of change over 

TABLE 20  Sensitivity of Net Interest Income 

time, as well as the shape of the yield curve. This simulation 
includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to be 
affected by changes in loan and deposit growth. Assumptions are 
made to project interest rates for new loans and deposits based 
on historical analysis, management’s outlook and re-pricing 
strategies. These assumptions are reviewed and validated on a 
periodic basis with sensitivity analysis being provided for key 
variables of the simulation. The results are reviewed monthly by 
the ALCO and are used to guide asset/liability management 
strategies. 

The Company manages its interest rate risk position by 

holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its 
balance sheet, implementing certain pricing strategies for loans 
and deposits and selecting derivatives and various funding and 
investment portfolio strategies. 

Table 20 summarizes the projected impact to net interest 
income over the next 12 months of various potential interest rate 
changes. The sensitivity of the projected impact to net interest 
income over the next 12 months is dependent on balance sheet 
growth, product mix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding 
decisions. While the Company utilizes assumptions based on 
historical information and expected behaviors, actual outcomes 
could vary significantly. For example, if deposit outflows are more 
limited (stable) than the assumptions the Company used in 
preparing Table 20, the projected impact to net interest income 
would be an increase of 1.26 percent in the “Up 50 bps” and 
1.93 percent in the “Up 200 bps” scenarios.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks 
To manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate, 
prepayment, credit, price and foreign currency fluctuations (asset 
and liability management positions), the Company enters into 
derivative transactions. The Company uses derivatives for asset 
and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways: 

– To convert fixed-rate debt from fixed-rate payments to floating-

rate payments; 

– To convert the cash flows associated with floating-rate debt 

from floating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments; 

– To mitigate changes in value of the Company’s unfunded 
mortgage loan commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs; 

– To mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency 

denominated balances; and 

– To mitigate the volatility of the Company’s net investment in 
foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency 
exchange rates. 

In addition, the Company enters into interest rate and foreign 

exchange derivative contracts to support the business 
requirements of its customers (customer-related positions). The 
Company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customer-
related positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions 
with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering into other 
derivative or non-derivative financial instruments that partially or 
fully offset the exposure from these customer-related positions. 
The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either 
exchange-traded, centrally cleared through clearinghouses or 
over-the-counter. The Company does not utilize derivatives for 
speculative purposes. 

The Company does not designate all of the derivatives that it 
enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges 
because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting 
requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the 
related hedged items. In particular, the Company enters into 
interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy 
to-be-announced securities (“TBAs”), U.S. Treasury and 
Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury futures to 
mitigate fluctuations in the value of its MSRs, but does not 
designate those derivatives as accounting hedges. The estimated 
net sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the fair value of the 
MSRs and the related derivative instruments at December 31, 
2019, to an immediate 25, 50 and 100 bps downward movement 
in interest rates would be a decrease of approximately $1 million, 
$10 million and $50 million, respectively. An immediate upward 
movement in interest rates at December 31, 2019, of 25, 50 and 
100 bps would result in a decrease of approximately $2 million, 
$10 million and $65 million, in the fair value of the MSRs and 
related derivative instruments, respectively. Refer to Note 9 of the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
information regarding MSRs. 

Additionally, the Company uses forward commitments to sell 
TBAs and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans 
at specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in 

its residential mortgage loan production activities. At 
December 31, 2019, the Company had $6.9 billion of forward 
commitments to sell, hedging $4.6 billion of MLHFS and 
$3.0 billion of unfunded mortgage loan commitments. The 
forward commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan 
commitments on loans intended to be sold are considered 
derivatives under the accounting guidance related to accounting 
for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The Company 
has elected the fair value option for the MLHFS. 

Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with 
counterparties to the contracts. Credit risk associated with 
derivatives is measured by the Company based on the probability 
of counterparty default. The Company manages the credit risk of 
its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various 
counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements, and, 
where possible, by requiring collateral arrangements. The 
Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to 
interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk 
participation agreements. In addition, certain interest rate swaps, 
interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be 
centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate 
counterparty credit risk. 

For additional information on derivatives and hedging 

activities, refer to Notes 19 and 20 in the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 

LIBOR Transition In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial 
Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require 
banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate 
(“LIBOR”) after 2021. The Company holds financial instruments 
that will be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR, including 
certain loans, investment securities, derivatives, borrowings and 
other financial instruments that use LIBOR as the benchmark 
rate. The Company also provides various services to customers 
in its capacity as trustee, which involve financial instruments that 
will be similarly impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR. The 
Company anticipates these financial instruments will require 
transition to a new reference rate. This transition will occur over 
the next several years as many of these arrangements do not 
have an alternative rate referenced in their contracts or a clear 
path for the parties to agree upon an alternative reference rate. In 
order to facilitate the transition process, the Company has 
instituted a LIBOR Transition Office and commenced an 
enterprise-wide project to identify, assess and monitor risks 
associated with the expected discontinuance or unavailability of 
LIBOR, actively engage with industry working groups and 
regulators, achieve operational readiness and engage impacted 
customers. Refer to “Risk Factors” beginning on page 146, for 
further discussion on potential risks that could adversely affect 
the Company’s financial results as a result of the LIBOR 
transition. 

Market Risk Management In addition to interest rate risk, the 
Company is exposed to other forms of market risk, principally 
related to trading activities which support customers’ strategies 

50 

to manage their own foreign currency, interest rate risk and 
funding activities. For purposes of its internal capital adequacy 
assessment process, the Company considers risk arising from its 
trading activities, as well as the remeasurement volatility of foreign 
currency denominated balances included on its Consolidated 
Balance Sheet (collectively, “Covered Positions”), employing 
methodologies consistent with the requirements of regulatory 
rules for market risk. The Company’s Market Risk Committee 
(“MRC”), within the framework of the ALCO, oversees market risk 
management. The MRC monitors and reviews the Company’s 
Covered Positions and establishes policies for market risk 
management, including exposure limits for each portfolio. The 
Company uses a VaR approach to measure general market risk. 
Theoretically, VaR represents the statistical risk of loss the 
Company has to adverse market movements over a one-day time 
horizon. The Company uses the Historical Simulation method to 
calculate VaR for its Covered Positions measured at the ninety-
ninth percentile using a one-year look-back period for 
distributions derived from past market data. The market factors 
used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks 
inherent in the underlying trading portfolios, principally those that 
affect the Company’s corporate bond trading business, foreign 
currency transaction business, client derivatives business, loan 
trading business and municipal securities business, as well as 
those inherent in the Company’s foreign denominated balances 
and the derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement 
volatility. On average, the Company expects the one-day VaR to 
be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related 
to these positions. The Company monitors the accuracy of 
internal VaR models and modeling processes by back-testing 
model performance, regularly updating the historical data used by 
the VaR models and regular model validations to assess the 
accuracy of the models’ input, processing, and reporting 
components. All models are required to be independently 
reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use. If the 
Company were to experience market losses in excess of the 
estimated VaR more often than expected, the VaR models and 
associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted. 

The Company calculates Stressed VaR using the same 
underlying methodology and model as VaR, except that a 
historical continuous one-year look-back period is utilized that 
reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the 
Company’s Covered Positions. The period selected by the 
Company includes the significant market volatility of the last four 
months of 2008. 

The average, high, low and period-end one-day Stressed VaR 
amounts for the Company’s Covered Positions were as follows:

Valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign 
currency activities are based on discounted cash flow or other 
valuation techniques using market-based assumptions. These 
valuations are compared to third-party quotes or other market 
prices to determine if there are significant variances. Significant 
variances are approved by senior management in the Company’s 
corporate functions. Valuation of positions in the corporate bond 
trading, loan trading and municipal securities businesses are 
based on trader marks. These trader marks are evaluated against 
third-party prices, with significant variances approved by senior 
management in the Company’s corporate functions. 

The Company also measures the market risk of its hedging 

activities related to residential MLHFS and MSRs using the 
Historical Simulation method. The VaRs are measured at the 
ninety-ninth percentile and employ factors pertinent to the market 
risks inherent in the valuation of the assets and hedges. A 
one-year look-back period is used to obtain past market data for 
the models. 

The average, high and low VaR amounts for the residential 
MLHFS and related hedges and the MSRs and related hedges 
were as follows:

The Company did not experience any actual losses for its 
combined Covered Positions that exceeded VaR during 2019 
and 2018. The Company stress tests its market risk 
measurements to provide management with perspectives on 
market events that may not be captured by its VaR models, 
including worst case historical market movement combinations 
that have not necessarily occurred on the same date.

Liquidity Risk Management The Company’s liquidity risk 
management process is designed to identify, measure, and 
manage the Company’s funding and liquidity risk to meet its daily 
funding needs and to address expected and unexpected 

51 

changes in its funding requirements. The Company engages in 
various activities to manage its liquidity risk. These activities 
include diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and 
holding readily-marketable assets which can be used as a source 
of liquidity if needed. In addition, the Company’s profitable 
operations, sound credit quality and strong capital position have 
enabled it to develop a large and reliable base of core deposit 
funding within its market areas and in domestic and global capital 
markets. 

The Company’s Board of Directors approves the Company’s 

liquidity policy. The Risk Management Committee of the 
Company’s Board of Directors oversees the Company’s liquidity 
risk management process and approves a contingency funding 
plan. The ALCO reviews the Company’s liquidity policy and limits, 
and regularly assesses the Company’s ability to meet funding 
requirements arising from adverse company-specific or market 
events. 

The Company’s liquidity policy requires it to maintain 

diversified wholesale funding sources to avoid maturity, entity and 
market concentrations. The Company operates a Cayman 
Islands branch for issuing Eurodollar time deposits. In addition, 
the Company has relationships with dealers to issue national 
market retail and institutional savings certificates and short-term 
and medium-term notes. The Company also maintains a 
significant correspondent banking network and relationships. 
Accordingly, the Company has access to national federal funds, 
funding through repurchase agreements and sources of stable 
certificates of deposit and commercial paper. 

The Company regularly projects its funding needs under 
various stress scenarios and maintains a contingency funding 
plan consistent with the Company’s access to diversified sources 
of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level 
of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance sheet and 
off-balance sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include 
cash at the Federal Reserve Bank and certain European central 
banks, unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow from 
the FHLB and at Federal Reserve Bank’s Discount Window. 
Unencumbered liquid assets in the Company’s investment 
securities portfolio provides asset liquidity through the Company’s 
ability to sell the securities or pledge and borrow against them. At 

December 31, 2019, the fair value of unencumbered investment 
securities totaled $114.2 billion, compared with $100.2 billion at 
December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements and “Balance Sheet Analysis” 
for further information on investment securities maturities and 
trends. Asset liquidity is further enhanced by the Company’s 
practice of pledging loans to access secured borrowing facilities 
through the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank. At December 31, 
2019, the Company could have borrowed an additional 
$97.4 billion from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank based on 
collateral available for additional borrowings. 

The Company’s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable 
source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, while reducing 
the Company’s reliance on the wholesale markets. Total deposits 
were $361.9 billion at December 31, 2019, compared with 
$345.5 billion at December 31, 2018. Refer to Table 14 and 
“Balance Sheet Analysis” for further information on the 
Company’s deposits. 

Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-

term borrowings. Long-term debt was $40.2 billion at 
December 31, 2019, and is an important funding source because 
of its multi-year borrowing structure. Refer to Note 13 of the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on 
the terms and maturities of the Company’s long-term debt 
issuances and “Balance Sheet Analysis” for discussion on long­
term debt trends. Short-term borrowings were $23.7 billion at 
December 31, 2019, and supplement the Company’s other 
funding sources. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements and “Balance Sheet Analysis” for 
information on the terms and trends of the Company’s short-term 
borrowings. 

The Company’s ability to raise negotiated funding at 

competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies’ views of the 
Company’s credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings. Table 21 
details the rating agencies’ most recent assessments. 

In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, 
the Company monitors the parent company’s liquidity. The parent 
company’s routine funding requirements consist primarily of 
operating expenses, dividends paid to shareholders, debt 
service, repurchases of common stock and funds used for

acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet its 
obligations from dividends collected from its subsidiaries and the 
issuance of debt and capital securities. The Company establishes 
limits for the minimal number of months into the future where the 
parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations 
with cash and securities held that can be readily monetized. The 
Company measures and manages this limit in both normal and 
adverse conditions. The Company maintains sufficient funding to 
meet expected capital and debt service obligations for 24 months 
without the support of dividends from subsidiaries and assuming 
access to the wholesale markets is maintained. The Company 
maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its capital and debt service 
obligations for 12 months under adverse conditions without the 
support of dividends from subsidiaries or access to the wholesale 
markets. The parent company is currently well in excess of 
required liquidity minimums. 

Under United States Securities and Exchange Commission 

rules, the parent company is classified as a “well-known 
seasoned issuer,” which allows it to file a registration statement 
that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. “Well-known 
seasoned issuers” generally include those companies with 
outstanding common securities with a market value of at least 
$700 million held by non-affiliated parties or those companies 
that have issued at least $1 billion in aggregate principal amount 
of non-convertible securities, other than common equity, in the 
last three years. However, the parent company’s ability to issue 
debt and other securities under a registration statement filed with 
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission under 
these rules is limited by the debt issuance authority granted by 
the Company’s Board of Directors and/or the ALCO policy. 
At December 31, 2019, parent company long-term debt 
outstanding was $18.6 billion, compared with $16.3 billion at 

December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to 
$2.7 billion of medium-term note and $1.0 billion of subordinated 
note issuances, partially offset by $1.5 billion of medium-term 
note repayments. As of December 31, 2019, there was no parent 
company debt scheduled to mature in 2020. Future debt 
maturities may be met through medium-term note and capital 
security issuances and dividends from subsidiaries, as well as 
from parent company cash and cash equivalents. 

Dividend payments to the Company by its subsidiary bank are 
subject to regulatory review and statutory limitations and, in some 
instances, regulatory approval. In general, dividends to the parent 
company from its banking subsidiary are limited by rules which 
compare dividends to net income for regulatorily-defined periods. 
For further information, see Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 

The Company is subject to a regulatory Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (“LCR”) requirement which requires banks to maintain an 
adequate level of unencumbered high quality liquid assets to 
meet estimated liquidity needs over a 30-day stressed period. At 
December 31, 2019, the Company was compliant with this 
requirement. 

European Exposures The Company provides merchant 
processing and corporate trust services in Europe either directly 
or through banking affiliations in Europe. Revenue generated from 
sources in Europe represented approximately 2 percent of the 
Company’s total net revenue for 2019. Operating cash for these 
businesses is deposited on a short-term basis typically with 
certain European central banks. For deposits placed at other 
European banks, exposure is mitigated by the Company placing 
deposits at multiple banks and managing the amounts on deposit 
at any bank based on institution-specific deposit limits. At 
December 31, 2019, the Company had an aggregate amount on

respective taxing authority.

(e)  Primarily includes purchase obligations for goods and services covered by noncancellable contracts including cancellation fees. 

deposit with European banks of approximately $8.5 billion, 
predominately with the Central Bank of Ireland and Bank of 
England. 

In addition, the Company provides financing to domestic 
multinational corporations that generate revenue from customers 
in European countries, transacts with various European banks as 
counterparties to certain derivative-related activities, and through 
a subsidiary, manages money market funds that hold certain 
investments in European sovereign debt. Any deterioration in 
economic conditions in Europe, including the potential negative 
impact of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European 
Union (“Brexit”), is not expected to have a significant effect on the 
Company related to these activities. The Company is focused on 
providing continuity of services, with minimal disruption resulting 
from Brexit, to customers with activities in European countries. 
The Company has made certain structural changes to its legal 
entities and operations in the United Kingdom and European 
Union, where needed, and migrated certain business activities to 
the appropriate jurisdictions to continue to provide such services 
and generate revenue. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet 
arrangements include any contractual arrangements to which an 
unconsolidated entity is a party, under which the Company has 
an obligation to provide credit or liquidity enhancements or 
market risk support. Off-balance sheet arrangements also include 
any obligation related to a variable interest held in an 
unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, credit 
enhancement or market risk support. The Company has not 
utilized private label asset securitizations as a source of funding. 

Commitments to extend credit are legally binding and 

generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. 
Many of the Company’s commitments to extend credit expire 
without being drawn and, therefore, total commitment amounts 
do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements or the 
Company’s exposure to credit loss. Commitments to extend 
credit also include consumer credit lines that are cancelable upon 

notification to the consumer. Total contractual amounts of 
commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2019 were 
$324.1 billion. The Company also issues and confirms various 
types of letters of credit, including standby and commercial. Total 
contractual amounts of letters of credit at December 31, 2019 
were $10.6 billion. For more information on the Company’s 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, refer to 
Note 22 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements with 
unconsolidated entities primarily consist of private investment 
funds or partnerships that make equity investments, provide debt 
financing or support community-based investments in 
tax-advantaged projects. In addition to providing investment 
returns, these arrangements in many cases assist the Company 
in complying with requirements of the Community Reinvestment 
Act. The investments in these entities generate a return primarily 
through the realization of federal and state income tax credits and 
other tax benefits, such as tax deductions from operating losses 
of the investments, over specified time periods. The entities in 
which the Company invests are generally considered variable 
interest entities (“VIEs”). The Company’s recorded net investment 
in these entities as of December 31, 2019 was approximately 
$3.2 billion. 

The Company also has non-controlling financial investments in 
private funds and partnerships considered VIEs. The Company’s 
recorded investment in these entities was approximately 
$31 million at December 31, 2019, and the Company had 
unfunded commitments to invest an additional $24 million. For 
more information on the Company’s interests in unconsolidated 
VIEs, refer to Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 

Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by the 
Company to customers or other third parties requiring the 
Company to perform if certain conditions exist or upon the 
occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event, such as a 
scheduled payment to be made under contract. The Company’s 

54 

primary guarantees include commitments from securities lending 
activities in which indemnifications are provided to customers; 
indemnification or buy-back provisions related to sales of loans 
and tax credit investments; and merchant charge-back 
guarantees through the Company’s involvement in providing 
merchant processing services. For certain guarantees, the 
Company may have access to collateral to support the 
guarantee, or through the exercise of other recourse provisions, 
be able to offset some or all of any payments made under these 
guarantees. 

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries, along with other 

Visa U.S.A. Inc. member banks, have a contingent guarantee 
obligation to indemnify Visa Inc. for potential losses arising from 
antitrust lawsuits challenging the practices of Visa U.S.A. Inc. and 
MasterCard International. The indemnification by the Company 
and other Visa U.S.A. Inc. member banks has no maximum 
amount. Refer to Note 22 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for further details regarding guarantees, other 
commitments, and contingent liabilities, including maximum 
potential future payments and current carrying amounts. 

Capital Management The Company is committed to managing 
capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors 
and for maximum shareholder benefit. The Company continually 
assesses its business risks and capital position. The Company 
also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital 
requirements for banking organizations. To achieve its capital 
goals, the Company employs a variety of capital management 
tools, including dividends, common share repurchases, and the 
issuance of subordinated debt, non-cumulative perpetual 
preferred stock, common stock and other capital instruments. 

On September 17, 2019, the Company announced its Board 

of Directors had approved a 13.5 percent increase in the 
Company’s dividend rate per common share, from $0.37 per 
quarter to $0.42 per quarter. 

The Company repurchased approximately 81 million shares of 

its common stock in 2019, compared with approximately 
54 million shares in 2018. The average price paid for the shares 
repurchased in 2019 was $55.88 per share, compared with 
$52.57 per share in 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the 
approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased by 
the Company under the current share repurchase program 
approved by the Board of Directors was $2.4 billion. For a more 
complete analysis of activities impacting shareholders’ equity and 
capital management programs, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders’ equity was $51.9 billion at 

December 31, 2019, compared with $51.0 billion at 
December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily the result of 
corporate earnings and changes in unrealized gains and losses 
on available-for-sale investment securities included in other 
comprehensive income (loss), partially offset by common share 
repurchases and dividends. 

The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company 
follow Basel III, which includes two comprehensive methodologies 
for calculating risk-weighted assets: a general standardized 

approach and more risk-sensitive advanced approaches. Prior to 
December 31, 2019, the Company’s capital adequacy was 
evaluated against the methodology that was most restrictive. In 
November 2019, the Company’s regulators issued final rules 
which tailor regulations to reduce certain compliance requirements 
for banking organizations with less risk. These rules reduced the 
Company’s capital and liquidity requirements and no longer 
subject the Company to calculating its capital adequacy as a 
percentage of risk-weighted assets under advanced approaches 
effective December 31, 2019. Under Basel III, banking regulators 
define minimum capital requirements for banks and financial 
services holding companies. These requirements are expressed in 
the form of a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 
capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, tier 1 leverage ratio and 
a tier 1 total leverage exposure, or supplementary leverage, ratio. 
The Company’s minimum required level for these ratios at 
December 31, 2019, which include a capital conservation buffer 
of 2.5 percent for the common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital 
and total capital ratios, was 7.0 percent, 8.5 percent, 
10.5 percent, 4.0 percent, and 3.0 percent, respectively. The 
Company targets its regulatory capital levels, at both the bank and 
bank holding company level, to exceed the “well-capitalized” 
threshold for these ratios under the FDIC Improvement Act 
prompt corrective action provisions that are applicable to all 
banks. At December 31, 2019, the Company’s minimum “well­
capitalized” threshold for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, 
tier 1 capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, tier 1 leverage 
ratio, and tier 1 total leverage exposure ratio was 6.5 percent, 
8.0 percent, 10.0 percent, 5.0 percent, and 3.0 percent, 
respectively. The most recent notification from the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency categorized the Company’s bank 
subsidiary as “well-capitalized”. There are no conditions or events 
since that notification that management believes have changed 
the risk-based category of its covered subsidiary bank. 

In addition, as a result of the November 2019 rule changes, 
the Company received approval from the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System in late 2019 to increase the 
authorization amount of its common stock repurchase program 
effective through June 30, 2020, which enabled it to reduce its 
common equity tier 1 capital ratio from 9.6 percent at 
September 30, 2019 to 9.1 percent at December 31, 2019. 
As an approved mortgage seller and servicer, U.S. Bank 
National Association, through its mortgage banking division, is 
required to maintain various levels of shareholder’s equity, as 
specified by various agencies, including the United States 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, Government 
National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association. At 
December 31, 2019, U.S. Bank National Association met these 
requirements. 

Table 23 provides a summary of statutory regulatory capital 
ratios in effect for the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018. 
All regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory “well-capitalized” 
requirements.

The Company believes certain other capital ratios are useful in 

evaluating its capital adequacy. The Company’s tangible 
common equity, as a percent of tangible assets and as a percent 
of risk-weighted assets calculated under the standardized 
approach, was 7.5 percent and 9.3 percent, respectively, at 
December 31, 2019, compared with 7.8 percent and 
9.4 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Refer to 
“Non-GAAP Financial Measures” beginning on page 62 for further 
information on these other capital ratios. 

Fourth Quarter Summary 
The Company reported net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp 
of $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019, or $0.90 per diluted 
common share, compared with $1.9 billion, or $1.10 per diluted 
common share, for the fourth quarter of 2018. Return on average 
assets and return on average common equity were 1.21 percent 
and 11.8 percent, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2019, 
compared with 1.59 percent and 15.8 percent, respectively, for 
the fourth quarter of 2018. The results for the fourth quarter of 
2019 included the impact of the severance and asset impairment 
restructuring charges, and the increased derivative liability related 
to Visa shares previously sold by the Company. Combined, these 
items decreased fourth quarter 2019 diluted earnings per 
common share by $0.18. 

Total net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019, was 

$162 million (2.8 percent) lower than the fourth quarter of 2018, 
reflecting a 2.9 percent decrease in net interest income 
(3.0 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis) and a 2.5 percent 
decrease in noninterest income. The decrease in net interest 
income from the fourth quarter of 2018 was mainly a result of the 

impact of the yield curve and changes in deposit and funding mix, 
partially offset by higher yields on the reinvestment of securities in 
addition to loan growth. The noninterest income decrease was 
driven by lower other noninterest income and deposit service 
charges, partially offset by growth in payment services revenue, 
trust and investment management fees and mortgage banking 
revenue. 

Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 

$121 million (3.7 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2018, 
primarily due to increases in personnel expense driven by 
stronger fee revenue production in mortgage activities, 
technology and communications expense in support of business 
growth, net occupancy and equipment expense due to capital 
expenditures in support of business growth, and other 
noninterest expense. 

Fourth quarter 2019 net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, was $3.2 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in 
the fourth quarter of 2018. The $100 million (3.0 percent) 
decrease was principally driven by the impact of lower interest 
rates and a flatter yield curve in addition to changes in deposit 
and funding mix, partially offset by higher yields on reinvestment 
of securities and loan growth. Average earning assets were 
$19.3 billion (4.6 percent) higher in the fourth quarter of 2019, 
compared with the fourth quarter of 2018, reflecting increases of 
$11.2 billion (3.9 percent) in average loans and $7.5 billion 
(6.6 percent) in average investment securities. The net interest 
margin, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in the fourth quarter of 
2019 was 2.92 percent, compared with 3.15 percent in the fourth 
quarter of 2018. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily 
due to the impact of declining interest rates on the yield curve in 
addition to changes in deposit and funding mix.

Noninterest income in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 

$2.4 billion, representing a decrease of $62 million (2.5 percent) 
from the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease reflected lower 
other noninterest income and deposit service charges, partially 
offset by growth in payment services revenue, trust and 
investment management fees and mortgage banking revenue. 
Other noninterest income decreased $172 million (55.5 percent) 
in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with the same period of 
the prior year, reflecting the net impact in the fourth quarter of 
2019 of the $140 million charge for the increased derivative 
liability related to Visa shares previously sold by the Company, 
partially offset by a gain on the sale of a loan portfolio, and the net 
impact in the fourth quarter of 2018 of the $340 million gain 
recorded from the sale of the Company’s ATM servicing 
business, partially offset by $264 million of asset impairment 
charges related to the sale of a majority of the Company’s 
covered loans and certain other assets. Deposit service charges 
decreased $22 million (8.7 percent) primarily due to the sale of 
the Company’s ATM servicing business in the fourth quarter of 
2018. The increase in payment services revenue reflected 
higher merchant processing services revenue of $20 million 
(5.1 percent), driven by higher sales volumes and merchant fees, 

partially offset by slightly lower credit and debit card revenue of 
$4 million (1.0 percent) and corporate payment products revenue 
of $5 million (3.1 percent). The decline in corporate payment 
products revenue was driven by lower commercial business sales 
volumes. Trust and investment management fees increased 
$29 million (7.1 percent) due to business growth and favorable 
market conditions, while mortgage banking revenue increased 
$73 million (42.7 percent) due to higher mortgage production and 
gain on sale margins. 

Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 
$3.4 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in the same period of 
2018, representing an increase of $121 million (3.7 percent). The 
increase was primarily due to higher personnel expense, 
technology and communications expense, net occupancy and 
equipment expense, and other noninterest expense. 
Compensation expense in the fourth quarter of 2019 increased 
$29 million (1.8 percent) over the same period of the prior year, 
driven by the impact of hiring to support business growth, merit 
increases and higher variable compensation related to business 
production within mortgage banking, while employee benefits 
expense increased $7 million (2.3 percent) primarily due to higher 
medical costs. Technology and communications expense 

57 

increased $37 million (14.6 percent) and net occupancy and 
equipment expense increased $20 million (7.5 percent), primarily 
to support business growth. Other noninterest expense increased 
$26 million (5.0 percent) primarily due to the net impacts of 
severance charges and other accruals of $200 million in the 
fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by severance charges and 
accruals for legal matters of $174 million in the fourth quarter of 
2018. 

The provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2019 
was $395 million, an increase of $27 million (7.3 percent) from the 
same period of 2018. The provision for credit losses was 
$10 million higher than net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 
2019 and $15 million higher than net charge-offs in the fourth 
quarter of 2018. The increase in the allowance for credit losses 
during the fourth quarter of 2019 reflected loan portfolio growth. 
Net charge-offs were $385 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, 
compared with $353 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The net 
charge-off ratio was 0.52 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, 
compared with 0.49 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018. 

The provision for income taxes was $354 million (an effective 

rate of 19.2 percent) for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared 
with $291 million (an effective rate of 13.5 percent) for the same 
period of 2018. The fourth quarter of 2018 provision for income 
taxes reflected the favorable impact of deferred tax assets and 
liabilities adjustments related to tax reform legislation enacted in 
late 2017. 

Line of Business Financial Review 
The Company’s major lines of business are Corporate and 
Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Wealth 
Management and Investment Services, Payment Services, and 
Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are 
components of the Company about which financial information is 
prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding 
how to allocate resources and assess performance. 

Basis for Financial Presentation Business line results are 
derived from the Company’s business unit profitability reporting 
systems by specifically attributing managed balance sheet assets, 
deposits and other liabilities and their related income or expense. 
Refer to Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for further information on the business lines’ basis for 
financial presentation. 

Designations, assignments and allocations change from time 

to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of 
evaluating performance or product lines change or business 
segments are realigned to better respond to the Company’s 
diverse customer base. During 2019, certain organization and 
methodology changes were made and, accordingly, 2018 results 
were restated and presented on a comparable basis. 

Corporate and Commercial Banking Corporate and 
Commercial Banking offers lending, equipment finance and small-
ticket leasing, depository services, treasury management, capital 
markets services, international trade services and other financial 
services to middle market, large corporate, commercial real 

estate, financial institution, non-profit and public sector clients. 
Corporate and Commercial Banking contributed $1.5 billion of 
the Company’s net income in 2019, or a decrease of $52 million 
(3.3 percent), compared with 2018. 

Net revenue decreased $41 million (1.1 percent) in 2019, 

compared with 2018. Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, decreased $65 million (2.2 percent) in 2019, 
compared with 2018, primarily due to lower noninterest-bearing 
deposit balances from 2018 and lower rates on loans, reflecting a 
competitive marketplace, partially offset by the impact of higher 
rates on the margin benefit from deposits and loan and interest-
bearing deposit growth. Noninterest-bearing deposits are 
declining as customers deploy balances to support business 
growth. Noninterest income increased $24 million (2.8 percent) in 
2019, compared with 2018, primarily due to higher trading 
revenue and corporate bond underwriting fees, partially offset by 
lower loan syndications revenue. 

Noninterest expense increased $16 million (1.0 percent) in 
2019, compared with 2018, reflecting higher net shared services 
expense driven by technology development and investment in 
infrastructure, higher salary expense driven by merit increases, 
and increases in production incentives associated with higher 
capital markets revenue. These increases were partially offset by 
lower FDIC assessment costs. The provision for credit losses 
increased $13 million (20.0 percent) in 2019, compared with 
2018, due to higher net charge-offs, partially offset by a favorable 
change in the reserve allocation. 

Consumer and Business Banking Consumer and Business 
Banking delivers products and services through banking offices, 
telephone servicing and sales, on-line services, direct mail, ATM 
processing and mobile devices. It encompasses community 
banking, metropolitan banking and indirect lending, as well as 
mortgage banking. Consumer and Business Banking contributed 
$2.3 billion of the Company’s net income in 2019, or an increase 
of $38 million (1.7 percent), compared with 2018. 

Net revenue increased $176 million (2.1 percent) in 2019, 

compared with 2018. Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, increased $105 million (1.7 percent) in 2019, 
compared with 2018, primarily due to the impact of higher rates 
on the margin benefit from deposits, as well as growth in both 
interest-bearing deposit balances and loan balances, partially 
offset by lower rates on loans. Noninterest income increased 
$71 million (3.1 percent) in 2019, compared with 2018, primarily 
due to higher mortgage banking revenue driven by higher 
mortgage production and gain on sale margins, partially offset by 
changes in MSRs valuations, net of hedging activities, as well as 
higher transition services agreement revenue associated with the 
sale of the Company’s ATM third-party servicing business during 
2018, partially offset by reductions in ATM processing services 
revenue due to the sale. 

Noninterest expense increased $46 million (0.9 percent) in 
2019, compared with 2018, primarily due to higher net shared 
services expense and higher production incentives, partially offset 
by lower FDIC assessment costs and lower mortgage banking 
costs. The increase in net shared services expense reflected the 

58 

impact of technology development and investment in 
infrastructure supporting business growth, as well as higher costs 
to manage the business, while production incentives were higher 
in support of business growth. The provision for credit losses 
increased $78 million (33.6 percent) in 2019, compared with 
2018, reflecting an unfavorable change in the reserve allocation 
as well as higher net charge-offs. 

Wealth Management and Investment Services Wealth 
Management and Investment Services provides private banking, 
financial advisory services, investment management, retail 
brokerage services, insurance, trust, custody and fund servicing 
through four businesses: Wealth Management, Global Corporate 
Trust & Custody, U.S. Bancorp Asset Management and 
Fund Services. Wealth Management and Investment Services 
contributed $895 million of the Company’s net income in 2019, 
or an increase of $81 million (10.0 percent), compared with 2018. 

Net revenue increased $77 million (2.7 percent) in 2019, 

compared with 2018. Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, increased $26 million (2.3 percent) in 2019, 
compared with 2018, primarily due to the impact of higher 
deposit balances and the impact of higher rates on the margin 
benefit from deposits. Noninterest income increased $51 million 
(2.9 percent) in 2019, compared with 2018, principally due to 
favorable market conditions and business growth. 

Noninterest expense decreased $29 million (1.6 percent) in 
2019, compared with 2018, reflecting lower costs related to FDIC 
assessment and litigation settlements. These decreases were 
partially offset by higher compensation expense, reflecting the 

impact of merit increases, increased staffing, and higher medical 
costs, as well as increased net shared service expense due to 
technology development. 

Payment Services Payment Services includes consumer and 
business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate, 
government and purchasing card services, consumer lines of 
credit and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed 
$1.5 billion of the Company’s net income in 2019, or an increase 
of $25 million (1.7 percent), compared with 2018. 

Net revenue increased $158 million (2.6 percent) in 2019, 

compared with 2018. Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, increased $50 million (2.0 percent) in 2019, 
compared with 2018, primarily due to growth in average loans as 
well as loan fees, partially offset by compression on loan rates. 
Noninterest income increased $108 million (3.0 percent) in 2019, 
compared with 2018, primarily due to higher merchant 
processing services revenue, corporate payment products 
revenue and credit and debit card revenue, all driven by higher 
sales volumes. 

Noninterest expense increased $98 million (3.3 percent) in 
2019, compared with 2018, principally due to higher net shared 
services expense to support business growth, technology 
development and investment in infrastructure, in addition to 
increases in personnel expense in support of business 
development and merit increases. The provision for credit losses 
increased $27 million (2.5 percent) in 2019, compared with 2018, 
reflecting higher net charge-offs, partially offset by a favorable 
change in the reserve allocation.

Treasury and Corporate Support Treasury and Corporate 
Support includes the Company’s investment portfolios, funding, 
capital management, interest rate risk management, income 
taxes not allocated to the business lines, including most 
investments in tax-advantaged projects, and the residual 
aggregate of those expenses associated with corporate activities 
that are managed on a consolidated basis. Treasury and 
Corporate Support recorded net income of $693 million in 2019, 
compared with $967 million in 2018. 

Net revenue decreased $21 million (1.4 percent) in 2019, 

compared with 2018. Net interest income, on a taxable-
equivalent basis, increased $4 million (1.1 percent) in 2019, 
compared with 2018, primarily due to growth in the investment 
portfolio, partially offset by changes in funding mix. Noninterest 
income decreased $25 million (2.3 percent) in 2019, compared 
with 2018, primarily due to a 2019 charge for an increased 
derivative liability related to Visa shares previously sold by the 
Company, and the 2018 net impact of the gain recorded from the 
sale of the ATM third-party servicing business and certain asset 
impairment charges. These decreases were partially offset by a 
2019 gain on the sale of a loan portfolio and higher income from 
equity investments and gains on the sale of securities. 

Noninterest expense increased $190 million (22.5 percent) in 

2019, compared with 2018, principally due to higher 
compensation expense, reflecting the impact of increased staffing 
and merit increases, and higher implementation costs of capital 
investments to support business growth. Noninterest expense 
further increased due to the net impact of severance charges and 
asset impairment accruals recorded in 2019, and severance 
charges and legal matter accruals recorded in 2018. These 
increases were partially offset by lower net shared services 
expense and lower costs related to tax-advantaged projects. The 
provision for credit losses was $8 million higher in 2019, 
compared with 2018, due to an unfavorable change in the 
reserve allocation and higher net charge-offs. 

Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a 
managerial tax rate of 25.0 percent with the residual tax expense 
or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included 
in Treasury and Corporate Support. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the 
Company considers various other measures when evaluating 
capital utilization and adequacy, including: 

– Tangible common equity to tangible assets, and 
– Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets. 

These capital measures are viewed by management as useful 
additional methods of evaluating the Company’s utilization of its 
capital held and the level of capital available to withstand 
unexpected negative market or economic conditions. 
Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors, 
analysts and banking regulators to assess the Company’s capital 
position relative to other financial services companies. These 
capital measures are not defined in generally accepted 
accounting principles (“GAAP”), or are not defined in banking 
regulations. As a result, these capital measures disclosed by the 
Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. 
Management believes this information helps investors assess 
trends in the Company’s capital adequacy. 

The Company also discloses net interest income and related 
ratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also 
be considered non-GAAP financial measures. The Company 
believes this presentation to be the preferred industry 
measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant 
comparison of net interest income arising from taxable and 
tax-exempt sources. In addition, certain performance measures, 
including the efficiency ratio and net interest margin utilize net 
interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis. 

There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to 

investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to 
consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial 
information contained in this report in their entirety, and not to rely 
on any single financial measure.

Accounting Changes 
Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
discusses accounting standards recently issued but not yet 
required to be adopted and the expected impact of these 
changes in accounting standards. To the extent the adoption of 
new accounting standards materially affects the Company’s 
financial condition or results of operations, the impacts are 
discussed in the applicable section(s) of the Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis and the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
The accounting and reporting policies of the Company comply 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP 
requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The 
Company’s financial position and results of operations can be 
affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral 
to understanding the Company’s financial statements. Critical 
accounting policies are those policies management believes are 
the most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial 
condition and results, and require management to make 
estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most 
accounting policies are not considered by management to be 
critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in 
determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of 
financial statements. These factors include, among other things, 
whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements, 
the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the 
estimates with other information (including third-party sources or 
available prices), sensitivity of the estimates to changes in 
economic conditions and whether alternative accounting 
methods may be utilized under GAAP. Management has 
discussed the development and the selection of critical 
accounting policies with the Company’s Audit Committee. 

Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of the 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Those policies 
considered to be critical accounting policies are described below. 

Allowance for Credit Losses Management’s evaluation of the 
appropriate allowance for credit losses is often the most critical of 
all the accounting estimates for a banking institution. It is an 
inherently subjective process impacted by many factors as 
discussed throughout the Management’s Discussion and 
Analysis section of the Annual Report. Through December 31, 
2019, the allowance for credit losses was established to provide 
for probable and estimable losses incurred in the Company’s 
credit portfolio. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted 
new accounting guidance which changes previous impairment 
recognition to a model that is based on expected losses rather 
than incurred losses. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion on the 

effect of the adoption of this guidance on the Company’s financial 
statements. 

The methods utilized to estimate the allowance for credit 

losses, key assumptions and quantitative and qualitative 
information considered by management in determining the 
appropriate allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2019 are 
discussed in the “Credit Risk Management” section. Although 
methodologies utilized to determine each element of the 
allowance reflect management’s assessment of credit risk as 
identified through assessments completed of individual credits 
and of homogenous pools affected by material credit events, 
degrees of imprecision exist in these measurement tools due in 
part to subjective judgments involved and an inherent lag in the 
data available to quantify current conditions and events that affect 
credit loss reserve estimates. As discussed in the “Analysis and 
Determination of Allowance for Credit Losses” section, 
management considered the effect of changes in economic 
conditions, risk management practices, and other factors that 
contributed to imprecision of loss estimates in determining the 
allowance for credit losses. If not considered, incurred losses in 
the credit portfolio related to imprecision and other subjective 
factors could have a dramatic adverse impact on the liquidity and 
financial viability of a banking institution. 

Given the many subjective factors affecting the credit portfolio, 

changes in the allowance for credit losses may not directly 
coincide with changes in the risk ratings of the credit portfolio 
reflected in the risk rating process. This is in part due to the 
timing of the risk rating process in relation to changes in the 
business cycle, the exposure and mix of loans within risk rating 
categories, levels of nonperforming loans and the timing of 
charge-offs and recoveries. The allowance for credit losses on 
commercial lending segment loans measures the incurred loss 
content on the remaining portfolio exposure, while nonperforming 
loans and net charge-offs are measures of specific impairment 
events that have already been confirmed. Therefore, the degree 
of change in the commercial lending allowance may differ from 
the level of changes in nonperforming loans and net charge-offs. 
Management maintains an appropriate allowance for credit losses 
by updating aggregate allowance rates to reflect changes in 
economic uncertainty or business cycle conditions. 

Some factors considered in determining the appropriate 
allowance for credit losses are quantifiable while other factors 
require qualitative judgment. Management conducts an analysis 
with respect to the accuracy of risk ratings and the volatility of 
inherent losses, and utilizes this analysis along with qualitative 
factors that can affect the precision of credit loss estimates, 
including economic conditions, such as changes in 
unemployment or bankruptcy rates, and concentration risks, 
such as risks associated with specific industries, collateral 
valuations, and loans to highly leveraged enterprises, in 
determining the overall level of the allowance for credit losses. 
The Company’s determination of the allowance for commercial 
lending segment loans is sensitive to the assigned credit risk 
ratings and inherent loss rates at December 31, 2019. If 
10 percent of period ending loan balances (including unfunded 

64 

commitments) within each risk category of this segment of the 
loan portfolio experienced downgrades of two risk categories, the 
allowance for credit losses would have increased by 
approximately $223 million at December 31, 2019. The Company 
believes the allowance for credit losses appropriately considers 
the imprecision in estimating credit losses based on credit risk 
ratings and inherent loss rates but actual losses may differ from 
those estimates. If inherent loss or estimated loss rates for 
commercial lending segment loans increased by 10 percent, the 
allowance for credit losses would have increased by 
approximately $177 million at December 31, 2019. The 
Company’s determination of the allowance for consumer lending 
segment loans is sensitive to changes in estimated loss rates and 
estimated impairments on restructured loans. In the event that 
estimated losses for this segment of the loan portfolio increased 
by 10 percent, the allowance for credit losses would have 
increased by approximately $174 million at December 31, 2019. 
Because several quantitative and qualitative factors are 
considered in determining the allowance for credit losses, these 
sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and 
extent of future changes in the allowance for credit losses. They 
are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse 
changes in risk rating and inherent losses and do not imply any 
expectation of future deterioration in the risk rating or loss rates. 
Given current processes employed by the Company, 
management believes the risk ratings and inherent loss rates 
currently assigned are appropriate. It is possible that others, given 
the same information, may at any point in time reach different 
reasonable conclusions that could be significant to the 
Company’s financial statements. Refer to the “Analysis and 
Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses” section for 
further information. 

Fair Value Estimates A portion of the Company’s assets and 
liabilities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, with changes in fair value recorded either through earnings 
or other comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with 
applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States. These include all of the Company’s available-for-sale 
investment securities, derivatives and other trading instruments, 
MSRs and MLHFS. The estimation of fair value also affects other 
loans held for sale, which are recorded at the lower-of-cost-or-fair 
value. The determination of fair value is important for certain other 
assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair 
value estimates, including goodwill and other intangible assets, 
impaired loans, OREO and other repossessed assets. 

Fair value is generally defined as the exit price at which an 
asset or liability could be exchanged in a current transaction 
between willing, unrelated parties, other than in a forced or 
liquidation sale. Fair value is based on quoted market prices in an 
active market, or if market prices are not available, is estimated 
using models employing techniques such as matrix pricing or 
discounting expected cash flows. The significant assumptions 
used in the models, which include assumptions for interest rates, 
discount rates, prepayments and credit losses, are independently 

verified against observable market data where possible. Where 
observable market data is not available, the estimate of fair value 
becomes more subjective and involves a high degree of 
judgment. In this circumstance, fair value is estimated based on 
management’s judgment regarding the value that market 
participants would assign to the asset or liability. This valuation 
process takes into consideration factors such as market illiquidity. 
Imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount 
recorded on the balance sheet for a particular asset or liability 
with related impacts to earnings or other comprehensive income 
(loss). 

When available, trading and available-for-sale securities are 

valued based on quoted market prices. However, certain 
securities are traded less actively and, therefore, quoted market 
prices may not be available. The determination of fair value may 
require benchmarking to similar instruments or performing a 
discounted cash flow analysis using estimates of future cash 
flows and prepayment, interest and default rates. For more 
information on investment securities, refer to Note 4 of the Notes 
to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

As few derivative contracts are listed on an exchange, the 
majority of the Company’s derivative positions are valued using 
valuation techniques that use readily observable market inputs. 
Certain derivatives, however, must be valued using techniques 
that include unobservable inputs. For these instruments, the 
significant assumptions must be estimated and, therefore, are 
subject to judgment. Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements provides a summary of the Company’s 
derivative positions. 

Refer to Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 

Statements for additional information regarding estimations of fair 
value. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are capitalized as separate 
assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained, or may be 
purchased from others. The Company records MSRs at fair 
value. Because MSRs do not trade in an active market with 
readily observable prices, the Company determines the fair value 
by estimating the present value of the asset’s future cash flows 
utilizing market-based prepayment rates, option adjusted spread, 
and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade 
information, industry surveys and independent third-party 
valuations. Changes in the fair value of MSRs are recorded in 
earnings during the period in which they occur. Risks inherent in 
the valuation of MSRs include higher than expected prepayment 
rates and/or delayed receipt of cash flows. The Company utilizes 
derivatives, including interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward 
commitments to buy TBAs, U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures 
and options on U.S. Treasury futures, to mitigate the valuation 
risk. Refer to Notes 9 and 21 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements for additional information on the 
assumptions used in determining the fair value of MSRs and an 
analysis of the sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the fair 
value of the MSRs portfolio and the related derivative instruments 
used to mitigate the valuation risk.

Income Taxes The Company estimates income tax expense 
based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax 
jurisdictions in which it operates, including federal, state and local 
domestic jurisdictions, and an insignificant amount to foreign 
jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense is reported in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income. Accrued taxes are reported 
in other assets or other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be 
received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to 
future periods. Deferred taxes arise from differences between 
assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes 
versus income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are 
recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is 
determined to be more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions 
that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are 
measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An 
uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of 
benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
upon settlement. In estimating accrued taxes, the Company 
assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax 
treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance 
in the context of the tax position. Because of the complexity of 
tax laws and regulations, interpretation can be difficult and 
subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances. 
It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any 
point in time reach different reasonable conclusions regarding the 
estimated amounts of accrued taxes. 

Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically 
due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status 
of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, 

and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that 
impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These 
changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be 
significant to the operating results of the Company. Refer to 
Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for 
additional information regarding income taxes. 

Controls and Procedures 
Under the supervision and with the participation of the 
Company’s management, including its principal executive officer 
and principal financial officer, the Company has evaluated the 
effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure 
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
“Exchange Act”)). Based upon this evaluation, the principal 
executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded 
that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the 
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there was 
no change made in the Company’s internal control over financial 
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the 
Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely 
to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial 
reporting. 

The annual report of the Company’s management on internal 
control over financial reporting is provided on page 67. The audit 
report of Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent 
accountants, regarding the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting is provided on page 70.
