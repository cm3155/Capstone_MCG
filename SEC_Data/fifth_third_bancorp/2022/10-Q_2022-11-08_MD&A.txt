 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 2) 

The following is Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of certain significant factors that have affected Fifth Third Bancorp&#8217;s (the &#8220;Bancorp&#8221; or &#8220;Fifth Third&#8221;) financial condition and results of operations during the periods included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which are a part of this filing. Reference to the Bancorp incorporates the parent holding company and all consolidated subsidiaries. The Bancorp&#8217;s banking subsidiary is referred to as the Bank. 

OVERVIEW 

Fifth Third Bancorp is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. At September 30, 2022, the Bancorp had $205 billion in assets and operated 1,080 full-service banking centers and 2,146 Fifth Third branded ATMs in eleven states throughout the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the U.S. The Bancorp reports on three business segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Small Business Banking and Wealth and Asset Management. 

This overview of MD&#38;A highlights selected information in the financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document as well as the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorp&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, refer to the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool for the reader of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD&#38;A, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Net interest income, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD&#38;A on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. The FTE basis for presenting net interest income is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&#38;A. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 69% and 31% of total revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 67% and 33% of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers domiciled in the U.S. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A, risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the Bancorp. 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio, as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral. 

Noninterest income is derived from service charges on deposits, wealth and asset management revenue, commercial banking revenue, card and processing revenue, leasing business revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, other noninterest income and net securities gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes compensation and benefits, technology and communications, net occupancy expense, equipment expense, leasing business expense, marketing expense, card and processing expense and other noninterest expense. 

COVID-19 Global Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic created significant economic uncertainty and financial disruptions during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Government and public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic caused reductions and instability in economic activity and volatility in the financial markets. This market volatility has persisted as the impacts of the pandemic have continued to evolve. Furthermore, resurgence risk remains as new strains of the virus become prevalent which may cause additional economic disruption. The Bancorp continues to closely monitor the pandemic and its effect on customers, employees, communities and markets. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, low interest rates, reduced economic activity and market volatility had the most immediate negative impacts on the Bancorp&#8217;s performance. The Bancorp is unable to estimate the extent of the impact that these factors have had on its operating results since the pandemic began and these factors may adversely impact its future operating results. 

Current Economic Conditions 

Robust demand, labor shortages and supply chain constraints have led to persistent inflationary pressures throughout the economy. In response to these inflationary pressures, the FRB has raised benchmark interest rates in recent months and may continue to raise interest rates in response to economic conditions, particularly a continued high rate of inflation. Amidst these uncertainties, some financial markets have continued to experience volatility. 

Changes in interest rates can affect numerous aspects of the Bancorp&#8217;s business and may impact the Bancorp&#8217;s future performance. If financial markets remain volatile, this may impact the future performance of various segments of the Bancorp&#8217;s business, including the value of the Bancorp&#8217;s investment securities portfolio. The Bancorp continues to closely monitor the pace of inflation and the impacts of inflation on the larger market, including labor and supply chain impacts. 

For further discussion on current economic conditions, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A. Additionally, refer to the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for additional information about the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management activities. 

In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law to address inflation, healthcare costs, climate change and renewal energy incentives, among other things. This law includes provisions for the creation of a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax rate that is effective for tax years beginning January 1, 2023, for corporations with an average annual adjusted financial statement income in excess of $1 billion. 

Senior Notes Offering 

On July 28, 2022, the Bancorp issued and sold $1 billion of fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes which will mature on July 28, 2030. The senior notes bear interest at a rate of 4.772% per annum to, but excluding, July 28, 2029. From, and including, July 28, 2029 until, but excluding, July 28, 2030, the senior notes will have an interest rate of compounded SOFR plus 2.127%. The Bancorp entered into interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to convert the fixed-rate period of the notes to a floating rate of compounded SOFR plus 2.132%. The senior notes are redeemable in whole at par plus accrued and unpaid interest one year prior to their maturity date, or may be wholly or partially redeemed 60 days prior to maturity. For further information on a subsequent event related to long-term debt, refer to Note 24. 

Business Combination 

During the second quarter of 2022, the Bancorp completed the acquisition of a national point-of-sale consumer lender specializing in home improvement and solar energy installation loans originated through a network of contractors and installers. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting which generally requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their estimated fair values at acquisition date. These fair value estimates are considered preliminary as of September 30, 2022 and are subject to change for up to one year after the acquisition date as additional information becomes available. For more information on the acquisition, refer to Notes 10 and 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

LIBOR Transition 

In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the &#8220;FCA&#8221;), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. Since then, central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for LIBOR. 

On March 5, 2021, the FCA and ICE Benchmark Administration, Limited announced that the publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR maturities and non-USD LIBOR maturities would cease immediately after December 31, 2021, with the remaining USD LIBOR maturities ceasing immediately after June 30, 2023. In the United States, the Alternative Rates Reference Committee (the &#8220;ARRC&#8221;), a group of market participants convened in 2014 to help ensure a successful transition away from USD LIBOR, identified SOFR as its preferred alternative rate. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. The composition and characteristics of SOFR are not the same as those of LIBOR, and SOFR is fundamentally different from LIBOR for two key reasons: (1) SOFR is a secured rate, while LIBOR is an unsecured rate, and (2) SOFR is an overnight rate, while LIBOR is a forward-looking rate that represents interbank funding over different maturities. As a result, there can be no assurance that SOFR, however calculated, will perform the same way as LIBOR would have at any time, including, as a result of changes in interest and yield rates in the market, market volatility, or global or regional economic, financial, political, regulatory, judicial or other events. 

On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the &#8220;LIBOR Act&#8221;) into law. The LIBOR Act offers a federal solution for transitioning legacy instruments that lack sufficient provisions addressing LIBOR&#8217;s cessation by outlining a uniform 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

process to govern the transition from LIBOR to a replacement rate. The LIBOR Act also establishes a safe harbor for lenders, shielding lenders from litigation as a result of their choice of a replacement rate (such as SOFR) per Federal Reserve Board recommendations. On July 28, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register that detailed a proposed regulation carrying out the terms of the LIBOR Act. As of September 30, 2022, the comment period had closed for this proposed regulation but it had not yet been finalized. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s LIBOR transition plan is organized around key work streams, including continued engagement with central banks and industry working groups and regulators, active client engagement, comprehensive review of legacy documentation, internal operational and technological readiness, and risk management, among other things, to facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates. 

Although the full impact of LIBOR reforms and actions remains unclear, the Bancorp has discontinued entering into new LIBOR-based contracts in accordance with regulatory guidance, except for permissible limited use, such as part of hedging and risk management programs. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Bancorp expanded its offering of alternative reference rate products, including SOFR. In addition, the Bancorp is continuing its transition of existing LIBOR-based exposures to an appropriate alternative reference rate on or before June 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2022, the Bancorp had substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products throughout several of its lines of business. These exposures included derivative contracts with a total notional value of approximately $102 billion, loans outstanding of approximately $31 billion, preferred stock of approximately $1.4 billion and long-term debt of approximately $237 million. The Bancorp currently estimates that approximately 12% of the existing exposures will mature before June 30, 2023. For the contracts that will not mature prior to June 30, 2023, an additional portion of these contracts is subject to contractual terms specifying alternative reference rates (&#8220;fallback provisions&#8221;) that would become effective upon cessation of LIBOR&#8217;s publication. Existing exposures without fallback provisions are expected to either be amended prior to June 30, 2023 to include such provisions or to transition to an alternative reference rate pursuant to the terms of the LIBOR Act and its related regulations. 

For a further discussion of the various risks the Bancorp faces in connection with the replacement of LIBOR on its operations, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Market Risks&#8212;The replacement of LIBOR could adversely affect Fifth Third&#8217;s revenue or expenses and the value of those assets or obligations.&#8221; in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Key Performance Indicators 

The Bancorp, as a banking institution, utilizes various key indicators of financial condition and operating results in managing and monitoring the performance of the business. In addition to traditional financial metrics, such as revenue and expense trends, the Bancorp monitors other financial measures that assist in evaluating growth trends, capital strength and operational efficiencies. The Bancorp analyzes these key performance indicators against its past performance, its forecasted performance and with the performance of its peer banking institutions. These indicators may change from time to time as the operating environment and businesses change. 

The following are some of the key indicators used by management to assess the Bancorp&#8217;s business performance, including those which are considered in the Bancorp&#8217;s compensation programs: 

&#8226; CET1 Capital Ratio: CET1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets as defined by the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets 

&#8226; Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (non-GAAP): Tangible net income available to common shareholders divided by average tangible common equity 

&#8226; Net Interest Margin (non-GAAP): Net interest income on an FTE basis divided by average interest-earning assets 

&#8226; Efficiency Ratio (non-GAAP): Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income 

&#8226; Earnings Per Share, Diluted: Net income allocated to common shareholders divided by average common shares outstanding after the effect of dilutive stock-based awards 

&#8226; Nonperforming Portfolio Assets Ratio: Nonperforming portfolio assets divided by portfolio loans and leases and OREO 

&#8226; Net Charge-off Ratio: Net losses charged-off divided by average portfolio loans and leases 

&#8226; Return on Average Assets: Net income divided by average assets 

&#8226; Loan-to-Deposit Ratio: Total loans divided by total deposits 

&#8226; Household Growth: Change in the number of consumer households with retail relationship-based checking accounts 

The list of indicators above is intended to summarize some of the most important metrics utilized by management in evaluating the Bancorp&#8217;s performance and does not represent an all-inclusive list of all performance measures that may be considered relevant or important to management or investors.

Earnings Summary 

The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2022 was $631 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, which was net of $22 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2021 was $684 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, which was net of $20 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $1.6 billion, or $2.34 per diluted share, which was net of $78 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $2.0 billion, or $2.83 per diluted share, which was net of $75 million in preferred stock dividends. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $310 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income benefited from increases in market interest rates, resulting in increases in yields on average commercial loans and leases, average other short-term investments and average consumer loans for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from increases in average taxable securities and average commercial and industrial loans for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. These positive impacts were partially offset by an increase in rates paid on average interest checking deposits and an increase in the average balance of FHLB advances as well as a decrease in interest income recognized from PPP loans for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $4.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $460 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income benefited from increases in market interest rates, resulting in increases in yields on average commercial loans and leases and average other short-term investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. Additionally, net interest income benefited from increases in average taxable securities, average commercial and industrial loans and average indirect secured consumer loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from a decrease in average long-term debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. These positive impacts were partially offset by an increase in rates paid on average interest checking deposits and an increase in the average balance of FHLB advances for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. Additionally, interest income recognized from PPP loans decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 3.22% and 2.91% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to 2.59% and 2.61% for the same periods in the prior year. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The provision for credit losses was $158 million and $383 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to a benefit from credit losses of $42 million and $330 million during the same periods in the prior year. The increases in provision expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily driven by factors that caused increases in the ACL during those periods including higher period-end loan and lease balances and deterioration in forecasted macroeconomic conditions. The increase in provision expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was also driven by the initial recognition of provision expense on loans acquired as part of a business acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2022. Net losses charged off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were 0.21% and 0.08% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and 0.18% and 0.17% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO were 0.46% and 0.47%, respectively. For further discussion on credit quality, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Noninterest income decreased $164 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in other noninterest income, commercial banking revenue, leasing business revenue and mortgage banking net revenue. 

Noninterest income decreased $295 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in mortgage banking net revenue, commercial banking revenue, leasing business revenue and other noninterest income. 

Noninterest expense decreased $5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits, partially offset by increases in technology and communications expense and marketing expense. 

Noninterest expense decreased $40 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in compensation and benefits and card and processing expense, partially offset by increases in technology and communications expense, other noninterest expense and marketing expense. 

For more information on net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense refer to the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A. 

Capital Summary 

The Bancorp calculated its regulatory capital ratios under the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets and pursuant to the five-year transition provision option to phase in the effects of CECL on regulatory capital as of September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2022, the Bancorp&#8217;s capital ratios, as defined by the U.S. banking agencies, were: 

&#8226; CET1 capital ratio: 9.14%; 

&#8226; Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio: 10.40%; 

&#8226; Total risk-based capital ratio: 12.64%; 

&#8226; Leverage ratio: 8.44%.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The following are non-GAAP financial measures which provide useful insight to the reader of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements but should be supplemental to primary U.S. GAAP measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for the primary U.S. GAAP measures. The Bancorp encourages readers to consider its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income on an FTE basis, interest income on an FTE basis, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio to U.S. GAAP:

The Bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial institutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization.

The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio and tangible common equity ratio, in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. As U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. 

The following table reconciles non-GAAP capital ratios to U.S. GAAP:

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of the significant new accounting standards applicable to the Bancorp and the expected impact of significant accounting standards issued, but not yet required to be adopted. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the Bancorp&#8217;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Bancorp&#8217;s critical accounting policies include the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. There have been no material changes to the valuation techniques or models during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest incurred on core deposits and wholesale funding. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Tables 5 and 6 present the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, as well as the relative impact of changes in the average balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses included in average other assets. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $310 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income benefited from increases in market interest rates, resulting in increases in yields on average loans and leases and average other short-term investments for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from increases in average taxable securities of $20.4 billion and average commercial and industrial loans of $8.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. These positive impacts were partially offset by an increase in rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits of 37 bps and an increase in the average balance of FHLB advances of $6.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. Interest income recognized from PPP loans decreased to $6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $47 million for the same period in the prior year. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $4.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $460 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income benefited from increases in market interest rates, resulting in increases in yields on average loans and leases and average other short-term investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. Additionally, net interest income benefited from increases in average taxable securities, average commercial and industrial loans and average indirect secured consumer loans of $14.5 billion, $6.1 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from a decrease in average long-term debt of $2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. These positive impacts were partially offset by an increase in rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits of 12 bps and an increase in the average balance of FHLB advances of $3.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. Additionally, interest income recognized from PPP loans decreased to $38 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $153 million for the same period in the prior year. 

Net interest rate spread on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.91% and 2.70% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to 2.45% and 2.46% in the same periods in the prior year. Yields on average interest-earning assets increased 97 bps and 39 bps, partially offset by increases in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities of 51 bps and 15 bps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 3.22% and 2.91% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to 2.59% and 2.61% for the comparable periods in the prior year. Net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was positively impacted by the previously mentioned increases in the net interest rate spread. Net interest margin results are expected to continue increasing as rates rise and assets reprice more than liabilities. 

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from loans and leases increased $301 million and $300 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, driven by the previously mentioned increases in market interest rates and average loan and lease balances, partially offset by lower income from PPP loans. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s loan and lease po rtfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A. Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from investment securities and other short-term investments increased $168 million and $298 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to the previously mentioned increases in average taxable securities and yields on average other short-term investments. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was partially offset by a decrease in yields on average taxable securities of 15 bps from the same period in the prior year. 

Interest expense on core deposits increased $90 million and $92 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to increases in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 41 bps and 18 bps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, from 4 bps and 6 bps for 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively , as a result of increasing short-term interest rates. R efer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s deposits. 

In terest expense on average wholesale funding increased $69 million and $46 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily due to the previously mentioned increases in the average balances of FHLB advances and increases in rates paid on average long-term debt. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of long-term debt of $2.2 billion from the same period in the prior year. Refer to the Borrowings subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s borrowings. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, average wholesale funding represented 18% and 14%, respectively, of average interest-bearing liabilities, compared to 12% and 14%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, see the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A.

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Bancorp provides, as an expense, an amount for expected credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded commitments and letters of credit that is based on factors previously discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses expected in the portfolios. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the ALLL. The amount of loans and leases actually removed from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and leases. 

The provision for credit losses was $158 million and $383 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to a benefit from credit losses of $42 million and $330 million during the same periods in the prior year. Provision expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by factors which caused increases in the ACL during those periods including higher period-end loan and lease balances and deterioration in forecasted macroeconomic conditions. The increase in provision expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was also driven by the initial recognition of provision expense on loans acquired as part of a business acquisition during the second quarter of 2022. The benefit from credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was driven by decreases in the ACL in response to improved economic forecasts and improved commercial and consumer credit quality. 

The ALLL increased $207 million from December 31, 2021 to $2.1 billion at September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2022, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases increased to 1.75%, compared to 1.69% at December 31, 2021. The reserve for unfunded commitments increased $17 million from December 31, 2021 to $199 million at September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2022, the ACL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases increased to 1.91%, compared to 1.85% at December 31, 2021. 

Refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on the provision for credit losses, including an analysis of loan and lease portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and determining the level of the ACL. 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income decreased $164 million and $295 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

The following table presents the components of noninterest income:

Service charges on deposits 

Service charges on deposits consisted of $105 million and $331 million of service charges on commercial deposits and $38 million and $118 million of service charges on consumer deposits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. Service charges on deposits consisted of $110 million and $325 million of service charges on commercial deposits and $42 million and $120 million of service charges on consumer deposits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. Service charges on deposits decreased $9 million and increased $4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily driven by higher treasury management earnings credits. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to an increase in commercial treasury management fees. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Wealth and asset management revenue 

Wealth and asset management revenue decreased $6 million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily driven by a decrease in private client service fees. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily driven by decreases in securities income and private client service fees. The Bancorp&#8217;s trust and registered investment advisory businesses had approximately $494 billion and $541 billion in total assets under care as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and managed $52 billion and $61 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Commercial banking revenue 

Commercial banking revenue decreased $18 million and $59 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily driven by decreases in corporate bond fees, loan syndication fees and merger and acquisition fees, partially offset by increases in contract revenue from commodity derivatives and commercial customer derivatives. 

Card and processing revenue 

Card and processing revenue increased $3 million and $8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to an increase in credit card interchange, partially offset by increased reward costs as well as a decrease in other EFT income. The increases in credit card interchange and reward costs were driven by an increase in consumer and business card spend volumes. 

Leasing business revenue 

Leasing business revenue decreased $18 million and $47 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decreases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily due to decreases in leasing business solutions revenue, partially offset by increases in lease remarketing fees. The decreases in leasing business solutions revenue were related to the disposition of LaSalle Solutions during the second quarter of 2022. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 also included a decrease in lease syndication fees. 

Mortgage banking net revenue 

Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $17 million and $83 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

The following table presents the components of mortgage banking net revenue: 

TABLE 8: Components of Mortgage Banking Net Revenue For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, ($ in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Origination fees and gains on loan sales $ 24 &#160; 78 73 &#160; 248 Net mortgage servicing revenue: Gross mortgage servicing fees 81 &#160; 63 230 &#160; 181 Net valuation adjustments on MSRs and free-standing derivatives purchased to economically hedge MSRs

Origination fees and gains on loan sales decreased $54 million and $175 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily driven by decreases in gain on sale margins and lower volume as well as the impact of gains recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 from sales of forbearance loans that were repurchased from GNMA. Residential mortgage loan originations decreased to $4.0 billion and $11.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, from $5.0 billion and $14.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, due to the impact of higher market interest rates on refinance activity. 

Net mortgage servicing revenue increased $37 million and $92 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to increases in gross mortgage servicing fees and decreases in net negative valuation adjustments. Refer to Table 9 for the components of net valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio and the impact of the Bancorp&#8217;s non-qualifying hedging strategy. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

The Bancorp recognized income of $48 million and $217 million for three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and losses of $44 million and $95 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, in mortgage banking net revenue for valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio. The valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio included increases of $83 million and $358 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and increases of $20 million and $123 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, due to changes in market rates and other inputs in the valuation model, including future prepayment speeds and OAS assumptions. Mortgage rates increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, which resulted in a reduction to modeled prepayment speeds and a widening of the spread between mortgage rates and swap rates. There was also a decrease in the modeled OAS assumptions for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and an increase in the modeled OAS assumptions for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The fair value of the MSR portfolio decreased $35 million and $141 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and decreased $64 million and $218 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, as a result of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity. 

Further detail on the valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation of the MSR portfolio. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. 

In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp acquires various securities as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. The Bancorp recognized net losses of $1 million and $2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to net losses of an immaterial amount and $2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, recorded in securities losses, net &#8211; non-qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights in the Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s total residential mortgage loans serviced as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 were $120.3 billion and $92.7 billion, respectively, with $102.7 billion and $77.9 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others. 

Other noninterest income 

The following table presents the components of other noninterest income: 

TABLE 10: Components of Other Noninterest Income For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, ($ in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Private equity investment income $ 14 &#160; 22 55 &#160; 41 BOLI income 15 &#160; 16 48 &#160; 46 Cardholder fees 14 &#160; 13 41 &#160; 38 Banking center income 6 &#160; 6 18 &#160; 17 Equity method investment income 4 &#160; 3 17 &#160; 24 Consumer loan fees 5 &#160; 4 15 &#160; 13 Gains on contract sales 1 &#160; 61 2 &#160; 62 Loss on swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Other noninterest income decreased $61 million and $16 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in gains on contract sales. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was partially offset by a decrease in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares and an increase in private equity investment income. 

Gains on contract sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily included the recognition of a $60 million gain on the sale of the Bancorp&#8217;s HSA deposit portfolio, which was completed in the third quarter of 2021. The Bancorp recognized negative valuation adjustments of $46 million related to the Visa total return swap during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to negative valuation adjustments of $67 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. For additional information on the valuation of the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares, refer to Note 22 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Private equity investment income increased $14 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by gains recognized on certain private equity investments. 

Noninterest Expense 

Noninterest expense decreased $5 million and $40 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. 

The following table presents the components of noninterest expense:

Compensation and benefits expense decreased $22 million and $71 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in non-qualified deferred compensation expense and performance-based compensation, partially offset by the additional personnel costs of an acquired business as well as the impact of raising the Bancorp&#8217;s minimum wage in the third quarter of 2022. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was partially offset by the impact of a special broad-based compensation bonus granted in the first quarter of 2022. Full-time equivalent employees totaled 19,187 at September 30, 2022 compared to 19,171 at September 30, 2021. 

Technology and communications expense increased $8 million and $21 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increased investment in strategic initiatives and technology. Marketing expense increased $6 million and $15 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to an increase in account acquisition programs. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was also driven by increased advertising. 

Card and processing expense decreased $11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to contract renegotiations with a third-party vendor. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following table presents the components of other noninterest expense: 

TABLE 12: Components of Other Noninterest Expense For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, ($ in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Loan and lease $ 40 &#160; 54 127 &#160; 158 FDIC insurance and other taxes 37 &#160; 29 101 &#160; 87 Losses and adjustments 26 &#160; 19 62 &#160; 49 Data processing 21 &#160; 19 61 &#160; 60 Travel 15 &#160; 12 45 &#160; 22 Professional service fees 16 &#160; 14 42 &#160; 46 Intangible amortization 12 &#160; 11 34 &#160; 32 Postal and courier 10 &#160; 9 30 &#160; 28 Other, net 80 &#160; 86 219 &#160; 222 Total other noninterest expense $ 257 &#160; 253 721 &#160; 704 

Other noninterest expense increased $4 million and $17 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in FDIC insurance and other taxes and losses and adjustments, partially offset by a decrease in loan and lease expense. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 also included an increase in travel expense. 

FDIC insurance and other taxes increased $8 million and $14 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in the FDIC insurance assessment rate. Losses and adjustments increased $7 million and $13 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to increases in operational losses and legal settlements. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to a reduction in the net benefit from changes in credit valuation adjustments on customer accommodation derivatives and an increase in operational losses, partially offset by a decrease in legal settlements. Travel expense increased $23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase in travel as a result of the gradual cessation of travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Loan and lease expense decreased $14 million and $31 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by a decrease in loan servicing expenses related to the Bancorp&#8217;s sales of certain government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans that were previously in forbearance programs and serviced by a third party. 

Applicable Income Taxes 

The Bancorp&#8217;s income before income taxes, applicable income tax expense and effective tax rate are as follows: 

TABLE 13: Applicable Income Taxes For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, ($ in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Income before income taxes $ 845 &#160; 895 2,179 &#160; 2,689 Applicable income tax expense 192 &#160; 191 470 &#160; 582 Effective tax rate 22.7 &#160; &#160;% 21.3 21.6 &#160; 21.6 

Applicable income tax expense for all periods presented includes the benefit from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, and tax credits (and other related tax benefits), partially offset by the effect of proportional amortization of qualifying LIHTC investments and certain nondeductible expenses. The tax credits are primarily associated with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program established under Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC, the Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC and the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program established under Section 1397E of the IRC. 

The effective tax rate increased to 22.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 21.3% for the same period in the prior year primarily related to a decrease in excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation and an increase in the amount of nondeductible expenses. The effective tax rate was 21.6% for both the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

Loans and Leases 

The Bancorp classifies its commercial loans and leases based upon primary purpose and consumer loans based upon product or collateral. Table 14 summarizes end of period loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale, and Table 15 summarizes average total loans and leases, including average loans and leases held for sale.

(a) Includes $210 million and $1.3 billion as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, related to the SBA&#8217;s Paycheck Protection Program. 

Total loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale, increased $5.5 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of a $5.6 billion, or 8%, increase in commercial loans and leases. 

Commercial loans and leases increased $5.6 billion from December 31, 2021 due to increases in commercial and industrial loans, commercial mortgage loans and commercial construction loans, partially offset by a decrease in commercial leases. Commercial and industrial loans increased $4.8 billion, or 9%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of increased revolving line of credit utilization and stronger production, partially offset by PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns. Commercial mortgage loans increased $618 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2021 as loan originations exceeded payoffs. Commercial construction loans increased $332 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2021 as draws on existing commitments and loan originations exceeded payoffs. Commercial leases decreased $231 million, or 8%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship-based lease originations. 

Consumer loans decreased $84 million from December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in residential mortgage loans, indirect secured consumer loans and home equity, partially offset by an increase in other consumer loans. Residential mortgage loans decreased $1.3 billion, or 6%, from December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp sold government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs. Indirect secured consumer loans decreased $137 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by indirect automobile payoffs exceeding loan production, partially offset by increased loan production in non-automobile indirect loans. Home equity decreased $84 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2021 as payoffs exceeded loan originations and new advances. Other consumer loans increased $1.5 billion, or 53%, from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by the impacts of a business acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2022, including loans acquired in addition to post-acquisition loan originations exceeding payoffs.

Average loans and leases, including average loans and leases held for sale, increased $8.4 billion, or 7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of a $8.7 billion, or 13%, increase in average commercial loans and leases, partially offset by a $377 million, or 1%, decrease in average consumer loans. 

Average commercial loans and leases increased $8.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by decreases in average commercial leases and average commercial construction loans. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $8.9 billion, or 19%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increased revolving line of credit utilization and increased production, partially offset by PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns. Average commercial mortgage loans increased $412 million, or 4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year as loan originations exceeded payoffs. Average commercial leases decreased $365 million, or 12%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship-based lease originations. Average commercial construction loans decreased $172 million, or 3%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year as payoffs exceeded draws on existing commitments and loan originations. 

Average consumer loans decreased $377 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in average residential mortgage loans and average home equity, partially offset by increases in average indirect secured consumer loans and average other consumer loans. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $1.9 billion, or 9%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp sold government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs. Average home equity decreased $453 million, or 10%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year as payoffs exceeded loan originations and new advances. Average indirect secured consumer loans increased $1.2 billion, or 7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by higher demand and other favorable market conditions from September 30, 2021, which contributed to increased loan production. Average other consumer loans increased $788 million, or 26%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the impacts of a business acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2022, including loans acquired in addition to post-acquisition loan originations exceeding payoffs. 

Investment Securities 

The Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing collateral for pledging purposes and for liquidity risk management. Total investment securities were $52.0 billion a nd $39.0 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The taxable available-for-sale debt and other investment securities portfolio had an effective duration o f 5.5 at September 30, 2022 compared to 4.8 at December 31, 2021. 

Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in management&#8217;s judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. Securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities are classified as trading when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the ne ar term. At September 30, 2022, the B ancorp&#8217;s investment portfolio consisted primarily o f AAA-rated available-for-sale debt and other 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

securities. The Bancorp held an immaterial amount of below-investment grade available-for-sale debt and other securities at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Bancorp recognized $12 million and $19 million, respectively, of impairment losses on its available-for-sale debt and other securities, included in securities (losses) gains, net, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. These losses related to certain securities in unrealized loss positions that the Bancorp intended to sell prior to recovery of their amortized cost bases. The Bancorp did not consider these losses to be credit-related. 

At both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Bancorp completed its evaluation of the available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position and did not recognize an allowance for credit losses. The Bancorp did not recognize provision expense related to available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of investment securities:

(a) Other securities consist of FHLB, FRB and DTCC restricted stock hold ings that are carried at cost. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities in creased $20.4 billion f rom December 31, 2021 as a result of the deployment of excess short-term investments into longer duration assets in the investment portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities wer e 31% an d 20% of total interest-earning assets at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities port folio was 7.1 years at September 30, 2022 compared to 6.6 years at December 31, 2021. In addition, at September 30, 2022, the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 2.88% compared to 2.77% at December 31, 2021. 

Information presented in Table 17 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is presented on an FTE basis and is computed using amortized cost balances and reflects the impact of prepayments. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio exclude other securities that have no stated yield or maturity. Total net unrealized losses on the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio were $6.1 billion at September 30, 2022 compared to net unrealized gains of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of the Bancorp&#8217;s investment securities portfolio generally decreases when interest rates increase or when credit spreads widen.

Other Short-Term Investments 

Other short-term investments primarily include overnight interest-earning investments, including reserves held at the FRB. The Bancorp uses other short-term investments as part of its liquidity risk management tools. Other short-term investments wer e $6.6 billion and $34.6 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The decrease of $28.0 billion from December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to purchases of investment securities, a decline in core deposit balances and loan growth during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

Deposits 

The Bancorp&#8217;s deposit balances represent an important source of funding and revenue growth opportunity. The Bancorp continues to focus on core deposit growth in its retail and commercial franchises by improving customer satisfaction, building full relationships and offering competitive rates. Average core deposits represented 76% and 79% of the Bancorp&#8217;s average asset funding base for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(a) Includes retail brokered certificates of deposit. 

Core deposits decreased $9.8 billion, or 6%, from December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in demand deposits, interest checking deposits, money market deposits and CDs $250,000 or less, partially offset by an increase in savings deposits. Demand deposits decreased $7.5 billion, or 12%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of lower balances per commercial customer account and balance migration into interest checking deposits, partially offset by consumer balance growth. Interest checking deposits decreased $1.9 billion, or 4% from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of lower balances per customer account, partially offset by balance migration from demand deposits and money market deposits. Money market deposits decreased $1.6 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of lower balances per commercial customer account and balance migration into interest checking deposits, partially offset by higher balances per consumer customer account. The decreases in demand deposits, interest checking deposits and money market deposits also reflected the impact of the deliberate runoff during the second quarter of 2022 of higher cost commercial deposits. CDs $250,000 or less decreased $479 million, or 19%, from December 31, 2021 primarily due to lower offering rates. Savings deposits increased $1.5 billion, or 7%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of consumer balance growth. 

CDs over $250,000 increased $2.1 billion from December 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in retail brokered certificates of deposit issued.

On an average basis, core deposits decreased $5.1 billion, or 3%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in average demand deposits, average interest checking deposits, average money market deposits and average CDs $250,000 or less, partially offset by an increase in average savings deposits. Average demand deposits decreased $3.1 billion, or 5%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of lower average balances per commercial customer account and balance migration into interest checking deposits, partially offset by higher average balances per consumer customer account. Average interest checking deposits decreased $2.6 billion, or 6%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of lower average balances per commercial customer account, partially offset by balance migration from demand deposits and money market deposits. Average money market deposits decreased $1.4 billion, or 5%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of lower average balances per commercial customer account and balance migration into interest checking deposits, partially offset by 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

higher average balances per consumer customer account. The decreases in average demand deposits, average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits also reflected the impact of the deliberate runoff during the second quarter of 2022 of higher cost commercial deposits. Average CDs $250,000 or less decreased $889 million, or 30%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower offering rates. Average savings deposits increased $2.9 billion, or 14%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of consumer balance growth. 

Average CDs over $250,000 increased $1.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in retail brokered certificates of deposit issued. 

Contractual maturities 

The contractual maturities of CDs as of September 30, 2022 are summarized in the following table:

(a) Includes CDs $250,000 or less and CDs over $250,000. 

Deposit insurance 

The FDIC generally provides a standard amount of insurance of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category defined by the FDIC. Depositors may qualify for coverage of accounts over $250,000 if they have funds in different ownership categories and all FDIC requirements are met. All deposits that an account holder has in the same ownership category at the same bank are added together and insured up to the standard insurance amount. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, approximately $64.9 billion and $80.2 billion, respectively, of the Bancorp&#8217;s domestic deposits were uninsured. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, approximately $425 million and $468 million, respectively, of the Bancorp&#8217;s time deposits were not fully insured. The estimated uninsured portions of those time deposits were $183 million and $236 million at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Where information is not readily available to determine the amount of insured deposits, the amount of uninsured deposits is estimated, consistent with the methodologies and assumptions utilized in providing information to the Bank&#8217;s regulators. 

Borrowings 

The Bancorp accesses a variety of short-term and long-term funding sources. Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term and include federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. Total average borrowings as a percent of average interest-bearing liabilities we re 17% and 12% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of borrowings:

Total borr owings increased $5.2 billion, or 40%, fro m December 31, 2021 primarily due to increases in other short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in long-term debt. Other short-term borrowings increased $5.4 billion from December 31, 2021 primarily due to increased funding needs resulting from an increase in investment securities, loan growth and a decline in core deposit balances. T he level of other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and the sources that are used to satisfy those needs. For further information on the components of other short-term borrowings, ref er to Note 15 of th e Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-term d ebt decreased $109 million f rom December 31, 2021 primarily driven by the early redemptions under the par call options of $1.5 billion of notes, $493 million of fair value adjustments associated with interest rate swaps hedging long-term debt and $141 million of paydo wns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. These decreases were partially offset by the issuances of senior fixed-rate/floating-rate notes in April and July of 2022 totaling $2.0 billion. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information

Total average borrowin gs increased $6.3 billion, or 47%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in average other short-term borrowings and average federal funds purchased, partially offset by a decrease in average long-term debt. Average other short-term borrowings and average federal funds purchased increased $6.3 billion and $259 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased funding needs resulting from an increase in investment securities, loan growth and a decline in core deposit balances. Average long-term deb t decreased $261 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same peri od in the prior year primarily driven by the early redemptions under the par call options of $1.5 billion of notes, $507 million of fair value adjustments associated with interest rate swaps hedging long-term debt and $200 million of paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations since September 30, 2021. The decrease in average long-term debt was partially offset by the issuances of senior fixed-rate/floating-rate notes in November of 2021, April of 2022 and July of 2022 of $500 million, $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. Information on the average rates paid on borrowings is discussed in the Net Interest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A. In addition, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for a discussion on the role of borrowings in the Bancorp&#8217;s liquidity management. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW 

During the third quarter of 2022, the Bancorp reorganized its management reporting structure and now reports on three business segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Small Business Banking and Wealth and Asset Management. Additional information on each business segment is included in Note 23 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior period results have been adjusted to conform to the new segment presentation. Results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management&#8217;s accounting practices and businesses change. 

The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp&#8217;s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third&#8217;s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing. 

The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. In general, the charge rates on assets decreased throughout 2021, but have increased since December 31, 2021 as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. The credit rates for deposit products also increased since December 31, 2021, due to higher interest rates and modified assumptions. Thus, net interest income for asset-generating business segments was negatively impacted by the rates charged on assets while deposit-providing business segments were positively impacted during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for allocating provision for credit losses to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. Provision for credit losses attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of relationship depth opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit.

Average commercial leases decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship-based lease originations. 

Average deposits decreased $9.5 billion and $4.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to decreases in average interest checking deposits, average savings and money market deposits and average demand deposits. Average interest checking deposits decreased $3.5 billion and $2.1 billion, average savings and money market deposits decreased $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion and average demand deposits decreased $3.9 billion and $677 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of lower average balances per commercial customer account.

General Corporate and Other 

General Corporate and Other includes the unallocated portion of the investment securities portfolio, securities gains and losses, certain non-core deposit funding, unassigned equity, unallocated provision for credit losses expense or a benefit from the reduction of the ACL, the payment of preferred stock dividends and certain support activities and other items not attributed to the business segments. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis decreased $352 million and $865 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in FTP credits on deposits allocated to the business segments as well as decreases in interest income on loans and leases. These negative impacts were partially offset by increases in the benefit related to FTP charge rates on loans and leases allocated to the business segments as well as increases in interest income on investment securities. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $63 million and increased $191 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease in provision expense for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by the impact of allocations to the business segments, partially offset by factors which caused an increase in the ACL during this period including higher period-end loan and lease balances and deterioration in forecasted macroeconomic conditions. The increase in provision expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by factors which caused an increase in the ACL during this period including higher period-end loan and lease balances and deterioration in forecasted macroeconomic conditions, partially offset by the impact of allocations to the business segments. 

Noninterest income decreased $66 million and $100 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by a $60 million gain on the sale of the Bancorp&#8217;s HSA deposit portfolio in the third quarter of 2021. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was also driven by increases in net securities losses, partially offset by a decrease in the loss recognized on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares. 

Noninterest expense decreased $36 million and $101 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in compensation and benefits due to decreases in benefits expense, variable compensation and deferred compensation. The decreases also included the impact of increases in corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments, partially offset by increases in technology and communications expense and travel expense.

RISK MANAGEMENT - OVERVIEW 

The Risk Management Overview section included in Item 7 of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K describes the Bancorp&#8217;s Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Three Lines of Defense structure as well as key areas of risk, which include credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, price risk, legal and regulatory compliance risk, operational risk, reputation risk and strategic risk. Item 7 of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K also includes additional detailed information about the Bancorp&#8217;s processes related to operational risk management as well as legal and regulatory compliance risk management. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT 

The objective of the Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the Bancorp. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. The Bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices which are described below. These practices include the use of intentional risk-based limits for single name exposures and counterparty selection criteria designed to reduce or eliminate exposure to borrowers who have higher than average default risk and defined weaknesses in financial performance. The Bancorp carefully designs and monitors underwriting, documentation and collection standards. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Credit officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority amounts, the utilization of which is closely monitored. Underwriting activities are centrally managed, and Credit Risk Management manages the policy and the authority delegation process directly. The Credit Risk Review function provides independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk grades and the charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the ACL is based on quarterly assessments of the estimated losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp uses these assessments to promptly identify potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio, maintain an adequate ACL and record any necessary charge-offs. The Bancorp defines potential problem loans and leases as those rated substandard that do not meet the definition of a nonaccrual loan or a restructured loan. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s credit grade categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions. In addition, stress testing is performed on various commercial and consumer portfolios utilizing various models. For certain portfolios, such as real estate and leveraged lending, stress testing is performed by Credit department personnel at the individual loan level during credit underwriting. 

The following tables provide a summary of potential problem portfolio loans and leases:

In addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems. The first of these risk grading systems encompasses ten categories, which are based on regulatory guidance for credit risk systems. These ratings are used by the Bancorp to monitor and manage its credit risk. The Bancorp also maintains a dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing, portfolio monitoring and capital allocation that includes a &#8220;through-the-cycle&#8221; rating philosophy for assessing a borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness. A &#8220;through-the-cycle&#8221; rating philosophy uses a grading scale that assigns ratings based on average default rates through an entire business cycle for borrowers with similar financial performance. The dual risk rating system includes thirteen probabilities of default grade categories and an additional eleven grade categories for estimating 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

losses given an event of default. The probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the ten-category regulatory risk rating system. 

The Bancorp utilizes internally developed models to estimate expected credit losses for portfolio loans and leases. For loans and leases that are collectively evaluated, the Bancorp utilizes these models to forecast expected credit losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for additional information about the Bancorp&#8217;s processes for developing these models, estimating credit losses for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period and for estimating credit losses for individually evaluated loans. 

For the commercial portfolio segment, the estimated probabilities of default are primarily based on the probability of default ratings assigned under the through-the-cycle dual risk rating system and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. 

For collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower&#8217;s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The Bancorp also utilizes various scoring systems, analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring processes to assess the credit risk of the consumer and residential mortgage portfolios. 

Overview 

Financial conditions continued to tighten in the third quarter as persistent inflation led the FOMC to aggressively increase interest rates to restore price stability and long-term treasury rates increased to their highest levels since 2010. The dramatic rise in the dollar against other global currencies is threatening global growth and adding to the inflationary pressures in other countries. Global central banks are expected to continue to aggressively increase interest rates, despite driving weaker growth, as they attempt to stabilize their currencies and offset the inflationary strain from commodities priced in dollars. 

Financial market volatility remained high throughout the third quarter as investors assessed the impact of the FOMC&#8217;s aggressive rate hikes on the macroeconomic outlook. Despite having increased rates 300 basis points since December 31, 2021, FRB officials indicated that additional rate hikes were necessary as high inflation continues to persist and unemployment remains at historically low levels. The FRB pushed back against market expectations for a pivot in monetary policy, indicating that a longer period of tighter policy will be necessary to return inflation to its long-run target of 2%. With the FOMC moving monetary policy into a restrictive setting, the increase in real yields along with the inversion of the yield curve are signaling increasing risks of a recession. 

The dramatic increase in household wealth since March 2020 has supported consumer demand to date. However, higher prices are threatening to erode consumer&#8217;s living standards and may result in pressures on discretionary spending as essential items consume a greater share of consumers&#8217; income. Many businesses are also facing a more challenging environment as profit margins are pressured from higher inflation and supply chain disruptions. 

Commercial Portfolio 

The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy seeks to minimize concentrations of risk through diversification. The Bancorp has commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of business within the commercial segment, geography and credit product type. The risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and continuous portfolio risk management reporting. 

The Bancorp is closely monitoring various economic conditions and their impacts on commercial borrowers, including the pace of inflation, rising interest rates, labor and supply chain issues, and changes in consumer discretionary spending patterns, among others. The Bancorp maintains focus on disciplined client selection, adherence to underwriting policy and attention to borrower and industry concentrations. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The Bancorp provides loans to a variety of customers ranging from large multinational firms to middle market businesses, sole proprietors and high net worth individuals. The origination policies for commercial and industrial loans outline the risks and underwriting requirements for loans to businesses in various industries. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, collateral and leverage requirements, cash flow coverage measures and hold limits. The Bancorp aligns credit and sales teams with specific industry expertise to better monitor and manage different industry segments of the portfolio. 

The following table provides detail on commercial loans and leases by industry classification (as defined by the North American Industry Classification System), by loan size and by state, illustrating the diversity and granularity of the Bancorp&#8217;s commercial loans and leases as of:

The origination policies for commercial real estate outline the risks and underwriting requirements for owner and nonowner-occupied and construction lending. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, maximum LTVs, minimum debt service coverage ratios, construction loan monitoring procedures, appraisal requirements, pre-leasing requirements (as applicable), pro forma analysis requirements and interest rate sensitivity. The Bancorp requires a valuation of real estate collateral, which may include third-party appraisals, be performed at the time of origination and renewal in accordance with regulatory requirements and on an as-needed basis when market conditions justify. Although the Bancorp does not back test these collateral value assumptions, the Bancorp maintains an appraisal review department to order and review third-party appraisals in accordance with regulatory requirements. Collateral values on criticized assets with relationships exceeding $1 million are reviewed quarterly to assess the appropriateness of the value ascribed in the assessment of charge-offs and specific reserves. 

The Bancorp assesses all real estate and non-real estate collateral securing a loan and considers all cross-collateralized loans in the calculation of the LTV ratio. The following tables provide detail on the most recent LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans greater than $1 million, excluding commercial mortgage loans that are individually evaluated. The Bancorp does not typically aggregate the LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans less than $1 million.

Consumer Portfolio 

Consumer credit risk management utilizes a framework that encompasses consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting credit risk. These processes are supported by a credit risk governance structure that includes Board oversight, policies, risk limits and risk committees. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s consumer portfolio is materially comprised of five categories of loans: residential mortgage loans, home equity, indirect secured consumer loans, credit card and other consumer loans. The Bancorp has identified certain credit characteristics within these five categories of loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio. The Bancorp does not update LTVs for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except as part of the charge-off process for real estate secured loans. The Bancorp actively manages the consumer portfolio through concentration limits, which mitigate credit risk through limiting the exposure to lower FICO scores, higher LTVs and specific geographic concentration risks. 

The Bancorp continues to ensure that underwriting standards and guidelines adequately account for the broader economic conditions that the consumer portfolio faces in a rising-rate environment. Guidelines are designed to ensure that the various consumer products fall within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite. These guidelines will be monitored and adjusted as deemed appropriate in response to the prevailing economic conditions while remaining within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance limits. 

The payment structures for certain variable rate products (such as residential mortgage loans, home equity and credit card) are susceptible to changes in benchmark interest rates. With continued increases in interest rates, minimum payments on these products also increase, raising the potential for the environment to be disruptive to some borrowers. The Bancorp actively monitors the portion of its consumer portfolio that is susceptible to increases in minimum payments and continues to assess the impact on the overall risk appetite and soundness of the portfolio. 

Residential mortgage portfolio 

The Bancorp manages credit risk in the residential mortgage portfolio through underwriting guidelines that limit exposure to higher LTVs and lower FICO scores. Additionally, the portfolio is governed by concentration limits that ensure geographic, product and channel diversification. The Bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio. 

The Bancorp does not originate residential mortgage loans that permit customers to defer principal payments or make payments that are less than the accruing interest. The Bancorp originates both fixed-rate and ARM loans. Within the ARM portfolio, approximately $502 million of ARM loans will have rate resets during the next twelve months. Of these resets, 95% are expected to experience an increase in rate, with an average increase of approximately 1.92%. Underlying characteristics of these borrowers are relatively strong with a weighted average origination DTI of 35% and weighted average origination LTV of 73%. 

Certain residential mortgage products have characteristics that may increase the Bancorp &#8217; s credit loss rates in the event of a decline in housing values. These types of mortgage products offered by the Bancorp include loans with high LTVs, multiple loans secured by the same collateral that when combined result in an LTV greater than 80% and interest-only loans. The Bancorp has deemed residential mortgage loans with greater than 80% LTVs and no mortgage insurance as loans that represent a higher level of risk.

Home equity portfolio 

The Bancorp&#8217;s home equity portfolio is primarily comprised of home equity lines of credit. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, the Bancorp&#8217;s newly originated home equity lines of credit have a 10-year interest-only draw period followed by a 20-year amortization period. The home equity line of credit previously offered by the Bancorp was a revolving facility with a 20-year term, minimum payments of interest-only and a balloon payment of principal at maturity. Approximately 40% of the outstanding balances of the Bancorp&#8217;s portfolio of home equity lines of credit have a balloon structure at maturity. Peak maturity years for the balloon home equity lines of credit are 2025 to 2028 and approximately 16% of the balances mature before 2025. 

The ALLL provides coverage for expected losses in the home equity portfolio. The allowance attributable to the portion of the home equity portfolio that has not been restructured in a TDR is determined on a pooled basis using a probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default model framework to generate expected losses. The expected losses for the home equity portfolio are dependent upon loan 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

delinquency, FICO scores, LTV, loan age and their historical correlation with macroeconomic variables including unemployment and the home price index. The expected losses generated from models are adjusted by certain qualitative adjustment factors to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends. The qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. 

The home equity portfolio is managed in two primary groups: loans outstanding with a combined LTV greater than 80% and those loans with an LTV of 80% or less based upon appraisals at origination. For additional information on these loans, refer to Table 38 and Table 39. Of the total $4.0 billion of outstanding home equity loans: 

&#8226; 79% reside within the Bancorp&#8217;s Midwest footprint of Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky as of September 30, 2022; 

&#8226; 41% are in senior lien positions and 59% are in junior lien positions at September 30, 2022; 

&#8226; 79% of non-delinquent borrowers made at least one payment greater than the minimum payment during the three months ended September 30, 2022; and 

&#8226; The portfolio had a weighted average refreshed FICO score of 751 at September 30, 2022. 

The Bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes adjustments in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Bancorp does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTVs after origination. However, the Bancorp monitors the local housing markets by reviewing various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring processes. For junior lien home equity loans which become 60 days or more past due, the Bancorp tracks the performance of the senior lien loans in which the Bancorp is the servicer and utilizes consumer credit bureau attributes to monitor the status of the senior lien loans that the Bancorp does not service. If the senior lien loan is found to be 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status unless both loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, if the junior lien home equity loan becomes 120 days or more past due and the senior lien loan is also 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is assessed for charge-off.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The Bancorp believes that home equity portfolio loans with a greater than 80% LTV (including senior liens, if applicable) present a higher level of risk. The following table provides an analysis of the home equity portfolio loans outstanding in a senior and junior lien position by LTV at origination as of:

Indirect secured consumer portfolio 

The indirect secured consumer portfolio is comprised of $14.3 billion of automobile loans and $2.3 billion of indirect motorcycle, powersport, recreational vehicle and marine loans as of September 30, 2022. All concentration and guideline changes are monitored monthly to ensure alignment with original credit performance and return projections.

The following table provides an analysis of indirect secured consumer portfolio loans outstanding disaggregated based upon FICO score at origination as of:

It is a common industry practice to advance on these types of loans an amount in excess of the collateral value due to the inclusion of negative equity trade-in, maintenance/warranty products, taxes, title and other fees paid at closing. The Bancorp monitors its exposure to these higher risk loans. 

The following table provides an analysis of indirect secured consumer portfolio loans outstanding by LTV at origination as of:

Other consumer portfolio loans 

Other consumer portfolio loans are comprised of secured and unsecured loans originated through the Bancorp&#8217;s branch network, home improvement and solar energy installation loans originated through a network of contractors and installers, and point-of-sale loans originated or purchased in connection with third-party companies. The Bancorp had $157 million in unfunded commitments associated with loans originated in connection with third-party companies as of September 30, 2022. The Bancorp closely monitors the credit performance of point-of-sale loans. Loans originated in connection with one third-party company are impacted by certain credit loss protection coverage provided by that company. The Bancorp discontinued origination of new loans with this third-party company in September 2022.

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal and/or interest is uncertain; restructured commercial, credit card and consumer loans which do not meet the requirements to be classified as a performing asset; and certain other assets, including OREO and other repossessed property. A summary of nonperforming assets is included in Table 46. For further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s policies related to accounting for delinquent and nonperforming loans and leases, refer to the Nonaccrual Loans and Leases section of Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Nonperforming assets were $546 million at September 30, 2022 compared to $542 million at December 31, 2021. At September 30, 2022, an immaterial amount of nonaccrual loans were held for sale, compared to $15 million at December 31, 2021. 

Nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO were 0.46% and 0.47% at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Nonaccrual loans and leases secured by real estate were 44% of nonaccrual loans and leases as of September 30, 2022 compared to 33% as of December 31, 2021. 

Portfolio commercial nonaccrual loans and leases were $298 million at September 30, 2022, a decrease of $39 million from December 31, 2021. Portfolio consumer nonaccrual loans were $224 million at September 30, 2022, an increase of $63 million from December 31, 2021. Refer to Table 47 for a rollforward of the portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases. 

OREO and other repossessed property was $24 million and $29 million at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The Bancorp recognized an immaterial amount of losses on the transfer, sale or write-down of OREO properties for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The Bancorp recognized an immaterial amount and $6 million in losses on the transfer, sale or write-down of OREO properties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, approximately $9 million and $24 million, respectively, of interest income would have been recognized if the nonaccrual and restructured loans and leases on nonaccrual status had been current in accordance with their contractual terms compared to $6 million and $24 million in the same periods in the prior year. Although these values help demonstrate the costs of carrying nonaccrual credits, the Bancorp does not expect to recover the full amount of interest as nonaccrual loans and leases are generally carried below their principal balance.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

A loan is accounted for as a TDR if the Bancorp, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. TDRs include concessions granted under reorganization, arrangement or other provisions of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. A TDR typically involves a modification of terms such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or remaining principal amount of the loan, a reduction of accrued interest or an extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk. For further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s accounting for TDRs, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Consumer restructured loans on accrual status totaled $733 million and $675 million at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, the percentages of restructured residential mortgage loans, home equity and credit card that were past due 30 days or more from their modified terms were 29%, 19% and 30%, respectively.

Analysis of Net Loan Charge-offs 

Net charge-offs were 21 bps and 8 bps of average portfolio loans and leases for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were 18 bps and 17 bps of average portfolio loans and leases for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Table 51 provides a summary of credit loss experience and net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases outstanding by loan category. 

The ratio of commercial loan and lease net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio commercial loans and leases increased to 17 bps during the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to 3 bps during the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans of $29 million. The ratio of commercial loan and lease net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio commercial loans and leases increased to 14 bps during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to 10 bps during the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans of $31 million, partially offset by a decrease in net charge-offs on commercial mortgage loans of $9 million. 

The ratio of consumer loan net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio consumer loans increased to 28 bps during the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to 16 bps during the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in net charge-offs on indirect secured consumer loans of $11 million. The ratio of consumer loan net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio consumer loans decreased to 26 bps during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to 28 bps during the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in net charge-offs on credit card of $18 million, partially offset by an increase in net charge-offs on indirect secured consumer loans of $15 million.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses is comprised of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. As described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, the Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related loans and leases (as adjusted for prepayments and reasonably expected TDRs). The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans and leases which are individually evaluated. For collectively evaluated loans and leases, the Bancorp uses quantitative models to forecast expected credit losses based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. The Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. 

The Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the ALLL. Qualitative adjustments are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses which are not fully captured within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models. These factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, lending and risk management personnel and results of internal audit and quality control reviews. In addition, the qualitative adjustment framework can be utilized to address specific idiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events, natural disasters or changes in current economic conditions that are not reflected in the quantitative credit loss models, and their effects on regional borrowers and changes in product structures. Qualitative factors may also be used to address the impacts of unforeseen events on key inputs and assumptions within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models, such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period, changes to historical loss information or changes to the reversion period or methodology. 

In addition to the ALLL, the Bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL. The provision for unfunded commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

For the commercial portfolio segment, the estimates for probability of default are primarily based on internal ratings assigned to each commercial borrower on a 13-point scale and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. 

For collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower&#8217;s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. 

At both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Bancorp used three forward-looking economic scenarios during the reasonable and supportable forecast period in its expected credit loss models to address the inherent imprecision in macroeconomic forecasting. Each of the three scenarios was developed by a third party that is subject to the Bancorp&#8217;s Third-Party Risk Management program including oversight by the Bancorp&#8217;s independent model risk management group. The scenarios included a most likely outcome (Baseline) and two less probable scenarios with one being more favorable than the Baseline and the other being less favorable. The more favorable alternative scenario (Upside) depicted a stronger near-term growth outlook while the less favorable outlook (Downside) depicted a moderate recession. The Baseline scenario was developed such that the expectation is that the economy will perform better than the projection 50% of the time and worse than the projection 50% of the time. The Upside scenario was developed such that there is a 10% probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a 90% probability that it will perform worse. The Downside scenario was developed such that there is a 90% probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a 10% probability that it will perform worse. 

September 30, 2022 ACL 

The ACL as of September 30, 2022 was impacted by several factors, including growth in portfolio loan and lease balances, primarily concentrated in the other consumer loan portfolio, and deterioration in the forecasted macroeconomic conditions in each of the three forecast scenarios. As a result of these factors, the Bancorp incorporated a combination of quantitative model-based estimates and qualitative adjustments. As of September 30, 2022, the Bancorp&#8217;s economic scenarios included estimates of the expected impacts of the changes in economic conditions caused by inflationary and rising interest rate pressures, energy prices and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. The Baseline scenario was assigned a probability weighting of 80%, with the more favorable scenario (Upside) assigned a probability weighting 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

of 10% and the less favorable scenario (Downside) assigned a probability of 10%. The Baseline scenario assumed real GDP growth for 2022 at 1.6%, which is notably lower than the May 2022 scenario, due to the impacts of higher global energy prices, tighter financial market conditions in the U.S. and a 0.9% decrease in real GDP in the second quarter (the second consecutive decline). The Baseline scenario also assumes an average unemployment rate of 3.6% in 2022, increasing to an average of 3.9% in both 2023 and 2024. Lastly, the Baseline scenario assumed continued increases to the target federal funds rate until stabilizing in 2023 and decreasing in 2024. The Upside scenario assumes a faster than anticipated resolution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict with related improvement to economic measures. The Upside scenario also assumes that on an average annual basis, the change in real GDP is 1.9% in 2022 and 4.2% in 2023, with the unemployment rate at an annual average of 3.6% in 2022 and 3.3% in both 2023 and 2024. In the Upside scenario, the forecast for the federal funds rate is consistent with the Baseline scenario but with slightly lower increases resulting from an improving inflation outlook. The Downside scenario includes significant worsening of the Russia-Ukraine conflict resulting in continued increases in oil prices and inflation, causing the U.S. economy to fall into a recession in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Downside scenario assumes that real GDP will decline through the second quarter of 2023, with the change in real GDP at (0.9%) in the fourth quarter of 2022, and an average of (1.9%) in 2023. The Downside scenario unemployment rate peaks at 7.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and decreases to an average of 6.9% in 2024 and 5.7% in 2025. In the Downside scenario, the forecast for the federal funds rate includes higher increases than the Baseline scenario in 2022 and the first half of 2023, followed by rapid decreases through the first half of 2024. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s quantitative credit loss models are sensitive to changes in economic forecast assumptions over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the Downside scenario rather than using the probability-weighted three scenario approach would result in an increase in the quantitative ACL of approximately $2.0 billion. This sensitivity calculation only reflects the impact of changing the probability weighting of the scenarios in the quantitative credit loss models and excludes any additional considerations associated with the qualitative component of the ACL that might be warranted if probability weights were adjusted. 

At September 30, 2022, the ACL attributed to certain segments of commercial real estate included a qualitative component related to the remaining risks associated with supply chain constraints, labor shortages and changes in workplace practices.

The Bancorp&#8217;s ALLL may vary significantly from period to period based on changes in economic conditions, economic forecasts and the composition and credit quality of the Bancorp&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio. For additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for measuring the ACL, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10&#8209;K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

INTEREST RATE AND PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest rates. This risk primarily impacts the Bancorp&#8217;s income categories through changes in interest income on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and through fee items that are related to interest sensitive activities such as mortgage origination and servicing income and through earnings credits earned on commercial deposits that offset commercial deposit fees. Price risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from changes in the value of financial instruments and portfolios due to movements in interest rates, volatilities, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. Management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings. Interest rate risk may occur for any one or more of the following reasons: 

&#8226; Assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times; 

&#8226; Short-term and long-term market interest rates change by different amounts; or 

&#8226; The expected maturities of various assets or liabilities shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. 

In addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on NII and interest-sensitive fees, interest rates can impact earnings through their effect on loan and deposit demand, credit losses, mortgage origination volumes, the value of servicing rights and other sources of the Bancorp&#8217;s earnings. Changes in interest rates and other market factors can impact earnings through changes in the value of portfolios, if not appropriately hedged. Stability of the Bancorp&#8217;s net income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk and to a lesser extent price risk. Management continually reviews the Bancorp&#8217;s on- and off-balance sheet composition, earnings flows, and hedging strategies and models interest rate risk and price risk exposures, and possible actions to manage these risks, given numerous possible future interest rate and market factor scenarios. A series of policy limits and key risk indicators are employed to ensure that risks are managed within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance for interest rate risk and price risk. 

In addition to the traditional forms of interest rate risk discussed in this section, the Bancorp is exposed to interest rate risk associated with the retirement and replacement of LIBOR. For more information on the LIBOR transition, refer to the Overview section of MD&#38;A. 

The Commercial Banking and Wealth and Asset Management lines of business manage price risk for capital markets sales and trading activities related to their respective businesses. The Consumer and Small Business Banking line of business manages price risk for the origination and sale of conforming residential mortgage loans to government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. The Bancorp&#8217;s Treasury department manages interest rate risk and price risk for all other activities. Independent oversight is provided by ERM, and key risk indicators and Board-approved policy limits are used to ensure risks are managed within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Market Risk Management Committee, which includes senior management representatives and reports to the Corporate Credit Committee (accountable to the ERMC), provides oversight and monitors price risk for the capital markets sales and trading activities. The Bancorp&#8217;s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, provides oversight and monitors interest rate and price risks for Mortgage and Treasury activities. 

Net Interest Income Sensitivity 

The Bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an NII simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of NII to changes in interest rates. The model is based on contractual and estimated cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the Bancorp&#8217;s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and attrition rates of certain liabilities. The model also includes senior management&#8217;s projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the Bancorp as well as other pertinent assumptions. The NII simulation model does not represent a forecast of the Bancorp&#8217;s net interest income but is a tool utilized to assess the risk of the impact of changing market interest rates across a range of market interest rate environments. As a result, actual results will differ from simulated results for multiple reasons, which may include actual balance sheet composition differences, timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, deviations from projected customer behavioral assumptions as well as from changes in market conditions and management strategies. 

As of September 30, 2022, the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk exposure is governed by a risk framework that utilizes the change in NII over 12-month and 24-month horizons under parallel ramped increases and decreases in interest rates. Policy limits are utilized for scenarios assuming a 200 bps increase and a 200 bps decrease in interest rates over twelve months. The Bancorp routinely analyzes various potential and extreme scenarios, including parallel ramps and shocks as well as steepening and other non-parallel shifts in rates, including negative rate scenarios, to assess where risks to net interest income persist or develop as changes in the balance sheet and market rates evolve. Additionally, the Bancorp routinely evaluates its exposures to changes in the bases between interest rates. 

In order to recognize the risk of noninterest-bearing demand deposit balance run-off in a rising interest rate environment, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling assumes that approximately $2 billion of additional demand deposit balances run-off over 24 months for each 100 bps increase in short-term market interest rates. Similarly, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling incorporates approximately $2 billion of incremental growth in noninterest-bearing deposit balances over 24 months for each 100 bps decrease in short-term market interest rates. The 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

incremental balance run-off and growth are modeled to flow into and out of funding products that reprice in conjunction with short-term market rate changes. 

Another important deposit modeling assumption is the amount by which interest-bearing deposit rates will increase or decrease when market interest rates increase or decrease. This deposit repricing sensitivity is known as the beta, and it represents the expected amount by which the Bancorp&#8217;s interest-bearing transaction deposit rates will change for a given change in short-term market rates. At December 31, 2021, dynamic deposit beta models were implemented and utilized to adjust assumed pricing sensitivity depending on market rate levels. The dynamic beta models were developed utilizing the Bancorp&#8217;s performance during prior interest rate cycles. During 2022, the Bancorp&#8217;s actual deposit repricing has been slower than what was experienced in prior interest rate cycles, and as a result, the Bancorp has outperformed the NII simulation expectations. Using the dynamic beta models, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling assumes weighted-average rising-rate interest-bearing deposit betas at the end of the ramped parallel scenarios of 60% and 62%, for a 100 bps and 200 bps increase in rates, respectively. In the event of rate cuts, this approach assumes a weighted-average falling-rate interest-bearing deposit beta at the end of the ramped 200 bps decrease in rates of 48% at September 30, 2022, while also maintaining that deposit rates themselves will not become negative. The modeling assumes there is no lag between the timing of changes in market rates and the timing of deposit repricing despite such timing lags having occurred in prior rate cycles. In addition, assumed deposit migration from low-beta deposit products to more rate-sensitive deposit products contribute additional beta of 15%-25% across the rising-rate ramps, resulting in an effective beta of 75-80% in our baseline NII sensitivity profile. Given the year-to-date performance in 2022, the Bancorp may continue to exceed the NII simulation expectations in the event of continued interest rate increases. The Bancorp provides sensitivity analysis in Tables 55 and 56 for key assumptions related to its deposit modeling, including beta and DDA balance performance. 

The Bancorp continually evaluates the sensitivity of its interest rate risk measures to these important deposit modeling assumptions. The Bancorp also regularly monitors the sensitivity of other important modeling assumptions, such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawals on fixed-rate customer liabilities. 

The following table shows the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated NII sensitivity profile and ALCO policy limits as of: 

TABLE 54: Estimated NII Sensitivity Profile and ALCO Policy Limits September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 % Change in NII (FTE) ALCO Policy Limit % Change in NII (FTE) ALCO Policy Limit Change in Interest Rates (bps) 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months +200 Ramp over 12 months (2.36) &#160;% (2.13) (4.00) (6.00) 10.88 22.39 (4.00) (6.00) +100 Ramp over 12 months (1.66) (1.20) N/A N/A 5.67 12.31 N/A N/A

At September 30, 2022, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity is liability sensitive in year one and in year two under the parallel rate ramp increases, due to the previously discussed deposit dynamic beta and balance migration assumptions. The Bancorp&#8217;s NII simulation projects a decrease in both year one and year two under the parallel 200 bps ramp decrease in interest rates. The Bancorp maintains an asymmetric NII sensitivity profile, which is attributable to the level of floating-rate assets, including the predominantly floating-rate commercial loan portfolio, exceeding the level of floating-rate liabilities due to the increased amount of deposits with rates near zero and other fixed-rate borrowings. Reductions in the yield of the commercial loan portfolio would be expected to be only partially offset by a decline in the cost of interest-bearing deposits in certain falling-rate scenarios. However, continued re-positioning into securities with less near-term principal cash flows and the execution of additional receive-fixed hedges have added significant protection from declining rates. The changes in the estimated NII sensitivity profile compared to September 30, 2021 were primarily attributable to significant deployment of cash and other short-term investments into long-term fixed-rate securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the dynamic beta model implementation mentioned previously and higher market interest rates. 

Tables 55 and 56 provide the sensitivity of the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated NII profile at September 30, 2022 to changes to certain deposit balance and deposit repricing sensitivity (betas) assumptions.

The following table includes the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated NII sensitivity profile with an immediate $2 billion decrease and an immediate $2 billion increase in demand deposit balances as of September 30, 2022:

(a) Applies a +/- 10% multiple on assumed betas and includes deposit migration assumptions based on the changes in rates. 

Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity 

The Bancorp also uses EVE as a measurement tool in managing interest rate risk. Whereas the NII sensitivity analysis highlights the impact on forecasted NII on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) over one- and two-year time horizons, EVE is a point-in-time analysis of the economic sensitivity of current positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives. The EVE of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of all asset and net derivative cash flows less the discounted value of all liability cash flows. Due to this longer horizon, the sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk. EVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the balance growth assumptions used in the NII sensitivity analysis. As with the NII simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of existing balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis. Particularly important are assumptions driving loan and security prepayments and the expected balance attrition and pricing of indeterminate-lived deposits. 

The following table shows the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated EVE sensitivity profile as of: 

TABLE 57: Estimated EVE Sensitivity Profile September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Change in Interest Rates (bps) % Change in EVE ALCO Policy Limit % Change in EVE ALCO Policy Limit +200 Shock (7.97) % (12.00) 8.13 (12.00) +100 Shock (3.75) N/A 4.68 N/A -25 Shock N/A N/A (1.48) N/A -200 Shock 0.58 &#160; (12.00) N/A N/A 

The EVE sensitivity is negative in a +200 bps rising-rate scenario and positive in a -200 bps falling-rate scenario at September 30, 2022. The changes in the estimated EVE sensitivity profile from September 30, 2021 were primarily related to significant deployment of cash and other short-term investments into long-term fixed-rate securities and forward-starting receive-fixed hedging transactions executed during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The implementation of dynamic deposit beta models also had a detrimental effect to rising-rate EVE-at-Risk due to current implied long-term rate levels. 

While an instantaneous shift in spot interest rates followed by forward projections is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure, the Bancorp believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (e.g., the current fiscal year). Further, EVE does not account for factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could mitigate or exacerbate the 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

impact of changes in interest rates. The NII simulations and EVE analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage risk in response to actual changes in interest rates. 

The Bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to a static balance sheet forecast, LIBOR, SOFR, Prime Rate and other basis risks, yield curve twist risks and embedded options risks. In addition, the impacts on NII on an FTE basis and EVE of extreme changes in interest rates are modeled, wherein the Bancorp employs the use of yield curve shocks and environment-specific scenarios. 

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk 

An integral component of the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, forward starting interest rate swaps, options, swaptions and TBA securities. 

Tables 58 and 59 show all swap and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing the Bancorp&#8217;s exposures to the variability of interest rates. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index, to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate or to hedge forecasted transactions for the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as the Bancorp adjusts its broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The following tables present additional information about the interest rate swaps and floors used in Fifth Third&#8217;s asset and liability management activities:

Additionally, as part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its residential mortgage banking activities, the Bancorp enters into forward contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically hedge IRLCs that are also considered free-standing derivatives. The Bancorp economically hedges its exposure to residential mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward contracts and mortgage options as well. See the Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Price Risk section for the discussion of the use of derivatives to economically hedge this exposure. 

The Bancorp also enters into derivative contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge market risks assumed in interest rate derivative contracts with commercial customers. Generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the Bancorp from market 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

volatility. Credit risk arises from the possible inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts, which the Bancorp minimizes through collateral arrangements, approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of interest rate volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Price Risk 

The fair value of the residential MSR portfolio was $1.7 billion and $1.1 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of refinancing, the total value of existing servicing rights declines because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans. For further information on the significant drivers and components of the valuation adjustments on MSRs, refer to the Noninterest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of its MSR portfolio as a result of changing interest rates. The Bancorp recognized net losses of $85 million and $370 million on its non-qualifying hedging strategy for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to net losses of $11 million and $101 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. These amounts included net losses of $1 million and $2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to net losses of an immaterial amount and $2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, on securities related to the Bancorp&#8217;s non-qualifying hedging strategy. The Bancorp may adjust its hedging strategy to reflect its assessment of the composition of its MSR portfolio, the cost of hedging and the anticipated effectiveness of the hedges given the economic environment. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on servicing rights and the instruments used to hedge price risk on MSRs. 

Foreign Currency Risk 

The Bancorp may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign denominated loans. The derivatives are classified as free-standing instruments with the revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other noninterest income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of the Bancorp&#8217;s foreign denominated loans at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $961 million and $995 million, respectively. The Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of price risk from interest rate derivative contracts entered into with commercial customers, the Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven foreign exchange activity. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of currency volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts, counterparty credit approvals and country limits performed by independent risk management. 

Commodity Risk 

The Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to commodity price fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of foreign exchange and price risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven commodity activity. The Bancorp may also offset this risk with exchange-traded commodity contracts. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of commodity volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 

The goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals and other contractual obligations. Mitigating liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and investment securities, maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent growth in core deposits. A summary of certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts is included in Note 17 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Treasury department manages funding and liquidity based on point-in-time metrics as well as forward-looking projections, which incorporate different sources and uses of funds under base and stress scenarios. Liquidity risk is monitored and managed by the Treasury department with independent oversight provided by ERM, and a series of Policy Limits and Key Risk Indicators are established to ensure risks are managed within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance. The Bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing, which assesses the liquidity needs under varying market conditions, time horizons, asset growth rates and other events. The contingency plan provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. The contingency plan also outlines the Bancorp&#8217;s response to various levels of liquidity stress and actions that should be taken during various scenarios. 

Liquidity risk is monitored and managed for both Fifth Third Bancorp and its subsidiaries. The Bancorp receives substantially all of its liquidity from dividends from its subsidiaries, primarily Fifth Third Bank, National Association. Subsidiary dividends are supplemented with term debt to enable the Bancorp to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its cash obligations, including debt service and scheduled maturities, common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to subsidiaries and other planned capital actions in the form of share repurchases. Liquidity resources are more limited at the Bancorp, making its liquidity position more susceptible to market disruptions. Bancorp liquidity is assessed using a cash coverage horizon, ensuring the entity maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a period of sustained market disruption while meeting its anticipated obligations over an extended stressed horizon. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, monitors and manages liquidity and funding risk within Board-approved policy limits. In addition to the risk management activities of ALCO, the Bancorp has a liquidity risk management function as part of ERM that provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management. 

Sources of Funds 

The Bancorp&#8217;s primary sources of funds relate to cash flows from loan and lease repayments, payments from securities related to sales and maturities, the sale or securitization of loans and leases and funds generated by core deposits, in addition to the use of public and private debt offerings. 

Of the $51.3 billion o f securities in the Bancorp&#8217;s available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio at September 30, 2022, $4.5 billion in principal and interest is expected to be received in the next 12 months and an additional $4.7 billion is expected to be received in the next 13 to 24 months. For further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s securities portfolio, refer to the Investment Securities subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A. 

Asset-driven liquidity is provided by the Bancorp&#8217;s ability to sell or securitize loans and leases. In order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity, the Bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of interest-sensitive assets. A majority of the long-term, fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to FHLMC or FNMA guidelines are sold for cash upon origination. Additional assets such as certain other residential mortgage loans, certain commercial loans and leases, home equity loans, automobile loans and other consumer loans are also capable of being securitized or sold. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Bancorp sold loans and leases totalin g $4.0 billion and $10.6 billion, res pectively, compared to $4.8 billion and $12.9 billion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. For further information, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Core deposits have historically provided the Bancorp with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. The Bancorp&#8217;s average core deposits and average shareholders&#8217; equity funde d 85% and 88% of its average total assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to 90% for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. In addition to core deposit funding, the Bancorp also accesses a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources, which include the use of the FHLB system. Management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs. 

In June of 2022, the Board of Directors authorized $5.0 billion of debt or other securities for issuance, of which $4.0 billion of debt or other securities were available for issuance a s of September 30, 2022. The Bancorp is authorized to file any necessary registration statements with the SEC to permit ready access to the public securities markets; however, access to these markets may depend on market conditions. The Bancorp issued and sold fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes of $1 billion in April of 2022 and $1 billion in July of 2022 as further discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

As of September 30, 2022, the Bank&#8217;s global bank note program had a borrowing capacit y of $25.0 billion, of which $22.3 billion was available for issuance. Additionally, at September 30, 2022, the Bank had approximately $49.2 billion of borrowing capacity available through secured borrowing sources, including the FRB and FHLB. 

For further information on a subsequent event related to long-term debt, refer to Note 24 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Current Liquidity Position 

The Bancorp maintains a strong liquidity profile driven by strong core deposit funding and over $95 billion in current available liquidity. The Bancorp is managing liquidity prudently in the current environment and maintains a liquidity profile focused on core deposit and stable long-term funding sources, while supplementing with a variety of secured and unsecured wholesale funding sources across the maturity spectrum, which allows for the effective management of concentration and rollover risk. A significant portion of the Bancorp&#8217;s excess cash and other short-term investments have been invested in long-term fixed-rate securities since the start of 2022. The Bancorp&#8217;s investment portfolio remains highly concentrated in liquid and readily marketable instruments and is a significant source of secured borrowing capacity. 

As of September 30, 2022, the Bancorp (parent company) has sufficient liquidity to meet contractual obligations and all preferred and common dividends without accessing the capital markets or receiving upstream dividends from the Bank subsidiary f or 23 months. 

Credit Ratings 

The cost and availability of financing to the Bancorp and Bank are impacted by its credit ratings. A downgrade to the Bancorp&#8217;s or Bank&#8217;s credit ratings could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its borrowing costs, thereby adversely impacting the Bancorp&#8217;s or Bank&#8217;s financial condition and liquidity. Key factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong credit quality, strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources, in addition to disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s credit ratings are summarized in Table 60. The ratings reflect the ratings agency&#8217;s view on the Bancorp&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s capacity to meet financial commitments.* 

* As an investor, you should be aware that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

Management regularly reviews the Bancorp&#8217;s capital levels to help ensure it is appropriately positioned under various operating environments. The Bancorp has established a Capital Committee which is responsible for making capital plan recommendations to management. These recommendations are reviewed by the ERMC and the annual capital plan is approved by the Board of Directors. The Capital Committee is responsible for execution and oversight of the capital actions of the capital plan. 

Regulatory Capital Ratios 

The Basel III Final Rule sets minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as defines the measure of &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; for insured depository institutions. 

TABLE 61: Prescribed Capital Ratios Minimum Well-Capitalized CET1 capital: Fifth Third Bancorp 4.50 &#160;% N/A Fifth Third Bank, National Association

The Bancorp is subject to the stress capital buffer requirement and must maintain capital ratios above its buffered minimum (regulatory minimum plus stress capital buffer) in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The FRB uses the supervisory stress test to determine the Bancorp&#8217;s stress capital buffer, subject to a floor of 2.5%. The Bancorp&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement has been 2.5% since the introduction of this framework and was most recently affirmed as part of the FRB&#8217;s 2022 supervisory stress test with an effective date of October 1, 2022. The Bancorp&#8217;s capital ratios have exceeded the stress capital buffer requirement for all periods presented. 

The Bancorp adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 and elected the five-year transition phase-in option for the impact of CECL on regulatory capital with its regulatory filings as of March 31, 2020. The Bancorp&#8217;s modified CECL transition amount became subject to the phase-out provisions of the final rule on January 1, 2022, and will be fully phased-out by January 1, 2025. The impact of the modified CECL transition amount on the Bancorp&#8217;s regulatory capital at September 30, 2022 was an increase in capital of approximately $373 million. On a fully phased-in basis, the Bancorp&#8217;s CET1 ratio would be reduced by 21 bps as of September 30, 2022. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following table summarizes the Bancorp&#8217;s capital ratios as of:

(b) Excludes AOCI. 

(c) Regulatory capital ratios as of September 30, 2022 are calculated pursuant to the five-year transition provision option to phase in the effects of CECL on regulatory capital. 

Capital Planning 

In 2011, the FRB adopted the capital plan rule, which requires BHCs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans to the FRB for review. Under the rule, these capital plans must include detailed descriptions of the following: the BHC&#8217;s internal processes for assessing capital adequacy; the policies governing capital actions such as common stock issuances, dividends and share repurchases; and all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon. Furthermore, each BHC must report to the FRB the results of stress tests conducted by the BHC under a number of scenarios that assess the sources and uses of capital under baseline and stressed economic conditions. 

Under the Enhanced Prudential Standards tailoring rules, the Bancorp is subject to Category IV standards, under which the Bancorp is no longer required to file semi-annual, company-run stress tests with the FRB and publicly disclose the results. However, the Bancorp is required to develop and maintain a capital plan approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis. As an institution subject to Category IV standards, the Bancorp is subject to the FRB&#8217;s supervisory stress tests every two years, the Board capital plan rule and certain FR Y-14 reporting requirements. The supervisory stress tests are forward-looking quantitative evaluations of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on the Bancorp&#8217;s capital. The Bancorp became subject to Category IV standards on December 31, 2019, and the requirements outlined above apply to the stress test cycle that started on January 1, 2020. The Bancorp was subject to the 2022 supervisory stress test conducted by the FRB and submitted the Board-approved capital plan and information contained in Schedule C - Regulatory Capital Instruments as required. 

Dividend Policy and Stock Repurchase Program 

The Bancorp&#8217;s common stock dividend policy and stock repurchase program reflect its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need to maintain adequate capital levels, the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends and the need to comply with safe and sound banking practices as well as meet regulatory requirements and expectations. The Bancorp declared dividends per common share of $0.33 and $0.30 f or the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $0.93 and $0.84 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
