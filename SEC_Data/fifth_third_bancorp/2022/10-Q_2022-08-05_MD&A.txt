Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 2) 

The following is Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of certain significant factors that have affected Fifth Third Bancorp&#8217;s (the &#8220;Bancorp&#8221; or &#8220;Fifth Third&#8221;) financial condition and results of operations during the periods included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which are a part of this filing. Reference to the Bancorp incorporates the parent holding company and all consolidated subsidiaries. The Bancorp&#8217;s banking subsidiary is referred to as the Bank. 

OVERVIEW 

Fifth Third Bancorp is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. At June 30, 2022, the Bancorp had $207 billion in assets and operated 1,080 full-service banking centers and 2,153 Fifth Third branded ATMs in eleven states throughout the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the U.S. The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Wealth and Asset Management. 

This overview of MD&#38;A highlights selected information in the financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document as well as the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorp&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, refer to the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool for the reader of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD&#38;A, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Net interest income, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD&#38;A on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. The FTE basis for presenting net interest income is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&#38;A. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. For the three months ended June 30, 2022, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 67% and 33% of total revenue, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 65% and 35% of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers domiciled in the U.S. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A, risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the Bancorp. 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio, as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral. 

Noninterest income is derived from service charges on deposits, wealth and asset management revenue, commercial banking revenue, card and processing revenue, leasing business revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, other noninterest income and net securities gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes compensation and benefits, technology and communications, net occupancy expense, equipment expense, leasing business expense, marketing expense, card and processing expense and other noninterest expense. 

COVID-19 Global Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic created significant economic uncertainty and financial disruptions during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Government and public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic caused reductions and instability in economic activity and volatility in the financial markets. This market volatility has persisted as the impacts of the pandemic have continued to evolve. Furthermore, resurgence risk remains as new virus variants are identified. The Bancorp continues to closely monitor the pandemic and its effect on customers, employees, communities and markets. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, low interest rates, reduced economic activity and market volatility had the most immediate negative impacts on the Bancorp&#8217;s performance. The Bancorp is unable to estimate the extent of the impact that these factors have had on its operating results since the pandemic began and these factors may adversely impact its future operating results. 

Current Economic Conditions 

Robust demand, labor shortages and supply chain constraints have led to persistent inflationary pressures throughout the economy. In response to these inflationary pressures, the FRB has raised benchmark interest rates in recent months and may continue to raise interest rates in response to economic conditions, particularly a continued high rate of inflation. Amidst these uncertainties, financial markets have continued to experience volatility. 

Changes in interest rates can affect numerous aspects of the Bancorp&#8217;s business and may impact the Bancorp&#8217;s future performance. If financial markets remain volatile, this may impact the future performance of various segments of the Bancorp&#8217;s business, including the value of the Bancorp&#8217;s investment securities portfolio. The Bancorp continues to closely monitor the pace of inflation and the impacts of inflation on the larger market, including labor and supply chain impacts. 

For further discussion on current economic conditions, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A. Additionally, refer to the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for additional information about the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management activities. 

Senior Notes Offering 

On April 25, 2022, the Bancorp issued and sold $1 billion of fixed-rate/floating-rate senior notes. $400 million of the notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.055% per annum to, but excluding, April 25, 2027, followed by an interest rate of compounded SOFR plus 1.355% until maturity on April 25, 2028. The remaining $600 million of the notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.337% per annum to, but excluding, April 25, 2032, followed by an interest rate of compounded SOFR plus 1.660% until maturity on April 25, 2033. The Bancorp entered into interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to convert the fixed-rate periods of the notes to floating rates of one-month LIBOR plus 1.239% and one-month LIBOR plus 1.543% for the notes due April 25, 2028 and the notes due April 25, 2033, respectively. Each tranche of notes is redeemable in whole at par plus accrued and unpaid interest one year prior to its maturity date, or may be wholly or partially redeemed 30 days or 90 days prior to maturity for the 2028 notes and the 2033 notes, respectively. For further information on a subsequent event related to long-term debt, refer to Note 24. 

Business Combination 

During the second quarter of 2022, the Bancorp completed the acquisition of a national point-of-sale consumer lender specializing in home improvement and solar energy installation loans originated through a network of contractors and installers. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting which generally requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their estimated fair values at acquisition date. These fair value estimates are considered preliminary as of June 30, 2022 and are subject to change for up to one year after the acquisition date as additional information becomes available. For more information on the acquisition, refer to Notes 10 and 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

LIBOR Transition 

In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the &#8220;FCA&#8221;), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. Since then, central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for LIBOR. 

On March 5, 2021, the FCA and ICE Benchmark Administration, Limited announced that the publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR maturities and non-USD LIBOR maturities would cease immediately after December 31, 2021, with the remaining USD LIBOR maturities ceasing immediately after June 30, 2023. In the United States, the Alternative Rates Reference Committee (the &#8220;ARRC&#8221;), a group of market participants convened in 2014 to help ensure a successful transition away from USD LIBOR, identified SOFR as its preferred alternative rate. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. The composition and characteristics of SOFR are not the same as those of LIBOR, and SOFR is fundamentally different from LIBOR for two key reasons: (1) SOFR is a secured rate, while LIBOR is an unsecured rate, and (2) SOFR is an overnight rate, while LIBOR is a forward-looking rate that represents interbank funding over different maturities. As a result, there can be no assurance that SOFR, however calculated, will perform the same way as LIBOR would have at any time, including, as a result of changes in interest and yield rates in the market, market volatility, or global or regional economic, financial, political, regulatory, judicial or other events. 

On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the &#8220;LIBOR Act&#8221;) into law. The LIBOR Act offers a federal solution for transitioning legacy instruments that lack sufficient provisions addressing LIBOR&#8217;s cessation by outlining a uniform process to govern the transition from LIBOR to a replacement rate. The LIBOR Act also establishes a safe harbor for lenders, shielding lenders from litigation as a result of their choice of a replacement rate (such as SOFR) per Federal Reserve Board recommendations. The 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Federal Reserve Board is required to promulgate regulations carrying out the terms of the LIBOR Act not later than 180 days following its enactment. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s LIBOR transition plan is organized around key work streams, including continued engagement with central banks and industry working groups and regulators, active client engagement, comprehensive review of legacy documentation, internal operational and technological readiness, and risk management, among other things, to facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates. 

Although the full impact of LIBOR reforms and actions remains unclear, the Bancorp has discontinued entering into new LIBOR-based contracts in accordance with regulatory guidance, except for permissible limited use as part of hedging and risk management programs. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Bancorp expanded its offering of alternative reference rate products, including SOFR. In addition, the Bancorp is continuing its transition of existing LIBOR-based exposures to an appropriate alternative reference rate on or before June 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2022, the Bancorp had substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products throughout several of its lines of business . These exposures included derivative contracts with a total notional value of approximately $107 billion, loans outstanding of approximately $39 billion, preferred stock of approximately $1.4 billion and long-term debt of approximately $237 million. The Bancorp currently estimates that approximately 14% of the existing exposures will mature before June 30, 2023. F or the contracts that will not mature prior to June 30, 2023, an additional portion of these contracts is subject to contractual terms specifying alternative reference rates (&#8220;fallback provisions&#8221;) that would become effective upon cessation of LIBOR&#8217;s publication. Existing exposures without fallback provisions are expected to be amended prior to June 30, 2023 to include such terms or transition to an alternative reference rate or are expected to transition pursuant to the terms of the LIBOR Act and its related regulations. 

For a further discussion of the various risks the Bancorp faces in connection with the replacement of LIBOR on its operations, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Market Risks&#8212;The replacement of LIBOR could adversely affect Fifth Third&#8217;s revenue or expenses and the value of those assets or obligations.&#8221; in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Key Performance Indicators 

The Bancorp, as a banking institution, utilizes various key indicators of financial condition and operating results in managing and monitoring the performance of the business. In addition to traditional financial metrics, such as revenue and expense trends, the Bancorp monitors other financial measures that assist in evaluating growth trends, capital strength and operational efficiencies. The Bancorp analyzes these key performance indicators against its past performance, its forecasted performance and with the performance of its peer banking institutions. These indicators may change from time to time as the operating environment and businesses change. 

The following are some of the key indicators used by management to assess the Bancorp&#8217;s business performance, including those which are considered in the Bancorp&#8217;s compensation programs: 

&#8226; CET1 Capital Ratio: CET1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets as defined by the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets 

&#8226; Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (non-GAAP): Tangible net income available to common shareholders divided by average tangible common equity 

&#8226; Net Interest Margin (non-GAAP): Net interest income on an FTE basis divided by average interest-earning assets 

&#8226; Efficiency Ratio (non-GAAP): Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income 

&#8226; Earnings Per Share, Diluted: Net income allocated to common shareholders divided by average common shares outstanding after the effect of dilutive stock-based awards 

&#8226; Nonperforming Portfolio Assets Ratio: Nonperforming portfolio assets divided by portfolio loans and leases and OREO 

&#8226; Net Charge-off Ratio: Net losses charged-off divided by average portfolio loans and leases 

&#8226; Return on Average Assets: Net income divided by average assets 

&#8226; Loan-to-Deposit Ratio: Total loans divided by total deposits 

&#8226; Household Growth: Change in the number of consumer households with retail relationship-based checking accounts 

The list of indicators above is intended to summarize some of the most important metrics utilized by management in evaluating the Bancorp&#8217;s performance and does not represent an all-inclusive list of all performance measures that may be considered relevant or important to management or investors.

Earnings Summary 

The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2022 was $526 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, which was net of $36 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2021 was $674 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, which was net of $35 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $1.0 billion, or $1.44 per diluted share, which was net of $56 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was $1.3 billion, or $1.87 per diluted share, which was net of $55 million in preferred stock dividends. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.3 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2022, an increase of $131 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income benefited from increases in market interest rates, average taxable securities, average commercial and industrial loans and average indirect secured consumer loans for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from a decrease in average long-term debt for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. These positive impacts were partially offset by decreases in yields on average taxable securities and i nterest income recognized from PPP loans for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $2.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022, an increase of $150 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income benefited from increases in market interest rates, average taxable securities, average commercial and industrial loans and average indirect secured consumer loans for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from a decrease in average long-term debt for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of reduced interest income recognized from PPP loans for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. Yields on total average loans and leases decreased from the six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily as a result of decreases in yields on average commercial and industrial loans and average indirect secured consumer loans. Additionally, yields on average taxable securities decreased compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.92% and 2.75% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to 2.63% and 2.62% for the comparable periods in the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $179 million and $224 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to a benefit from credit losses of $115 million and $288 million during the same periods in the prior year. The increases in provision expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 were primarily driven by factors that caused increases in the ACL during those periods including higher period-end loan and lease balances, deterioration in forecasted macroeconomic conditions and the initial recognition of

provision expense on loans acquired as part of a business acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2022. Net losses charged off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were 0.21% and 0.16% for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and 0.17% and 0.21% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO were 0.47%. For further discussion on credit quality refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Noninterest income decreased $65 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in mortgage banking net revenue and commercial banking revenue, partially offset by an increase in other noninterest income. 

Noninterest income decreased $131 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in mortgage banking net revenue, commercial banking revenue and leasing business revenue, partially offset by increases in other noninterest income and service charges on deposits. 

Noninterest expense decreased $41 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits, partially offset by increases in marketing expense and technology and communications expense. 

Noninterest expense decreased $35 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in compensation and benefits and card and processing expense, partially offset by increases in technology and communications expense and marketing expense.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The following are non-GAAP financial measures which provide useful insight to the reader of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements but should be supplemental to primary U.S. GAAP measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for the primary U.S. GAAP measures. The Bancorp encourages readers to consider its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income on an FTE basis, interest income on an FTE basis, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio to U.S. GAAP:

The Bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial institutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of return on average tangible common equity to U.S. GAAP:

The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio and tangible common equity ratio, in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. As U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. 

The following table reconciles non-GAAP capital ratios to U.S. GAAP:

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of the significant new accounting standards applicable to the Bancorp and the expected impact of significant accounting standards issued, but not yet required to be adopted. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the Bancorp&#8217;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Bancorp&#8217;s critical accounting policies include the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. There have been no material changes to the valuation techniques or models during the six months ended June 30, 2022.

STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest incurred on core deposits (including transaction deposits and CDs $250,000 or less) and wholesale funding (including CDs over $250,000, other deposits, federal funds purchased, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt). The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Tables 5 and 6 present the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, as well as the relative impact of changes in the average balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses included in average other assets. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.3 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2022, an increase of $131 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income benefited from increases in market interest rates, average taxable securities, average commercial and industrial loans and average indirect secured consumer loans of $17.4 billion, $6.6 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from a decrease in average long-term debt of $2.7 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. These positive impacts were partially offset by a decrease in yields on average taxable securities of 33 bps from the three months ended June 30, 2021 . Interest income recognized from PPP loans decreased to $12 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to $53 million for the same period in the prior year. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $2.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022, an increase of $150 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income benefited from increases in market interest rates, average taxable securities, average commercial and industrial loans and average indirect secured consumer loans of $11.5 billion, $4.8 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from a decrease in average long-term debt of $3.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of reduced interest income recognized from PPP loans of $32 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to $106 million for the same period in the prior year. Yields on total average loans and leases decreased 15 bps from the six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily as a result of decreases in yields on average commercial and industrial loans and average indirect secured consumer loans of 16 bps and 36 bps, respectively. Additionally, yields on average taxable securities decreased 24 bps compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Net interest rate spread on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.76% and 2.61% during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to 2.48% and 2.47% in the same periods in the prior year. Yields on average interest-earning assets increased 31 bps and 10 bps while rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities increased 3 bps and decreased 4 bps for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. 

Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.92% and 2.75% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to 2.63% and 2.62% for the comparable periods in the prior year. Net interest margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was positively impacted by the previously mentioned increases in the net interest rate spread . Net interest margin results are expected to continue increasing as rates rise and assets reprice more than liabilities. 

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from loans and leases increased $46 million and decreased $2 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily driven by the previously mentioned increases in market interest rates, average commercial and industrial loans, and average indirect secured consumer loans, partially offset by lower income from PPP loans. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily driven by lower income from PPP loans, partially offset by the previously mentioned increases in market interest rates, average commercial and industrial loans and average indirect secured consumer loans. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A. Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from investment securities and other short-term investments increased $95 million and $131 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to the previously mentioned increases in average taxable securities as well as increases in yields on other short-term investments, partially offset by decreases in yields on taxable securities. 

Interest expense on core deposits increased $9 million and $3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to increases in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 9 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

bps and 7 bps for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, from 6 bps for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 as a result of increasing short-term interest rates. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s deposits. 

In terest expense on average wholesale funding increased $1 million and decreased $24 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of FHLB advances and an increase in the rates paid on average long-term debt. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2022 included the impact of a decrease in the average balance of long-term debt. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in the average balance of FHLB advances and an increase in the rates paid on average long-term debt. Refer to the Borrowings subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s borrowings. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, average wholesale funding represented 14% and 12%, respectively, of average interest-bearing liabilities, compared to 13% and 14%, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, see the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Bancorp provides, as an expense, an amount for expected credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded commitments and letters of credit that is based on factors previously discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses expected in the portfolios. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the ALLL. The amount of loans and leases actually removed from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and leases. 

The provision for credit losses was $179 million and $224 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to a benefit from credit losses of $115 million and $288 million during the same periods in the prior year. Provision expense increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by factors which caused increases in the ACL during those periods including higher period-end loan and lease balances, deterioration in forecasted macroeconomic conditions and the initial recognition of provision expense on loans acquired as part of a business acquisition during the second quarter of 2022. The benefit from credit losses in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 was driven by decreases in the ACL in response to improved economic forecasts, improved commercial and consumer credit quality and lower period-end loan and lease balances. 

The ALLL increased $122 million from December 31, 2021 to $2.0 billion at June 30, 2022. At June 30, 2022, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases increased to 1.70%, compared to 1.69% at December 31, 2021. The reserve for unfunded commitments increased $6 million from December 31, 2021 to $188 million at June 30, 2022. The ACL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases was 1.85% at both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on the provision for credit losses, including an analysis of loan and lease portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and determining the level of the ACL. 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income decreased $65 million and $131 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. 

The following table presents the components of noninterest income:

Service charges on deposits 

Service charges on deposits consisted of $113 million and $226 million of service charges on commercial deposits and $41 million and $80 million of service charges on consumer deposits for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. Service charges on deposits consisted of $108 million and $214 million of service charges on commercial deposits and $41 million and $78 million of service charges on consumer deposits for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. Service charges on deposits increased $5 million and $14 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to increases in commercial treasury management fees. 

Wealth and asset management revenue 

Wealth and asset management revenue decreased $5 million and increased $1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily driven by decreases in private client service fees. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily driven by 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

increases in private client service fees and broker income. The Bancorp&#8217;s trust and registered investment advisory businesses had approximately $512 billion and $483 billion in total assets under care as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and managed $54 billion and $61 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Commercial banking revenue 

Commercial banking revenue decreased $23 million and $41 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily driven by decreases in corporate bond fees, loan syndication fees and bridge fees, partially offset by increases in contract revenue from commodity derivatives and foreign exchange fees. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was also partially offset by an increase in contract revenue from commercial customer derivatives. 

Card and processing revenue 

Card and processing revenue increased $3 million and $5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to an increase in credit card interchange, partially offset by increased reward costs. The increases in credit card interchange and reward costs were driven by an increase in consumer and business card spend volumes. 

Leasing business revenue 

Leasing business revenue decreased $5 million and $30 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to decreases in leasing business solutions revenue and operating lease income, partially offset by an increase in lease syndication fees. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to decreases in lease syndication fees, leasing business solutions revenue and operating lease income, partially offset by an increase in lease remarketing fees. The decreases in leasing business solutions revenue were related to the disposition of LaSalle Solutions during the second quarter of 2022. 

Mortgage banking net revenue 

Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $33 million and $66 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. 

The following table presents the components of mortgage banking net revenue: 

TABLE 8: Components of Mortgage Banking Net Revenue For the three months ended June 30, For the six months ended June 30, ($ in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Origination fees and gains on loan sales $ 23 &#160; 81 49 &#160; 170 Net mortgage servicing revenue: Gross mortgage servicing fees 81 &#160; 59 149 &#160; 117 Net valuation adjustments on MSRs and free-standing derivatives purchased to economically hedge MSRs

Origination fees and gains on loan sales decreased $58 million and $121 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily driven by decreases in gain on sale margins and lower volume as well as the impact of gains recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 from sales of forbearance loans that were repurchased from GNMA. Residential mortgage loan originations decreased to $4.3 billion and $7.8 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, from $5.0 billion and $9.7 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, due to the impact of higher market interest rates on refinance activity. 

Net mortgage servicing revenue increased $25 million and $55 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to increases in gross mortgage servicing fees and decreases in net negative valuation adjustments. Refer to Table 9 for the components of net valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio and the impact of the non-qualifying hedging strategy.

The Bancorp recognized income of $30 million and $169 million for three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, and losses of $122 million and $50 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, in mortgage banking net revenue for valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio. The valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio included increases of $84 million and $275 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, and a decrease of $49 million and increase of $103 million for the three and six months ended and June 30, 2021, respectively, due to changes in market rates and other inputs in the valuation model, including future prepayment speeds and OAS assumptions. Mortgage rates increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, which resulted in a reduction to modeled prepayment speeds and a widening of the spread between mortgage rates and swap rates. There was also an increase in the modeled OAS assumptions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 . The fair value of the MSR portfolio decreased $54 million and $106 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, and decreased $73 million and $153 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, as a result of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity. 

Further detail on the valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation of the MSR portfolio. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. 

In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp acquires various securities as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. The Bancorp recognized net losses of an immaterial amount and $1 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to net gains of $1 million and net losses of $1 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, recorded in securities (losses) gains, net &#8211; non-qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights in the Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s total residential mortgage loans serviced as of June 30, 2022 and 2021 were $118.2 billion and $93.0 billion, respectively, with $100.5 billion and $71.5 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others. 

Other noninterest income 

The following table presents the components of other noninterest income: 

TABLE 10: Components of Other Noninterest Income For the three months ended June 30, For the six months ended June 30, ($ in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Private equity investment income $ 40 &#160; 20 41 &#160; 19 BOLI income 17 &#160; 15 33 &#160; 31 Cardholder fees 14 &#160; 13 27 &#160; 25 Equity method investment income 5 &#160; 14 13 &#160; 21 Banking center income 7 &#160; 6 12 &#160; 11 Consumer loan fees 5 &#160; 4 9 &#160; 8 Loss on swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc.

Other noninterest income increased $36 million and $46 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to increases in private equity investment income as well as decreases in the loss 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares, partially offset by decreases in equity method investment income and an increase in losses on sale of businesses. 

Private equity investment income increased $20 million and $22 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by gains on certain private equity investments. The Bancorp recognized negative valuation adjustments of $18 million and $29 million related to the Visa total return swap during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to negative valuation adjustments of $37 million and $50 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. For additional information on the valuation of the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares, refer to Note 22 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity method investment income decreased $9 million and $8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the impact of gains recognized on certain equity method investments during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. 

Noninterest Expense 

Noninterest expense decreased $41 million and $35 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.

Compensation and benefits expense decreased $54 million and $48 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in performance-based compensation and non-qualified deferred compensation expense. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was partially offset by the impact of a special broad-based compensation bonus granted in the first quarter of 2022. Full-time equivalent employees totaled 19,119 at June 30, 2022 compared to 19,402 at June 30, 2021. 

Marketing expense increased $8 million and $9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to an increase in account acquisition programs. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was also driven by a brand campaign evolution launch. Technology and communications expense increased $4 million and $12 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increased investment in strategic initiatives and technology. 

Card and processing expense decreased $12 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to contract renegotiations with a third-party vendor.

Other noninterest expense increased $3 million and $9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in travel expense and FDIC insurance and other taxes, partially offset by decreases in loan and lease expense and professional service fees. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2022 also included an increase in losses and adjustments. 

Travel expense increased $10 million and $20 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the gradual cessation of travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. FDIC insurance and other taxes increased $4 million and $7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in the FDIC assessment rate. Losses and adjustments increased $6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a reduction in the net benefit from changes in credit valuation adjustments on customer accommodation derivatives and an increase in operational losses, partially offset by a decrease in legal settlements. 

Loan and lease expense decreased $13 million and $17 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by a decrease in loan servicing expenses related to the Bancorp&#8217;s sales of certain government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans that were previously in forbearance programs and serviced by a third party. Professional service fees decreased $3 million and $6 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to decreases in consulting fees and legal fees. 

Applicable Income Taxes 

The Bancorp&#8217;s income before income taxes, applicable income tax expense and effective tax rate are as follows: 

TABLE 13: Applicable Income Taxes For the three months ended June 30, For the six months ended June 30, ($ in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Income before income taxes $ 724 &#160; 911 1,335 &#160; 1,794 Applicable income tax expense 162 &#160; 202 279 &#160; 391 Effective tax rate 22.4 &#160; &#160;% 22.1 20.9 &#160; 21.8 

Applicable income tax expense for all periods presented includes the benefit from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, and tax credits (and other related tax benefits), partially offset by the effect of proportional amortization of qualifying LIHTC investments and certain nondeductible expenses. The tax credits are primarily associated with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program established under Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC, the Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC and the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program established under Section 1397E of the IRC. 

The effective tax rate was 22.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to 22.1% for the same period in the prior year. The effective tax rate was 20.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to 21.8% for the same period in the prior year primarily related to an increase in excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation.

(a) Includes $371 million and $1.3 billion as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, related to the SBA&#8217;s Paycheck Protection Program. 

Total loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale, increased $4.9 billion, or 4%, from December 31, 2021. The increase from December 31, 2021 was primarily the result of a $4.8 billion, or 7%, increase in commercial loans and leases. 

Commercial loans and leases increased $4.8 billion from December 31, 2021 due to increases in commercial and industrial loans, commercial mortgage loans and commercial construction loans, partially offset by a decrease in commercial leases. Commercial and industrial loans increased $4.4 billion, or 9%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of increased revolving line of credit utilization and stronger production, partially offset by PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns. Commercial mortgage loans increased $419 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2021 as loan originations exceeded payoffs. Commercial construction loans increased $116 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2021 as draws on existing commitments and loan originations exceeded payoffs. Commercial leases decreased $202 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship-based lease originations. 

Consumer loans increased $135 million from December 31, 2021 primarily due to increases in other consumer loans and indirect secured consumer loans, partially offset by decreases in residential mortgage loans and home equity. Other consumer loans increased $769 million, or 28%, from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by loans acquired in a business acquisition during the second quarter of 2022. Indirect secured consumer loans increased $234 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by increased loan production in non-automobile indirect loans, partially offset by indirect automobile payoffs exceeding loan production. Residential mortgage loans decreased $687 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp sold government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs. Home equity decreased $178 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2021 as payoffs exceeded loan originations and new advances.

Average loans and leases, including average loans and leases held for sale, increased $5.8 billion, or 5%, for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of a $5.9 billion, or 9%, increase in average commercial loans and leases. 

Average commercial loans and leases increased $5.9 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by decreases in average commercial construction loans and average commercial leases. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $6.6 billion, or 14%, for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increased revolving line of credit utilization and increased production, partially offset by PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns. Average commercial mortgage loans increased $243 million, or 2%, for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year as loan originations exceeded payoffs. Average commercial construction loans decreased $687 million, or 11%, for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year as payoffs exceeded draws on existing commitments and loan originations. Average commercial leases decreased $334 million, or 11%, for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship-based lease originations. 

Average consumer loans decreased $78 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year due to decreases in average residential mortgage loans, average home equity and average credit card, partially offset by increases in average indirect secured consumer loans and average other consumer loans. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $1.8 billion, or 8%, for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp sold government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs. Average home equity decreased $779 million, or 17%, for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year as payoffs exceeded loan originations. Average credit card decreased $66 million, or 4%, for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in average balances per active account as well as a decrease in the number of active accounts. Average indirect secured consumer loans increased $2.5 billion, or 17%, for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by higher demand and other favorable market conditions from June 30, 2021, which contributed to increased loan production. Average other consumer loans increased $69 million, or 2%, for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by loans acquired in a business acquisition in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by payoffs exceeding loan originations. 

Investment Securities 

The Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing collateral for pledging purposes and for liquidity risk management. Total investment securities were $53.5 billion a nd $39.0 billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The taxable available-for-sale debt and other investment securities portfolio had an effective duration o f 5.7 at June 30, 2022 compared to 4.8 at December 31, 2021. 

Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in management&#8217;s judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. Securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities are classified as trading when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the ne ar term. At June 30, 2022, the B ancorp&#8217;s investment portfolio consisted primarily o f AAA-rated available-for-sale debt and other securities. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The Bancorp held an immaterial amount of below-investment grade available-for-sale debt and other securities at both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

In the first quarter of 2021, the Bancorp recognized $7 million of impairment losses on its available-for-sale debt and other securities, included in securities (losses) gains, net, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. These losses related to certain securities in unrealized loss positions that the Bancorp intended to sell prior to recovery of their amortized cost bases. The Bancorp did not consider these losses to be credit-related. 

At both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Bancorp completed its evaluation of the available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position and did not recognize an allowance for credit losses. The Bancorp did not recognize provision expense related to available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position during both the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of investment securities:

(a) Other securities consist of FHLB, FRB and DTCC restricted stock hold ings that are carried at cost. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities in creased $19.2 billion f rom December 31, 2021 as a result of the deployment of excess short-term investments into longer duration assets in the investment portfolio during the six months ended June 30, 2022. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities wer e 30% and 20% of total interest-earning assets at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities port folio was 7.1 years at June 30, 2022 compared to 6.6 years at December 31, 2021. In addition, at June 30, 2022, the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 2.79% compared to 2.77% at December 31, 2021. 

Information presented in Table 17 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is presented on an FTE basis and is computed using amortized cost balances and reflects the impact of prepayments. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio exclude other securities that have no stated yield or maturity. Total net unrealized losses on the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio were $3.3 billion at June 30, 2022 compared to net unrealized gains of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of the Bancorp&#8217;s investment securities portfolio generally decreases when interest rates increase or when credit spreads widen.

Other Short-Term Investments 

Other short-term investments primarily include overnight interest-earning investments, including reserves held at the FRB and federal funds sold. The Bancorp uses other short-term investments as part of its liquidity risk management tools. Other short-term investments wer e $7.4 billion and $34.6 billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The decrease of $27.2 billion from December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to purchases of investment securities, a decline in core deposit balances, loan growth and decreases in long-term debt during the six months ended June 30, 2022. 

Deposits 

The Bancorp&#8217;s deposit balances represent an important source of funding and revenue growth opportunity. The Bancorp continues to focus on core deposit growth in its retail and commercial franchises by improving customer satisfaction, building full relationships and offering competitive rates. Average core deposits represented 79% of the Bancorp&#8217;s average asset funding base for both the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.

Core deposits decreased $10.0 billion, or 6%, from December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in interest checking deposits, demand deposits, money market deposits and CDs $250,000 or less, partially offset by an increase in savings deposits. Interest checking deposits decreased $5.5 billion, or 11% from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of lower balances per customer account, partially offset by balance migration from demand deposits. Demand deposits decreased $4.2 billion, or 6%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of lower balances per commercial customer account and balance migration into interest checking deposits, partially offset by consumer balance growth. Money market deposits decreased $1.5 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of lower balances per commercial customer account. CDs $250,000 or less decreased $361 million, or 15%, from December 31, 2021 primarily due to lower offering rates. Savings deposits increased $1.5 billion, or 7%, from December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of consumer balance growth. 

CDs over $250,000 increased $1.9 billion from December 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in retail brokered certificates of deposit issued.

(a) Includes retail brokered certificates of deposit. 

On an average basis, core deposits decreased $65 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in average money market deposits, average CDs $250,000 or less and average interest checking deposits, partially offset by increases in average savings deposits and average demand deposits. Average money market deposits decreased $1.6 billion, or 5%, for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of lower average balances per commercial customer account, partially offset by higher average balances per consumer customer account. Average CDs $250,000 or less decreased $1.3 billion, or 38%, for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower offering rates. Average interest checking deposits decreased $958 million, or 2%, for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of lower average balances per commercial customer account, partially offset by balance migration from demand deposits and consumer balance growth. Average savings deposits increased $3.2 billion, or 16%, for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of higher average balances per customer account. Average demand deposits increased $561 million, or 1%, for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of higher average balances per consumer customer account, partially offset by lower average balances per commercial customer account and the aforementioned balance migration into interest checking deposits. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Average CDs over $250,000 increased $336 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in retail brokered certificates of deposit issued. 

Contractual maturities 

The contractual maturities of CDs as of June 30, 2022 are summarized in the following table:

(a) Includes CDs $250,000 or less and CDs over $250,000. 

Deposit insurance 

The FDIC generally provides a standard amount of insurance of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category defined by the FDIC. Depositors may qualify for coverage of accounts over $250,000 if they have funds in different ownership categories and all FDIC requirements are met. All deposits that an account holder has in the same ownership category at the same bank are added together and insured up to the standard insurance amount. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, approximately $67.1 billion and $80.2 billion, respectively, of the Bancorp&#8217;s domestic deposits were uninsured. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, approximately $414 million and $468 million, respectively, of the Bancorp &#8217; s time deposits were not fully insured. The estimated uninsured portions of those time deposits were $195 million and $236 million at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Where information is not readily available to determine the amount of insured deposits, the amount of uninsured deposits is estimated, consistent with the methodologies and assumptions utilized in providing information to the Bank&#8217;s regulators. 

Borrowings 

The Bancorp accesses a variety of short-term and long-term funding sources. Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term and include federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. Total average borrowings as a percent of average interest-bearing liabilities we re 13% for both the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of borrowings: 

TABLE 21: Components of Borrowings As of ($ in millions) June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Federal funds purchased $ 711 &#160; 281 Other short-term borrowings 7,057 &#160; 980 Long-term debt 10,990 &#160; 11,821 Total borrowings $ 18,758 &#160; 13,082 

Total borr owings increased $5.7 billion, or 43%, fro m December 31, 2021 primarily due to increases in other short-term borrowings and federal funds purchased, partially offset by a decrease in long-term debt. Other short-term borrowings and federal funds purchased increased $6.1 billion and $430 million, respectively, from December 31, 2021 primarily due to increased funding needs resulting from an increase in investment securities and loan growth and a decline in core deposit balances. T he level of other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and the sources that are used to satisfy those needs. For further information on the components of other short-term borrowings, ref er to Note 15 of th e Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-term d ebt decreased $831 million f rom December 31, 2021 primarily driven by the early redemptions under the par call options of $1.5 billion of notes, $263 million of fair value adjustments associated with interest rate swaps hedging long-term debt and $101 million of paydo wns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations during the six months ended June 30, 2022. These decreases were partially offset by the issuance of $1 billion of senior fixed-rate/floating-rate notes in April of 2022 . For further information on a subsequent event related to long-term debt, refer to Note 24 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Total average borrowin gs decreased $199 million, or 1%, for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in average long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in average other short-term borrowings. Average long-term deb t decreased $2.7 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same peri od in the prior year primarily driven by the early redemptions under the par call options of $2.4 billion of notes, $301 million of fair value adjustments associated with interest rate swaps hedging long-term debt and $231 million of paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations since June 30, 2021. Additionally, average long-term debt for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was impacted by early redemptions under the par call options of $2.3 billion of notes in June of 2021. The decrease in average long-term debt was partially offset by the issuances of senior fixed-rate/floating-rate notes of $500 million and $1.0 billion in November of 2021 and April of 2022, respectively. Average other short-term borrowings increased $2.5 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased funding needs resulting from an increase in investment securities and loan growth and a decline in core deposit balances. Information on the average rates paid on borrowings is discussed in the Net Interest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A. In addition, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for a discussion on the role of borrowings in the Bancorp&#8217;s liquidity management.

BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW 

The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Wealth and Asset Management. Additional information on each business segment is included in Note 23 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management&#8217;s accounting practices and businesses change. 

The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp&#8217;s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third&#8217;s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing. 

The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. In general, the charge rates on assets decreased throughout 2021, but have increased since December 31, 2021 as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. The credit rates for deposit products also increased since December 31, 2021, due to higher interest rates and modified assumptions. Thus, net interest income for asset-generating business segments was negatively impacted by the rates charged on assets while deposit-providing business segments were positively impacted during the six months ended June 30, 2022. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for allocating provision for credit losses to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. Provision for credit losses attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of relationship depth opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit. 

The following table summarizes net income (loss) by business segment:

Refer to the Applicable Income Taxes subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information. 

Net income was $294 million and $620 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $393 million and $704 million for the same periods in the prior year. The decreases for both periods were primarily driven by increases in provision for credit losses, decreases in noninterest income and increases in noninterest expense, partially offset by increases in net interest income on an FTE basis. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis increased $140 million and $265 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in FTP credit rates on demand deposits and interest checking deposits as well as increases in average balances of and yields on commercial and industrial loans . These positive impacts were partially offset by increases in FTP charges on loans and leases. 

The provision for credit losses was $85 million and $56 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to a benefit from credit losses of $151 million and $227 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. The increases for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in the prior year were primarily driven by the impact of the benefit of lower commercial criticized asset levels for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was also driven by an increase in net charge-offs on commercial loans and leases compared to the same period in the prior year . Annualized net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases increased to 18 bps and 11 bps for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to 4 bps and 10 bps for the same periods in the prior year. 

Noninterest income decreased $10 million and $42 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in commercial banking revenue and leasing business revenue, partially offset by increases in other noninterest income. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was also partially offset by an increase in service

charges on deposits. Commercial banking revenue decreased $20 million and $38 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior yea r primarily due to decreases in corporate bond fees and loan syndication fees . Leasing business revenue decreased $5 million and $30 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to decreases in leasing business solutions revenue and operating lease income, partially offset by an increase in lease syndication fees. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to decreases in lease syndication fees, leasing business solutions revenue and operating lease income, partially offset by an increase in lease remarketing fees. The decreases in leasing business solutions revenue were related to the disposition of LaSalle Solutions during the second quarter of 2022. Other noninterest income increased $15 million and $19 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in private equity investment income. Service charges on deposits increased $7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in commercial treasury management fees. 

Noninterest expense increased $19 million and $47 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in other noninterest expense and compensation and benefits. Other noninterest expense increased $15 million and $34 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in travel expense and allocated expenses related to information technology support services and cash management services. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was also driven by an increase in losses and adjustments. Compensation and benefits increased $6 million and $18 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by higher merit payout, retention efforts and expansion initiatives during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. 

Average commercial loans and leases increased $9.3 billion and $7.6 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in average commercial and industrial loans partially offset by decreases in average commercial construction loans. Average commercial and industrial loans increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increased revolving line of credit utilization and increased production, partially offset by paydowns. Average commercial construction loans decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in the prior year as payoffs exceeded draws on existing commitments and loan originations. 

Average deposits decreased $4.8 billion and $796 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to decreases in average savings and money market deposits and average interest checking deposits. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was partially offset by an increase in average demand deposits. Average savings and money market deposits decreased $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of lower average balances per commercial customer account. Average interest checking deposits decreased $2.3 billion and $528 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of lower average balances per commercial customer account. Average demand deposits increased $1.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of higher average balances per commercial customer account as well as growth in the number of accounts.

Net income was $233 million and $333 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $40 million and $16 million for the same periods in the prior year. The increases were primarily driven by increases in net interest income as well as decreases in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by increases in noninterest expense. Noninterest income decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2022 but increased for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in the prior year. 

Net interest income increased $253 million and $376 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in FTP credits on deposits. This positive impact was partially offset by increases in FTP charge rates on loans and leases and decreases in yields on consumer loans. 

Provision for credit losses decreased $5 million and $27 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to decreases in net charge-offs on credit card and commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by the impact of the benefit of lower commercial criticized asset levels for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. Annualized net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 68 bps and 66 bps for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to 102 bps and 106 bps for the same periods in the prior year. 

Noninterest income decreased $5 million and increased $5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily driven by a decrease in other noninterest income, partially offset by an increase in service charges on deposits. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily driven by an increase in service charges on deposits, partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest income. Service charges on deposits increased $5 million and $8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in both commercial treasury management fees and consumer deposit fees.

The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was also driven by an increase in compensation and benefits, partially offset by a decrease in card and processing expense. Other noninterest expense increased $7 million and $15 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in allocated expenses related to information technology support services, marketing expense and FDIC insurance and other taxes. Compensation and benefits increased $6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase in incentive compensation, partially offset by a decrease in deferred compensation expense. Card and processing expense decreased $13 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by contract renegotiations with a third-party vendor. 

Average consumer loans increased $450 million and $141 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average residential mortgage loans as a result of increases in production. These increases were partially offset by decreases in average home equity as payoffs exceeded loan originations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year . Average commercial loans increased $170 million and $26 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average commercial and industrial loans partially offset by decreases in average commercial mortgage loans. 

Average deposits increased $2.9 billion and $4.3 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average savings and money market deposits and average demand deposits, partially offset by decreases in average certificates of deposit. A verage savings and money market deposits increased $2.6 billion and $3.1 billion and a verage demand deposits increased $1.1 billion and $1.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of higher balances per customer account and decreased consumer outflows, as well as growth in the number of accounts. A verage CDs decreased $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to lower offering rates on certificates.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Consumer Lending incurred a net loss of $2 million and net income of $25 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to net income of $33 million and $65 million for the same periods in the prior year. The decreases for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in the prior year were primarily driven by decreases in noninterest income and net interest income, partially offset by decreases in noninterest expense. 

Net interest income decreased $28 million and $23 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in average balances of residential mortgage loans as well as decreases in yields on indirect secured consumer loans and residential mortgage loans. These decreases were partially offset by increases in average balances of indirect secured consumer loans. 

Provision for credit losses increased $4 million and $2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in net charge-offs on indirect secured consumer loans. Annualized net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were 5 bps and 7 bps for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to an immaterial amount and 7 bps for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. 

Noninterest income decreased $30 million and $61 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in mortgage banking net revenue. Refer to the Noninterest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the fluctuations in mortgage banking net revenue. 

Noninterest expense decreased $17 million and $35 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to decreases in other noninterest expense. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was also due to a decrease in compensation and benefits. Other noninterest expense decreased $16 million and $24 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in loan and lease expense, losses and adjustments and corporate overhead allocations. Compensation and benefits decreased $11 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in incentive compensation and base compensation resulting from the decreased mortgage origination activity for the six months ended June 30, 2022. 

Average consumer loans decreased $642 million and increased $538 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to decreases in average residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp sold government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs. Average indirect secured consumer loans increased $2.6 billion and $2.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by higher demand and other favorable market conditions from June 30, 2021 , which contributed to increased loan production. Average other consumer loans increased $291 million and $146 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by loans acquired in a business acquisition in the second quarter of 2022.

TABLE 27: Wealth and Asset Management For the three months ended June 30, For the six months ended June 30, ($ in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Income Statement Data Net interest income $ 53 &#160; 21 88 &#160; 42 Benefit from credit losses &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#160; (1) Noninterest income: Wealth and asset management revenue 132 &#160; 138 274 &#160; 274 Other noninterest income &#8212; &#160; 5 2 &#160; 7 Noninterest expense: Compensation and benefits 56 &#160; 49 116 &#160; 103 Other noninterest expense 81 &#160; 82 164 &#160; 164 Income before income taxes $ 48 &#160; 33 84 &#160; 57 Applicable income tax expense 10 &#160; 7 18 &#160; 12 Net income $ 38 &#160; 26 66 &#160; 45 Average Balance Sheet Data Loans and leases, including held for sale $ 4,490 &#160; 3,772 4,317 &#160; 3,759 Deposits 12,948 &#160; 11,188 13,408 &#160; 11,455 

Net income was $38 million and $66 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $26 million and $45 million for the same periods in the prior year. The increases were primarily driven by increases in net interest income, partially offset by increases in noninterest expense and decreases in noninterest income. 

Net interest income increased $32 million and $46 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in FTP credits on deposits as well as increases in average balances and yields on commercial and industrial loans. These positive impacts were partially offset by increases in FTP charges on loans and leases and rates paid on average interest checking deposits for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in the prior year. 

Noninterest income decreased $11 million and $5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in other noninterest income. The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was also due to a decrease in wealth and asset management revenue. Other noninterest income decreased $5 million for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by a loss on the sale of a business. Wealth and asset management revenue decreased $6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in private client service fees, partially offset by an increase in institutional fees. 

Noninterest expense increased $6 million and $13 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits increased $7 million and $13 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of increases in incentive compensation and base compensation. 

Average loans and leases increased $718 million and $558 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average commercial and industrial loans as a result of higher loan production. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Average deposits increased $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average interest checking deposits, average savings and money market deposits and average demand deposits as a result of higher average balances per customer account. 

General Corporate and Other 

General Corporate and Other includes the unallocated portion of the investment securities portfolio, securities gains and losses, certain non-core deposit funding, unassigned equity, unallocated provision for credit losses expense or a benefit from the reduction of the ACL, the payment of preferred stock dividends and certain support activities and other items not attributed to the business segments. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis decreased $266 million and $515 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in FTP credits on deposits allocated to the business segments as well as increases in interest expense on other short-term borrowings. These negative impacts were partially offset by increases in the benefit related to FTP charge rates on loans and leases allocated to the business segments and increases in interest income on investment securities as well as decreases in interest expense on long-term debt. 

The provision for credit losses was $70 million and $119 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to provision for credit losses of $11 million and a benefit from credit losses of $134 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. The increases in provision expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in the prior year were primarily driven by factors affecting the ACL including higher end-of-period commercial and consumer loan balances as well as deterioration in forecasted macroeconomic conditions. These increases were partially offset by the impact of allocations to the business segments. 

Noninterest income decreased $11 million and $29 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in net securities losses, partially offset by decreases in the losses recognized on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares. 

Noninterest expense decreased $59 million and $67 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in compensation and benefits due to decreases in benefits expense, incentive compensation and deferred compensation. The decreases also included the impact of increases in corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments, partially offset by increases in technology and communications expense and travel expense.

RISK MANAGEMENT - OVERVIEW 

The Risk Management Overview section included in Item 7 of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K describes the Bancorp&#8217;s Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Three Lines of Defense structure as well as key areas of risk, which include credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, price risk, legal and regulatory compliance risk, operational risk, reputation risk and strategic risk. Item 7 of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K also includes additional detailed information about the Bancorp&#8217;s processes related to operational risk management as well as legal and regulatory compliance risk management. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT 

The objective of the Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the Bancorp. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. The Bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices which are described below. These practices include the use of intentional risk-based limits for single name exposures and counterparty selection criteria designed to reduce or eliminate exposure to borrowers who have higher than average default risk and defined weaknesses in financial performance. The Bancorp carefully designs and monitors underwriting, documentation and collection standards. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Credit officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority amounts, the utilization of which is closely monitored. Underwriting activities are centrally managed, and Credit Risk Management manages the policy and the authority delegation process directly. The Credit Risk Review function provides independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk grades and the charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the ACL is based on quarterly assessments of the estimated losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp uses these assessments to promptly identify potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio, maintain an adequate ACL and record any necessary charge-offs. The Bancorp defines potential problem loans and leases as those rated substandard that do not meet the definition of a nonaccrual loan or a restructured loan. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s credit grade categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions. In addition, stress testing is performed on various commercial and consumer portfolios utilizing various models. For certain portfolios, such as real estate and leveraged lending, stress testing is performed by Credit department personnel at the individual loan level during credit underwriting. 

The following tables provide a summary of potential problem portfolio loans and leases: 

TABLE 28: Potential Problem Portfolio Loans and Leases As of June 30, 2022 ($ in millions) Carrying Value Unpaid Principal Balance Exposure Commercial and industrial loans $ 1,685 &#160; 1,687 &#160; 2,805 &#160; Commercial mortgage loans 698 &#160; 701 &#160; 713 &#160; Commercial construction loans 287 &#160; 287 &#160; 316 &#160; Commercial leases 58 &#160; 58 &#160; 58 &#160; Total potential problem portfolio loans and leases $ 2,728 &#160; 2,733 &#160; 3,892 &#160; TABLE 29: Potential Problem Portfolio Loans and Leases As of December 31, 2021 ($ in millions) Carrying Value Unpaid Principal Balance Exposure Commercial and industrial loans $ 1,587 1,589 2,842 Commercial mortgage loans 783 787 791 Commercial construction loans 339 339 357 Commercial leases 59 59 60 Total potential problem portfolio loans and leases $ 2,768 2,774 4,050 

In addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems. The first of these risk grading systems encompasses ten categories, which are based on regulatory guidance for credit risk systems. These ratings are used by the Bancorp to monitor and manage its credit risk. The Bancorp also maintains a dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing, portfolio monitoring and capital allocation that includes a &#8220;through-the-cycle&#8221; rating philosophy for assessing a borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness. A &#8220;through-the-cycle&#8221; rating philosophy uses a grading scale that assigns ratings based on average default rates through an entire business cycle for borrowers with similar financial performance. The dual risk rating system includes thirteen probabilities of default grade categories and an additional eleven grade categories for estimating 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

losses given an event of default. The probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the ten-category regulatory risk rating system. 

The Bancorp utilizes internally developed models to estimate expected credit losses for portfolio loans and leases. For loans and leases that are collectively evaluated, the Bancorp utilizes these models to forecast expected credit losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for additional information about the Bancorp&#8217;s processes for developing these models, estimating credit losses for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period and for estimating credit losses for individually evaluated loans. 

For the commercial portfolio segment, the estimated probabilities of default are primarily based on the probability of default ratings assigned under the through-the-cycle dual risk rating system and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. 

For collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower&#8217;s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The Bancorp also utilizes various scoring systems, analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring processes to assess the credit risk of the consumer and residential mortgage portfolios. 

Overview 

The first half of 2022 was defined by heightened volatility in financial markets as the FRB indicated monetary policy would expeditiously return to a neutral policy setting and most likely move to a restrictive setting later in 2022. Persistent inflation and Federal Reserve rate hikes weighed on financial market returns in the first half of 2022, as the S&#38;P 500 declined 20% and the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index fell 10.3%. Commodities prices which had increased from the war in Ukraine earlier in the year came under pressure in June 2022 as fears of an economic recession increased. 

Monetary policy makers are attempting to slow consumer and business demand for goods and services. The persistence of inflation has led the FOMC to raise rates at the most aggressive pace since the 1980s. FRB officials have indicated that they are more concerned about the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched than the risk of pushing the economy into a recession. 

Consumer and business sentiment surveys softened throughout the first half of 2022 as the outlook for growth deteriorated due to higher inflation and geopolitical risks. The dramatic increase in household wealth since March 2020 has supported consumer demand thus far, however higher inflation is leading consumers to pull back on discretionary items as spending on essentials consumes more of their income. With consumer demand beginning to slow, businesses are facing a more challenging environment as profit margins come under pressure from higher inflation and decreasing demand for their products and services. 

Commercial Portfolio 

The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy seeks to minimize concentrations of risk through diversification. The Bancorp has commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of business within the commercial segment, geography and credit product type. The risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and continuous portfolio risk management reporting. 

The Bancorp is closely monitoring various economic conditions and their impacts on commercial borrowers, including the pace of inflation, rising interest rates, labor and supply chain issues, and changes in consumer discretionary spending patterns, among others. The Bancorp maintains focus on disciplined client selection, adherence to underwriting policy and attention to borrower and industry concentrations. 

The Bancorp provides loans to a variety of customers ranging from large multinational firms to middle market businesses, sole proprietors and high net worth individuals. The origination policies for commercial and industrial loans outline the risks and underwriting requirements for loans to businesses in various industries. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, collateral and leverage

requirements, cash flow coverage measures and hold limits. The Bancorp aligns credit and sales teams with specific industry expertise to better monitor and manage different industry segments of the portfolio. 

The following table provides detail on commercial loans and leases by industry classification (as defined by the North American Industry Classification System), by loan size and by state, illustrating the diversity and granularity of the Bancorp&#8217;s commercial loans and leases as of:

The origination policies for commercial real estate outline the risks and underwriting requirements for owner and nonowner-occupied and construction lending. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, maximum LTVs, minimum debt service coverage ratios, construction loan monitoring procedures, appraisal requirements, pre-leasing requirements (as applicable), pro forma analysis requirements and interest rate sensitivity. The Bancorp requires a valuation of real estate collateral, which may include third-party appraisals, be performed at the time of origination and renewal in accordance with regulatory requirements and on an as-needed basis when market conditions justify. Although the Bancorp does not back test these collateral value assumptions, the Bancorp maintains an appraisal review department to order and review third-party appraisals in accordance with regulatory requirements. Collateral values on criticized assets with relationships exceeding $1 million are reviewed quarterly to assess the appropriateness of the value ascribed in the assessment of charge-offs and specific reserves. 

The Bancorp assesses all real estate and non-real estate collateral securing a loan and considers all cross-collateralized loans in the calculation of the LTV ratio. The following tables provide detail on the most recent LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans greater than $1 million, excluding commercial mortgage loans that are individually evaluated. The Bancorp does not typically aggregate the LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans less than $1 million.

Consumer Portfolio 

Consumer credit risk management utilizes a framework that encompasses consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting credit risk. These processes are supported by a credit risk governance structure that includes Board oversight, policies, risk limits and risk committees. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s consumer portfolio is materially comprised of five categories of loans: residential mortgage loans, home equity, indirect secured consumer loans, credit card and other consumer loans. The Bancorp has identified certain credit characteristics within these five categories of loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio. The Bancorp does not update LTVs for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except as part of the charge-off process for real estate secured loans. The Bancorp actively manages the consumer portfolio through concentration limits, which mitigate credit risk through limiting the exposure to lower FICO scores, higher LTVs and specific geographic concentration risks. 

The Bancorp continues to ensure that underwriting standards and guidelines adequately account for the broader economic conditions that the consumer portfolio faces in a rising rate environment. Guidelines are designed to ensure that the various consumer products fall within the Bancorp &#8217; s risk appetite. These guidelines will be monitored and adjusted as deemed appropriate in response to the prevailing economic conditions while remaining within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance limits. 

The payment structures for certain variable rate products (such as residential mortgage loans, home equity and credit card) are susceptible to changes in benchmark interest rates. With continued increases in interest rates, minimum payments on these products also increase, raising the potential for the environment to be disruptive to some borrowers. The Bancorp actively monitors the portion of its consumer portfolio that is susceptible to increases in minimum payments and continues to assess the impact on the overall risk appetite and soundness of the portfolio. 

Residential mortgage portfolio 

The Bancorp manages credit risk in the residential mortgage portfolio through underwriting guidelines that limit exposure to higher LTVs and lower FICO scores. Additionally, the portfolio is governed by concentration limits that ensure geographic, product and channel diversification. The Bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio. 

The Bancorp does not originate residential mortgage loans that permit customers to defer principal payments or make payments that are less than the accruing interest. The Bancorp originates both fixed-rate and ARM loans. Within the ARM portfolio, approximately $486 million of ARM loans will have rate resets during the next twelve months. Of these resets, substantially all are expected to experience an increase in rate, with an average increase of approximately 1.94%. Underlying characteristics of these borrowers are relatively strong with a weighted average origination DTI of 35% and weighted average origination LTV of 73%. 

Certain residential mortgage products have characteristics that may increase the Bancorp &#8217; s credit loss rates in the event of a decline in housing values. These types of mortgage products offered by the Bancorp include loans with high LTVs, multiple loans secured by the same collateral that when combined result in an LTV greater than 80% and interest-only loans. The Bancorp has deemed residential mortgage loans with greater than 80% LTVs and no mortgage insurance as loans that represent a higher level of risk.

Home equity portfolio 

The Bancorp&#8217;s home equity portfolio is primarily comprised of home equity lines of credit. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, the Bancorp&#8217;s newly originated home equity lines of credit have a 10-year interest-only draw period followed by a 20-year amortization period. The home equity line of credit previously offered by the Bancorp was a revolving facility with a 20-year term, minimum payments of interest-only and a balloon payment of principal at maturity. Approximately 44% of the outstanding balances of the Bancorp&#8217;s portfolio of home equity lines of credit have a balloon structure at maturity. Peak maturity years for the balloon home equity lines of credit are 2025 to 2028 and approximately 18% of the balances mature before 2025. 

The ALLL provides coverage for expected losses in the home equity portfolio. The allowance attributable to the portion of the home equity portfolio that has not been restructured in a TDR is determined on a pooled basis using a probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default model framework to generate expected losses. The expected losses for the home equity portfolio are dependent upon loan 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

delinquency, FICO scores, LTV, loan age and their historical correlation with macroeconomic variables including unemployment and the home price index. The expected losses generated from models are adjusted by certain qualitative adjustment factors to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends. The qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. 

The home equity portfolio is managed in two primary groups: loans outstanding with a combined LTV greater than 80% and those loans with an LTV of 80% or less based upon appraisals at origination. For additional information on these loans, refer to Table 39 and Table 40. Of the total $3.9 billion of outstanding home equity loans: 

&#8226; 80% reside within the Bancorp&#8217;s Midwest footprint of Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky as of June 30, 2022; 

&#8226; 42% are in senior lien positions and 58% are in junior lien positions at June 30, 2022; 

&#8226; 79% of non-delinquent borrowers made at least one payment greater than the minimum payment during the three months ended June 30, 2022; and 

&#8226; The portfolio had a weighted average refreshed FICO score of 751 at June 30, 2022. 

The Bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes adjustments in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Bancorp does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTVs after origination. However, the Bancorp monitors the local housing markets by reviewing various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring processes. For junior lien home equity loans which become 60 days or more past due, the Bancorp tracks the performance of the senior lien loans in which the Bancorp is the servicer and utilizes consumer credit bureau attributes to monitor the status of the senior lien loans that the Bancorp does not service. If the senior lien loan is found to be 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status unless both loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, if the junior lien home equity loan becomes 120 days or more past due and the senior lien loan is also 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is assessed for charge-off.

Other consumer portfolio loans 

Other consumer portfolio loans are comprised of secured and unsecured loans originated through the Bancorp&#8217;s branch network, home improvement and solar energy installation loans originated through a network of contractors and installers, and point-of-sale loans originated or purchased in connection with third-party companies. The Bancorp had $212 million in unfunded commitments associated with loans originated in connection with third-party companies as of June 30, 2022. The Bancorp closely monitors the credit performance of point-of-sale loans. Loans originated in connection with one third-party company are impacted by certain credit loss protection coverage provided by that company. In the event that the origination agreement with this third-party company is terminated, loans with an outstanding balance of $1.2 billion at June 30, 2022 would become subject to a 90-day call option that gives the third-party company the right, but not the obligation, to purchase loans from the Bancorp at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest less service fees.

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal and/or interest is uncertain; restructured commercial, credit card and consumer loans which do not meet the requirements to be classified as a performing asset; and certain other assets, including OREO and other repossessed property. A summary of nonperforming assets is included in Table 47. For further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s policies related to accounting for delinquent and nonperforming loans and leases, refer to the Nonaccrual Loans and Leases section of Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Nonperforming assets were $559 million at June 30, 2022 compared to $542 million at December 31, 2021. At June 30, 2022, an immaterial amount of nonaccrual loans were held for sale, compared to $15 million at December 31, 2021. 

Nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO were 0.47% at both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Nonaccrual loans and leases secured by real estate were 40% of nonaccrual loans and leases as of June 30, 2022 compared to 33% as of December 31, 2021. 

Portfolio commercial nonaccrual loans and leases were $319 million at June 30, 2022, a decrease of $18 million from December 31, 2021. Portfolio consumer nonaccrual loans were $220 million at June 30, 2022, an increase of $59 million from December 31, 2021. Refer to Table 48 for a rollforward of the portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases. 

OREO and other repossessed property was $20 million and $29 million at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The Bancorp recognized an immaterial amount of losses on the transfer, sale or write-down of OREO properties for both the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. The Bancorp recognized $1 million in gains and $6 million in losses on the transfer, sale or write-down of OREO properties for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, approximately $9 million and $15 million, respectively, of interest income would have been recognized if the nonaccrual and renegotiated loans and leases on nonaccrual status had been current in accordance with their contractual terms compared to $8 million and $18 million in the same periods in the prior year. Although these values help demonstrate the costs of carrying nonaccrual credits, the Bancorp does not expect to recover the full amount of interest as nonaccrual loans and leases are generally carried below their principal balance.
