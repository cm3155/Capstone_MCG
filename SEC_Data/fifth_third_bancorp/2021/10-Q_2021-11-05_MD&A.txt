Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 2) 

The following is Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of certain significant factors that have affected Fifth Third Bancorp&#8217;s (the &#8220;Bancorp&#8221; or &#8220;Fifth Third&#8221;) financial condition and results of operations during the periods included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which are a part of this filing. Reference to the Bancorp incorporates the parent holding company and all consolidated subsidiaries. The Bancorp&#8217;s banking subsidiary is referred to as the Bank. 

OVERVIEW 

Fifth Third Bancorp is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. At September 30, 2021, the Bancorp had $208 billion in assets and operated 1,100 full-service banking centers and 2,336 Fifth Third branded ATMs in eleven states throughout the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the U.S. The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Wealth and Asset Management. 

This overview of MD&#38;A highlights selected information in the financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document as well as the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorp&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, refer to the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool for the reader of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD&#38;A, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Net interest income, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD&#38;A on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. The FTE basis for presenting net interest income is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&#38;A. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. For the three months ended September 30, 2021, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 59% and 41% of total revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 61% and 39% of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers domiciled in the U.S. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A, risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the Bancorp. 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio, as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral. 

Noninterest income is derived from commercial banking revenue, service charges on deposits, wealth and asset management revenue, card and processing revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, leasing business revenue, other noninterest income and net securities gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes compensation and benefits, technology and communications, net occupancy expense, equipment expense, leasing business expense, marketing expense, card and processing expense and other noninterest expense. 

COVID-19 Global Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic created significant economic uncertainty and financial disruptions during the year ended December 31, 2020, which has continued into 2021. Government and public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary closures of businesses and the implementation of social distancing protocols, have caused and continue to cause, reductions and instability in economic activity that have resulted in increased unemployment levels in certain industries and volatility in the financial markets. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended September 30, 2021, low interest rates, reduced economic activity and market volatility have had the most immediate negative impacts on the Bancorp&#8217;s performance. The Bancorp is unable to estimate the extent of the impact that these factors 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

have had on its operating results since the pandemic began and it is likely that these factors will continue to adversely impact its future operating results. 

Although the increased availability of COVID-19 vaccinations has begun to mitigate the public health effects of the pandemic, there has been a rise of certain variants of COVID-19 and slowing progress on vaccination rates. The recovery from the related economic crisis continues to disproportionately affect certain industries, geographies and demographics more than others, and when combined with the unprecedented nature of the government response to the pandemic, it becomes difficult to predict the extent to which the pandemic will continue to adversely impact the Bancorp and its customers. Furthermore, resurgence risk remains as new virus variants are identified. The Bancorp continues to closely monitor the pandemic and its effects on customers, employees, communities and markets. 

The Bancorp has provided a variety of relief options for both commercial and consumer customers that were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including loan covenant relief, loan maturity extensions, payment deferrals, forbearances and fee waivers. For further information about these programs, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A included herein, and also Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Government Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic 

Congress, the FRB and the other U.S. state and federal financial regulatory agencies have taken actions to mitigate disruptions to economic activity and financial stability resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The descriptions below summarize certain significant government actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions or government programs summarized. 

The CARES Act 

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (&#8220;CARES&#8221;) Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and has subsequently been amended several times, including by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. Among other provisions, the CARES Act included funding for the SBA to expand lending, relief from certain U.S. GAAP requirements to allow COVID-19-related loan modifications to not be categorized as TDRs, direct stimulus payments and a range of incentives to encourage deferment, forbearance or modification of consumer credit and mortgage contracts. One of the key CARES Act programs is the Paycheck Protection Program, discussed further below, which temporarily expanded the SBA&#8217;s business loan guarantee program. 

The CARES Act contained additional protections for homeowners and renters of properties with federally-backed mortgages, including a 60-day moratorium on the initiation of foreclosure proceedings beginning on March 18, 2020 and a 120-day moratorium on initiating eviction proceedings effective March 27, 2020. Borrowers of federally-backed mortgages had the right under the CARES Act to request up to 360 days of forbearance on their mortgage payments if they experienced financial hardship directly or indirectly due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. 

The foreclosure moratorium and forbearance provisions of the CARES Act expired in 2020 but the FHA and FHFA independently extended these assistance programs. The extended foreclosure moratorium expired in the third quarter of 2021. COVID-19 related forbearance opportunities for new enrollees were set to expire on September 30, 2021, though this has been revised and currently the program has no set end date. 

Also pursuant to the CARES Act, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to provide loans, guarantees and other investments in support of eligible businesses, states and municipalities affected by the economic effects of COVID-19. Some of these funds have been used to support several FRB programs and facilities described below or additional programs or facilities that are established by its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act which meet certain criteria. 

FRB Actions 

The FRB has taken a range of actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, offset forced liquidations and restore liquidity in the financial markets. For example, on March 15, 2020, the FRB reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 0.25% and announced that it would increase its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities and begin purchasing agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. The FRB has also encouraged depository institutions to borrow from the discount window and has lowered the primary credit rate for such borrowing by 150 basis points while extending the term of such loans up to 90 days. Reserve requirements have been reduced to zero as of March 26, 2020. 

In addition, the FRB established a range of facilities and programs to support the U.S. economy and U.S. marketplace participants in response to economic disruptions associated with COVID-19. Through these facilities and programs, the FRB, relying on its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, has taken steps to directly or indirectly purchase assets from, or make loans to, U.S. companies, financial institutions, municipalities and other market participants. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Paycheck Protection Program 

The Bancorp is a participating lender in the PPP, which is a program administered by the SBA to provide forgivable, guaranteed loans to eligible borrowers that have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of September 30, 2021, the Bancorp held PPP loans with a carrying amount of $2.3 billion under the program. PPP loans are available to a broader range of entities than ordinary SBA loans, require deferral of principal and interest repayment, and may be forgiven if the borrower demonstrates that the loan proceeds were used for qualified payroll costs and certain other expenses. The PPP was expanded to permit second and third rounds of funding, including for certain borrowers who have already received a PPP loan, subject to certain conditions. The PPP was closed to new originations during the second quarter of 2021. 

American Rescue Plan Act 

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which was signed into law on March 21, 2021, provided additional relief for businesses, states, municipalities and individuals by, among other things, allocating additional funds for the PPP, providing a third round of economic impact payments to individuals, extending supplemental federal unemployment benefits and providing advance payments of an expanded child tax credit. The impacts of the stimulus on the Bancorp&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition are highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and its impact on the economy in general. 

CFPB Final Rule for COVID-19 Mortgage Servicing 

The CFPB issued a final rule, effective August 31, 2021, that amended Regulation X to provide foreclosure protections to borrowers as the federally-backed COVID-19 foreclosure protections expire. The CFPB&#8217;s final rule generally prohibits new foreclosure filings until December 31, 2021, unless certain procedural safeguards are met or an exception applies. Current mortgage servicing rules generally prohibit servicers from offering a borrower a loss mitigation option based on the evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application; however, the final rule creates a new exception that permits servicers to offer certain streamlined loan modifications to borrowers with COVID-19 related hardships based on the evaluation of an incomplete application. The final rule also makes temporary changes to certain required servicer communications that borrowers receive regarding their loss mitigation options. 

Accelerated Share Repurchase Transactions 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Bancorp entered into and settled accelerated share repurchase transactions. As part of the transactions, the Bancorp entered into forward contracts in which the final number of shares delivered at settlement was based generally on a discount to the average daily volume weighted-average price of the Bancorp&#8217;s common stock during the terms of the repurchase agreements. Refer to Note 16 and Note 24 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on share repurchase activity. 

The following table presents a summary of the Bancorp&#8217;s accelerated share repurchase transactions that were entered into and settled during the nine months ended September 30, 2021:

(a) This accelerated share repurchase transaction consisted of two supplemental confirmations each with a notional amount of $275 million. 

LIBOR Transition 

In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the &#8220;FCA&#8221;), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. Since then, central banks globally, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for LIBOR. The Bancorp has substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products within its commercial lending, commercial deposits, business banking, consumer lending and capital markets lines of business as well as corporate treasury function. On November 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC issued a public statement that the administrator of LIBOR announced it will consult on an extension of publication of certain U.S. Dollar (&#8220;USD&#8221;) LIBOR tenors until June 30, 2023, which would allow additional legacy USD LIBOR contracts to mature before the succession of LIBOR. The administrator then announced on March 5, 2021, that it will cease publication of 1-week and 2-month USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021, and that overnight and 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month USD LIBOR will cease to be published on June 30, 2023. Although the full impact of LIBOR reforms and actions remains unclear, the Bancorp is in the process of transitioning from LIBOR to alternative reference rates, including, but not limited to, SOFR and Prime (collectively with other indices, &#8220;Alternative Rates&#8221;), and expects to be fully transitioned away from the use of LIBOR to Alternative Rates for new financial contracts by the end of 2021. There are risks inherent with the transition to any Alternative Rate as the rate may behave differently than LIBOR in reaction to monetary, market and economic events. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The Bancorp&#8217;s LIBOR transition plan is organized around key work streams, including continued engagement with central banks and industry working groups and regulators, active client engagement, comprehensive review of legacy documentation, internal operational and technological readiness and risk management, among other things, to facilitate the transition to Alternative Rates. The Bancorp has also developed a transition plan for existing LIBOR-based financial contracts that are not expected to mature or settle prior to the cessation of LIBOR publication. 

For a further discussion of the various risks the Bancorp faces in connection with the expected replacement of LIBOR on its operations, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Market Risks&#8212;The replacement of LIBOR could adversely affect Fifth Third&#8217;s revenue or expenses and the value of those assets or obligations.&#8221; in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Key Performance Indicators 

The Bancorp, as a banking institution, utilizes various key indicators of financial condition and operating results in managing and monitoring the performance of the business. In addition to traditional financial metrics, such as revenue and expense trends, the Bancorp monitors other financial measures that assist in evaluating growth trends, capital strength and operational efficiencies. The Bancorp analyzes these key performance indicators against its past performance, its forecasted performance and with the performance of its peer banking institutions. These indicators may change from time to time as the operating environment and businesses change. 

The following are some of the key indicators used by management to assess the Bancorp&#8217;s business performance, including those which are considered in the Bancorp&#8217;s compensation programs: 

&#8226; CET1 Capital Ratio: CET1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets as defined by the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets 

&#8226; Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (non-GAAP): Tangible net income available to common shareholders (annualized) divided by average tangible common equity 

&#8226; Net Interest Margin (non-GAAP): Net interest income on an FTE basis (annualized) divided by average interest-earning assets 

&#8226; Efficiency Ratio (non-GAAP): Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income 

&#8226; Earnings Per Share, Diluted: Net income allocated to common shareholders divided by average common shares outstanding after the effect of dilutive stock-based awards 

&#8226; Nonperforming Portfolio Assets Ratio: Nonperforming portfolio assets divided by portfolio loans and leases and OREO 

&#8226; Net Charge-off Ratio: Net losses charged-off (annualized) divided by average portfolio loans and leases 

&#8226; Return on Average Assets: Net income (annualized) divided by quarterly average assets 

&#8226; Loan-to-Deposit Ratio: Total loans divided by total deposits 

The list of indicators above is intended to summarize some of the most important metrics utilized by management in evaluating the Bancorp&#8217;s performance and does not represent an all-inclusive list of all performance measures that may be considered relevant or important to management or investors. Certain financial measures derived from the balance sheet, such as return on average tangible common equity, net interest margin, net charge-off ratio, return on average assets, etc., are annualized throughout this report.

Earnings Summary 

The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2021 was $684 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, which was net of $20 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2020 was $562 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, which was net of $19 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $2.0 billion, or $2.83 per diluted share, which was net of $75 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $754 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, which was net of $69 million in preferred stock dividends. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $19 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income benefited from an increase in average residential mortgage loans, a decrease in rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits and a decrease in wholesale funding costs compa red to the same period in the prior year . Net interest income was also positively impacted by income recognized from PPP loans that were forgiven during the three months ended September 30, 2021. These benefits were partially offset by decreases in average balances and yields for commercial and industrial loans as well as decreases in yields on indirect secured consumer loans due to loan portfolio repricing to lower market interest rates for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $3.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, a decrease of $27 million compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of lower market rates, which decreased the yield on total average loans and leases. In addition to market rate impacts on interest-earning assets, net interest income was also negatively impacted by decreases in average commercial a nd industrial loans, average credit card and average home equity balances for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year . These negative impacts were partially offset by decreases in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income also benefited from increases in average residential mortgage loans and average indirect secured consumer loans and a decrease in average long-term debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. An increase in interest income recognized from PPP loans also positively impacted net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.59% and 2.61% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 2.58% and 2.85% for the comparable periods in the prior year. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The benefit from credit losses was $42 million and $330 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to a benefit from credit losses of $15 million and a provision for credit losses of $1.1 billion during the same periods in the prior year. Provision expense decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by factors which caused decreases in the ACL during those periods including improved economic forecasts and improved credit quality in both the commercial and consumer loan and lease portfolios. Net losses charged off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were 0.08% and 0.35% for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and 0.17% and 0.41% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At September 30, 2021, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO decreased to 0.52% compared to 0.79% at December 31, 2020. For further discussion on credit quality refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Noninterest income increased $114 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in other noninterest income, commercial banking revenue, wealth and asset management revenue, card and processing revenue, mortgage banking net revenue and service charges on deposits. 

Noninterest income increased $283 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in other noninterest income, commercial banking revenue, wealth and asset management revenue, card and processing revenue, service charges on deposits and leasing business revenue, partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking net revenue. 

Noninterest expense increased $11 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in other noninterest expense and technology and communications expense, partially offset by decreases in net occupancy expense, compensation and benefits expense and card and processing expense. 

Noninterest expense increased $59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits expense, other noninterest expense and technology and communications expense, partially offset by decreases in net occupancy expense and card and processing expense. 

For more information on net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense refer to the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The following are non-GAAP financial measures which provide useful insight to the reader of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements but should be supplemental to primary U.S. GAAP measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for the primary U.S. GAAP measures. 

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income on an FTE basis, interest income on an FTE basis, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio to U.S. GAAP:

The Bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial institutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of return on average tangible common equity to U.S. GAAP:

The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio and tangible common equity ratio, in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. As U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. The Bancorp encourages readers to consider its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The following table reconciles non-GAAP capital ratios to U.S. GAAP:

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of a significant new accounting standard applicable to the Bancorp. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the Bancorp&#8217;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Bancorp&#8217;s critical accounting policies include the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. There have been no material changes to the valuation techniques or models during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest incurred on core deposits (includes transaction deposits and other time deposits) and wholesale funding (includes certificates $100,000 and over, other deposits, federal funds purchased, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt). The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Tables 6 and 7 present the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, as well as the relative impact of changes in the average balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses included in average other assets. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $19 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2021 benefited from a $3.9 billion increase in average residential mortgage loans, a $3.0 billion increase in average indirect secured consumer loans, a $4.2 billion decrease in average long-term debt and a decrease of 9 bps in the rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits compared to the same period in the prior year. I nterest income recognized from PPP loans also positively impacted net interest income by $47 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to $33 million in the same period in the prior year. These benefits were partially offset by a decrease in average commercial and industrial loans of $6.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income was also negatively impacted by loan portfolio repricing due to lower market interest rates, in cluding a 66 bps decrease in yields on average indirect secured consumer loans for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $3.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, a decrease of $27 million compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of lower market rates. Monetary policy actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including lowering the target range of the federal funds rate and the FRB&#8217;s bond purchase programs, have continued to adversely impact market rates since March of 2020. Yields on total average loans and leases decreased by 32 bps for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by decreases in yields on average commercial loans and leases and average consumer loans of 23 bps and 54 bps, respectively. The Bancorp has significant portfolios of floating interest rate loans (primarily LIBOR- or Prime-based) that were impacted by decreases in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp&#8217;s portfolios of fixed interest rate loans also decreased in yield as a result of increased refinance activity and lower yields on new originations due to lower overall market rates. In addition to market rate impacts on interest-earning assets, net interest income was also negatively impacted by decreases in average commercial a nd industrial loans, average credit card and average home equity of $6.2 billion, $495 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, from the nine months ended September 30, 2020. These negative impacts were partially offset by decreases in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities, primarily driven by decreases in rates paid on average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits of 27 bps and 34 bps, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from increases in average residential mortgage loans and average indirect secured consumer loans of $3.6 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, and a decrease in average long-term debt of $2.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year . Interest income recognized from PPP loans also positively impacted net interest income by $153 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to $56 million in the same period in the prior year. 

Net interest rate spread on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.45% and 2.46% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 2.42% and 2.62% in the same periods in the prior year. Yields on average interest-earning assets decreased 12 bps and 50 bps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, while rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities decreased 15 bps and 34 bps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.59% and 2.61% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 2.58% and 2.85% for the comparable periods in the prior year. N et interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was negatively impacted by increases in low-yielding reserves held at the FRB reported in other short-term investments, which were primarily driven by increased levels in average demand deposits and average interest-bearing core deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest margin results are expected to remain suppressed as a result of sustained excess cash balances, which are expected to remain elevated, driven by the amount of liquidity injected into the banking system as a result of monetary and fiscal stimulus programs implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from loans and leases decreased $34 million and $322 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 driven by the previously mentioned decreases in yields and average balances of loans and leases. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A. Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from investment securities and other short-term investments decreased $3 million and $20 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to decreases in yields on average taxable securities partially offset by increases in the average balances of other short-term investments and securities exempt from income taxes. 

Interest expense on core deposits decreased $24 million and $212 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to decreases in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 4 bps and 5 bps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, from 13 bps and 35 bps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. The decreases in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits were primarily due to decreases in rates paid on average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s deposits. 

In terest expense on average wholesale funding decreased $32 million and $103 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to decreases in average balances of long-term debt and certificates $100,000 and over and decreases in rates paid on certificates $100,000 and over. Refer to the Borrowings subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s borrowings. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, average wholesale funding represented 13% and 14%, respectively, of average interest-bearing liabilities, compared to 18% and 19%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, see the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Bancorp provides, as an expense, an amount for expected credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded commitments and letters of credit that is based on factors previously discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses expected in the portfolios. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the ALLL. The amount of loans and leases actually removed from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and leases. 

The benefit from credit losses was $42 million and $330 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to a benefit from credit losses of $15 million and a provision for credit losses of $1.1 billion during the same periods in the prior year. Provision expense decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by factors that caused decreases in the ACL during those periods including improved economic forecasts and improved credit quality in both the commercial and consumer loan and lease portfolios. Provision expense was elevated in 2020 as the Bancorp increased its ACL in response to deterioration and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, continued pressure on energy prices and the resulting impact of these factors on commercial borrowers as reflected in increased levels of commercial criticized assets. In the first and second quarters of 2021, the Bancorp decreased the ACL, reflecting credit quality and stabilization in the macroeconomic environment, aided by fiscal and monetary stimulus programs as well as the easing of government-imposed restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the third quarter of 2021, the Bancorp decreased the ACL, reflecting continued improvements in credit quality when compared to the prior quarter amidst relatively consistent expectations for the macroeconomic environment. 

The ALLL decreased $499 million from December 31, 2020 to $2.0 billion at September 30, 2021. At September 30, 2021, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases decreased to 1.81%, compared to 2.25% at December 31, 2020. The reserve for unfunded commitments increased $33 million from December 31, 2020 to $205 million at September 30, 2021. The ACL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases decreased to 2.00% at September 30, 2021, compared to 2.41% at December 31, 2020. 

Refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on the provision for credit losses, including an analysis of loan and lease portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and determining the level of the ACL. 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income increased $114 million and $283 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

The following table presents the components of noninterest income:

Commercial banking revenue 

Commercial banking revenue increased $27 million and $78 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by increases in loan syndication fees, business lending fees and contract revenue from commercial customer derivatives, partially offset by a decrease in institutional sales. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to increases in loan syndication fees, business lending fees and institutional sales, partially offset by a decrease in bridge fees. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Service charges on deposits 

Service charges on deposits increased $8 million and $31 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 due to increases in both commercial deposit fees and consumer deposit fees. 

Wealth and asset management revenue 

Wealth and asset management revenue increased $15 million and $49 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in private client service fees and broker income, partially offset by decreases in institutional fees. The Bancorp&#8217;s trust and registered investment advisory businesses had approximately $541 billion and $422 billion in total assets under care as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and managed $61 billion and $53 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Card and processing revenue 

Card and processing revenue increased $10 million and $38 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to an increase in debit and credit card interchange, partially offset by increased reward costs, all of which were driven by an increase in consumer and business card spend volume. 

Mortgage banking net revenue 

Mortgage banking net revenue increased $10 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and decreased $60 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same periods in the prior year. 

The following table presents the components of mortgage banking net revenue:

Origination fees and gains on loan sales decreased $15 million and $21 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily driven by decreases in gain on sale margins partially offset by gains from sales of forbearance loans that were repurchased from GNMA. Residential mortgage loan originations increased to $5.0 billion and $14.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, from $4.5 billion and $12.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. 

Net mortgage servicing revenue increased $25 million and decreased $39 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in net negative valuation adjustments, partially offset by a decrease in gross mortgage servicing fees. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to an increase in net negative valuation adjustments as well as a decrease in gross mortgage servicing fees. Refer to Table 10 for the components of net valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio and the impact of the non-qualifying hedging strategy.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Bancorp recognized losses of $44 million and $95 million, respectively, in mortgage banking net revenue for valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio. The valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio included increases of $20 million and $123 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, due to changes in market rates and other inputs in the valuation model, including future prepayment speeds and OAS assumptions. Mortgage rates were relatively flat during the three months ended September 30, 2021, however higher swap rates resulted in a reduction to modeled prepayment speeds and a tightening of the spread between mortgage rates and swap rates. Mortgage rates increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2021, which resulted in a reduction to modeled prepayment speeds and a tightening of the spread between mortgage rates and swap rates. There was also an increase in the modeled OAS assumptions for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The fair value of the MSR portfolio also decreased $64 million and $218 million as a result of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. 

Mortgage rates decreased during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, which caused modeled prepayment speeds to rise. Additionally, swap rates increased for the three months ended September 30, 2020, which caused modeled OAS assumptions to increase. The fair value of the MSR portfolio increased $4 million and decreased $340 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, due to changes to inputs to the valuation model, including prepayment speeds and OAS assumptions and decreased $75 million and $179 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, due to the impact of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity. 

Further detail on the valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation of the MSR portfolio. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. 

In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp acquires various securities as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. The Bancorp recognized net losses of an immaterial amount and $2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to net losses of $1 million and net gains of $3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, recorded in securities (losses) gains, net &#8211; non-qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights in the Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s total residential mortgage loans serviced as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 were $92.7 billion and $91.4 billion, respectively, with $77.9 billion and $73.5 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others. 

Leasing business revenue 

Leasing business revenue increased $1 million and $19 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to increases in lease syndication fees and lease remarketing fees, partially offset by a decrease in leasing business solutions revenue. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to an increase in lease syndication fees, partially offset by a decrease in lease remarketing fees.

Other noninterest income increased $94 million and $169 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, primarily due to the recognition of gains on contract sales and an increase in private equity investment income as well as a decrease in net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 also included an increase in equity method investment income, partially offset by a decrease in insurance income. 

Gains on contract sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily included the recognition of a $60 million gain on the sale of the Bancorp&#8217;s HSA deposit portfolio, which was completed in the third quarter of 2021. Private equity investment income increased $19 million and $46 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by the recognition of positive net valuation adjustments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 also included the impact of impairment charges recognized on certain private equity investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. For additional information on the valuation of private equity investments, refer to Note 22 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment decreased $8 million and $22 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by the impact of lower impairment charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared the same periods in the prior year. For additional information, refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity method investment income increased $18 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to gains and proportional earnings recognized on certain equity method investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Insurance income decreased $10 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by the sale of the Bancorp&#8217;s property and casualty insurance business in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Noninterest Expense 

Noninterest expense increased $11 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in other noninterest expense and technology and communications expense, partially offset by decreases in net occupancy expense, compensation and benefits expense and card and processing expense. Noninterest expense increased $59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits expense, other noninterest expense and technology and communications expense, partially offset by decreases in net occupancy expense and card and processing expense.

Compensation and benefits expense decreased $10 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of severance payments made during the three months ended September 30, 2020 and a decrease in base compensation due to a decline in full-time equivalent employees, partially offset by increases in performance-based compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2021. Compensation and benefits expense increased $60 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in performance-based compensation, non-qualified deferred compensation expense and medical expenses due to lower activity in the prior period as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a decrease in base compensation due to a decline in full-time equivalent employees. Full-time equivalent employees totaled 19,171 at September 30, 2021 compared to 20,283 at September 30, 2020. 

Technology and communications expense increased $9 million and $13 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increased investment in strategic initiatives and technology. Net occupancy expense decreased $11 million and $19 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to a reduction of leased square footage. Card and processing expense decreased $10 million and $19 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to contract renegotiations with a third-party vendor.

Other noninterest expense increased $28 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in donations expense, loan and lease expense and travel expense, partially offset by a decrease in FDIC insurance and other taxes. Other noninterest expense increased $22 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in loan and lease expense, donations expense and professional service fees, partially offset by a decrease in losses and adjustments. 

Donations expense increased $16 million and $14 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to a charitable contribution made to the Fifth Third Foundation in the third quarter of 2021. Loan and lease expense increased $13 million and $42 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to an increase in loan servicing expenses associated with the Bancorp&#8217;s purchases of certain government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans in forbearance programs. 

Travel expense increased $8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase in business travel as activity in the prior period was limited by the COVID-19 pandemic. FDIC insurance and other taxes decreased $7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in the FDIC insurance assessment rate. 

Losses and adjustments decreased $45 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decline in credit valuation adjustments on derivatives associated with customer accommodation contracts, partially offset by an increase in legal settlements. Professional service fees increased $13 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in consulting fees and legal fees. 

Applicable Income Taxes 

The Bancorp&#8217;s income before income taxes, applicable income tax expense and effective tax rate are as follows: 

TABLE 14: Applicable Income Taxes For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, ($ in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Income before income taxes $ 895 &#160; 746 2,689 &#160; 1,051 Applicable income tax expense 191 &#160; 165 582 &#160; 228 Effective tax rate 21.3 &#160; &#160;% 22.1 21.6 &#160; 21.6 

Applicable income tax expense for all periods presented includes the benefit from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, and tax credits (and other related tax benefits), partially offset by the effect of proportional amortization of qualifying LIHTC investments and certain nondeductible expenses. The tax credits are primarily associated with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program established under Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC, the Rehabilitation Investment Tax 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC and the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program established under Section 1397E of the IRC. 

The effective tax rate decreased to 21.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to 22.1% for the same period in the prior year primarily related to an increase in excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation.

(b) Includes $39 as of December 31, 2020 of residential mortgage loans previously sold to GNMA for which the Bancorp was deemed to have regained effective control over under ASC Topic 860, but did not exercise its option to repurchase. Refer to Note 15 for further information. 

Total loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale, decreased $409 million from December 31, 2020. The decrease from December 31, 2020 was the result of a $2.6 billion, or 4%, decrease in commercial loans and leases, partially offset by a $2.1 billion, or 5%, increase in consumer loans. 

Commercial loans and leases decreased $2.6 billion from December 31, 2020 due to decreases in commercial and industrial loans, commercial construction loans and commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by an increase in commercial leases. Commercial and industrial loans decreased $2.1 billion, or 4%, from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns in excess of loan originations. Commercial construction loans decreased $359 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2020 as payoffs exceeded draws on existing commitments and loan originations. Commercial mortgage loans decreased $309 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2020 as payoffs exceeded loan originations. Commercial leases increased $176 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of an increase in lease originations. 

Consumer loans increased $2.1 billion from December 31, 2020 primarily due to increases in indirect secured consumer loans and residential mortgage loans, partially offset by decreases in home equity and credit card. Indirect secured consumer loans increased $2.4 billion, or 17%, from December 31, 2020 primarily driven by higher demand and other favorable market conditions, which contributed to increased loan production. Residential mortgage loans increased $966 million, or 5%, from December 31, 2020 primarily due to increases in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp purchased government-guaranteed loans in forbearance programs. Home equity decreased $907 million, or 17%, from December 31, 2020 as payoffs exceeded loan originations. Credit card decreased $263 million, or 13%, from December 31, 2020 primarily due to the cumulative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, including accelerated paydown activity driven by the amount of fiscal stimulus programs and lower consumer demand for credit.

Investment Securities 

The Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing collateral for pledging purposes and for liquidity risk management. Total investment securities we re $38.9 billion and $38.4 billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The taxable available-for-sale debt and other investment securities portfolio had an effective duration o f 5.0 at September 30, 2021 compared to 4.4 at December 31, 2020. 

Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in management&#8217;s judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. Securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities are classified as trading when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the ne ar term. At September 30, 2021, the B ancorp&#8217;s investment portfolio consisted primarily o f AAA-rated available-for-sale debt and other securities. The Bancorp held an immaterial amount of below-investment grade available-for-sale debt and other securities at both 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. During the three and nine months ended September 30 2021, the Bancorp recognized $12 million and $19 million, respectively, of impairment losses on its available-for-sale debt and other securities, included in securities gains (losses), net, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. These losses related to certain securities in unrealized loss positions that the Bancorp intended to sell prior to recovery of their amortized cost bases. The Bancorp did not consider these losses to be credit-related. 

At both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Bancorp completed its evaluation of the available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position and did not recognize an allowance for credit losses. The Bancorp did not recognize provision expense related to available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of investment securities:

(a) Other securities consist of FHLB, FRB and DTCC restricted stock hold ings of $31, $485 and $2, respectively, at September 30, 2021 and $40, $482 and $2, respectively, at December 31, 2020, that are carried at cost. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities in creased $1.3 billion from December 31, 2020 primarily due to increases in agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities and other debt securities, partially offset by a decrease in agency residential mortgage-backed securities. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities were 20% and 19% of total interest-earning assets at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities port folio was 6.6 years at September 30, 2021 compared to 5.7 years at December 31, 2020. In addition, at September 30, 2021, the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 2.81% compared to 3.05% at December 31, 2020. 

Information presented in Table 18 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is presented on an FTE basis and is computed using amortized cost balances and reflects the impact of prepayments. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio exclude other securities that have no stated yield or maturity. Total net unrealized gains on the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio were $1.6 billion at September 30, 2021 compared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2020. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally increases when interest rates decrease or when credit spreads contract.

(a) Includes $297 million and $1.3 billion of institutional, retail and wholesale certificates $250,000 and over at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Core deposits increased $7.3 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2020 as a result of an increase in transaction deposits, partially offset by a decrease in other time deposits. Transaction deposits increased $8.1 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2020 primarily due to increases in demand deposits and savings deposits, partially offset by a decrease in interest checking deposits. Demand deposits increased $6.2 billion, or 11%, from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of customers maintaining increased levels of liquidity driven by the amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus, as well as growth in the number of accounts and migration of balances from interest checking deposits during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Savings deposits increased $3.2 billion, or 17%, from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of higher balances per customer account due to the amount of fiscal stimulus as well as decreased consumer outflows. Interest checking deposits decreased $1.3 billion, or 3%, from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of lower balances per customer account as well as the aforementioned balance migration into demand deposits during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Other time deposits decreased $819 million, or 27%, from December 31, 2020 primarily due to lower offering rates on certificates less than $100,000. 

Certificates $100,000 and over decreased $1.2 billion, or 61%, from December 31, 2020 primarily due to maturities which were not replaced with new issuances given current market conditions and liquidity levels.
