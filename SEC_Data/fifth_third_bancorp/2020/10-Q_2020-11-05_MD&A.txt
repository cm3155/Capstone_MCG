FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This report contains statements that we believe are &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 175 promulgated thereunder, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 3b-6 promulgated thereunder. These statements relate to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance or business. They usually can be identified by the use of forward-looking language such as &#8220;will likely result,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;are expected to,&#8221; &#8220;is anticipated,&#8221; &#8220;potential,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;forecast,&#8221; &#8220;projected,&#8221; &#8220;intends to,&#8221; or may include other similar words or phrases such as &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;trend,&#8221; &#8220;objective,&#8221; &#8220;continue,&#8221; &#8220;remain,&#8221; or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;can,&#8221; or similar verbs. You should not place undue reliance on these statements, as they are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risk factors set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated by our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind these risks and uncertainties, as well as any cautionary statements we may make. Moreover, you should treat these statements as speaking only as of the date they are made and based only on information then actually known to us. There are a number of important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (1) effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic; (2) deteriorating credit quality; (3) loan concentration by location or industry of borrowers or collateral; (4) problems encountered by other financial institutions; (5) inadequate sources of funding or liquidity; (6) unfavorable actions of rating agencies; (7) inability to maintain or grow deposits; (8) limitations on the ability to receive dividends from subsidiaries; (9) cyber-security risks; (10) Fifth Third&#8217;s ability to secure confidential information and deliver products and services through the use of computer systems and telecommunications networks; (11) failures by third-party service providers; (12) inability to manage strategic initiatives and/or organizational changes; (13) inability to implement technology system enhancements; (14) failure of internal controls and other risk management systems; (15) losses related to fraud, theft, misappropriation or violence; (16) inability to attract and retain skilled personnel; (17) adverse impacts of government regulation; (18) governmental or regulatory changes or other actions; (19) failures to meet applicable capital requirements; (20) regulatory objections to Fifth Third&#8217;s capital plan; (21) regulation of Fifth Third&#8217;s derivatives activities; (22) deposit insurance premiums; (23) assessments for the orderly liquidation fund; (24) replacement of LIBOR; (25) weakness in the national or local economies; (26) global political and economic uncertainty or negative actions; (27) changes in interest rates; (28) changes and trends in capital markets; (29) fluctuation of Fifth Third&#8217;s stock price; (30) volatility in mortgage banking revenue; (31) litigation, investigations and enforcement proceedings by governmental authorities; (32) breaches of contractual covenants, representations and warranties; (33) competition and changes in the financial services industry; (34) changing retail distribution strategies, customer preferences and behavior; (35) difficulties in identifying, acquiring or integrating suitable strategic partnerships, investments or acquisitions; (36) potential dilution from future acquisitions; (37) loss of income and/or difficulties encountered in the sale and separation of businesses, investments or other assets; (38) results of investments or acquired entities; (39) changes in accounting standards or interpretation or declines in the value of Fifth Third&#8217;s goodwill or other intangible assets; (40) inaccuracies or other failures from the use of models; (41) effects of critical accounting policies and judgments or the use of inaccurate estimates; (42) weather-related events, other natural disasters, or health emergencies; and (43) the impact of reputational risk created by these or other developments on such matters as business generation and retention, funding and liquidity.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

OVERVIEW 

Fifth Third Bancorp is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. At September 30, 2020, the Bancorp had $202 billion in assets and operated 1,122 full-service banking centers and 2,414 Fifth Third branded ATMs in eleven states throughout the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the U.S. The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Wealth and Asset Management. 

This overview of MD&#38;A highlights selected information in the financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document as well as the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorp&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, refer to the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool for the reader of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD&#38;A, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Net interest income, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD&#38;A on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. The FTE basis for presenting net interest income is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&#38;A. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 62% and 38% of total revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 64% and 36% of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers domiciled in the U.S. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A, risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the Bancorp. 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio, as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral. 

Noninterest income is derived from service charges on deposits, wealth and asset management revenue, commercial banking revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, card and processing revenue, leasing business revenue, other noninterest income and net securities gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes compensation and benefits, technology and communications costs, net occupancy expense, leasing business expense, equipment expense, card and processing expense, marketing expense and other noninterest expense. 

COVID-19 Global Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced significant economic uncertainty during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. To address concerns that COVID-19 may overwhelm the health care system, states across the U.S. declared lockdowns that restricted social gatherings and ordered temporary closures of businesses deemed non-essential. Despite the partial lifting of these measures in some of the states in the Bancorp&#8217;s geographic footprint, the recent fluctuations in the number of COVID-19 cases mean that it remains unknown when there will be a return to normal economic activity. During the third quarter of 2020, the Bancorp observed the impact of the pandemic on its business. The decline of asset prices, reduction in interest rates, widening of credit spreads, borrower and counterparty credit deterioration and market volatility had the most immediate negative impacts on current performance. Although the Bancorp is unable to estimate the extent of the impact, the continuing pandemic and related global economic crisis will adversely impact its future operating results. 

As the cases of COVID-19 continued to rise, the disruption in the financial markets led the FRB to enact unprecedented policies to offset forced liquidations and restore liquidity in the financial markets. The FRB cut rates to the zero lower bound, announced unlimited purchases 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

of treasuries along with agency mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and announced several facilities designed to support the smooth functioning of credit markets. 

Government Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic 

Congress, the FRB and the other U.S. state and federal financial regulatory agencies have taken actions to mitigate disruptions to economic activity and financial stability resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The descriptions below summarize certain significant government actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions or government programs summarized. 

The CARES Act 

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (&#8220;CARES&#8221;) Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and has subsequently been amended several times. Among other provisions, the CARES Act includes funding for the SBA to expand lending, relief from certain U.S. GAAP requirements to allow COVID-19-related loan modifications to not be categorized as TDRs and a range of incentives to encourage deferment, forbearance or modification of consumer credit and mortgage contracts. One of the key CARES Act programs is the Paycheck Protection Program, which temporarily expanded the SBA&#8217;s business loan guarantee program. Paycheck Protection Program loans were available to a broader range of entities than ordinary SBA loans, deferred principal and interest repayment and may be forgiven if the borrower demonstrates that the loan proceeds were used for qualified payroll costs and certain other expenses. 

The CARES Act contains additional protections for homeowners and renters of properties with federally-backed mortgages, including a 60-day moratorium on the initiation of foreclosure proceedings beginning on March 18, 2020 and a 120-day moratorium on initiating eviction proceedings effective March 27, 2020. Borrowers of federally-backed mortgages have the right under the CARES Act to request up to 360 days of forbearance on their mortgage payments if they experience financial hardship directly or indirectly due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. The Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have independently extended their moratorium on foreclosures and evictions for single-family federally backed mortgages until at least December 31, 2020. 

Also pursuant to the CARES Act, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to provide loans, guarantees and other investments in support of eligible businesses, states and municipalities affected by the economic effects of COVID-19. Some of these funds have been used to support several FRB programs and facilities described below or additional programs or facilities that are established by its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act and meeting certain criteria. 

FRB Actions 

The FRB has taken a range of actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. For example, on March 15, 2020, the FRB reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 0.25% and announced that it would increase its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities and begin purchasing agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. The FRB has also encouraged depository institutions to borrow from the discount window and has lowered the primary credit rate for such borrowing by 150 basis points while extending the term of such loans up to 90 days. Reserve requirements have been reduced to zero as of March 26, 2020. 

In addition, the FRB has established, or has taken steps to establish, a range of facilities and programs to support the U.S. economy and U.S. marketplace participants in response to economic disruptions associated with COVID-19. Through these facilities and programs, the FRB, relying on its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, has taken steps to directly or indirectly purchase assets from, or make loans to, U.S. companies, financial institutions, municipalities and other market participants. 

FRB facilities and programs established, or in the process of being established, include: 

&#8226; Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility to provide financing related to Paycheck Protection Program loans made by banks; 

&#8226; Main Street New Loan Facility, a Main Street Priority Loan Facility, and a Main Street Expanded Loan Facility to purchase loan participations, under specified conditions, from banks lending to small and medium U.S. businesses; 

&#8226; Primary Dealer Credit Facility to provide liquidity to primary dealers through a secured lending facility; 

&#8226; Commercial Paper Funding Facility to purchase the commercial paper of certain U.S. issuers; 

&#8226; Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility to purchase corporate bonds directly from, or make loans directly to, eligible participants; 

&#8226; Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility to purchase corporate bonds trading in secondary markets, including from exchange-traded funds, that were issued by eligible participants; 

&#8226; Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to make loans secured by asset-backed securities; 

&#8226; Municipal Liquidity Facility to purchase bonds directly from U.S. state, city and county issuers; and 

&#8226; Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility to purchase certain assets from, or make loans to, financial institutions providing financing to eligible money market mutual funds. 

These facilities and programs are in various stages of development, and the Bancorp and the Bank currently, or may in the future participate in some of them, including as an agent or intermediary on behalf of clients or customers or in an advisory capacity. For commercial and consumer customers, Fifth Third has provided a host of relief options, including loan covenant relief, loan maturity extensions, payment deferrals, forbearances and fee waivers. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Paycheck Protection Program 

As previously discussed, the Bancorp is participating in the SBA&#8217;s Paycheck Protection Program which was created by the CARES Act on March 27, 2020. As of September 30, 2020, the Bancorp held approximately 40,000 loans with a carrying amount of $5.2 billion under the program. 

For further discussion on Fifth Third&#8217;s hardship relief programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A and Note 4 and Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the &#8220;FCA&#8221;), which regulates LIBOR, announced that FCA will stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. Since then, central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for LIBOR. The Bancorp has substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products within its commercial lending, commercial deposits, business banking, consumer lending and capital markets lines of business as well as corporate treasury function. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative reference rates will occur by the end of 2021. Although the full impact of such reforms and actions remains unclear, the Bancorp continues to prepare to transition from LIBOR to these alternative reference rates. In the United States, it is likely that LIBOR-priced transactions and products will transfer to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;). There are risks inherent with the transition to any alternative rate such as SOFR as the rates may behave differently than LIBOR in reaction to monetary, market and economic events. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s LIBOR transition plan is organized around key work streams, including continued engagement with central bank and industry working groups and regulators, active client engagement, comprehensive review of legacy documentation, internal operational and technological readiness, and risk management, among other things, to facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates. 

For a further discussion of the various risks the Bancorp faces in connection with the expected replacement of LIBOR on its operations, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Market Risks&#8212;The replacement of LIBOR could adversely affect Fifth Third&#8217;s revenue or expenses and the value of those assets or obligations.&#8221; in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Key Performance Indicators 

The Bancorp, as a banking institution, utilizes various key indicators of financial condition and operating results in managing and monitoring the performance of the business. In addition to traditional financial metrics, such as revenue and expense trends, the Bancorp monitors other financial measures that assist in evaluating growth trends, capital strength and operational efficiencies. The Bancorp analyzes these key performance indicators against its past performance, its forecasted performance and with the performance of its peer banking institutions. These indicators may change from time to time as the operating environment and businesses change. 

The following are key performance indicators used by management to make operating decisions and evaluate capital utilization: 

&#8226; CET1 Capital Ratio: CET1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets as defined by the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

&#8226; Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (non-GAAP): Tangible net income available to common shareholders divided by average tangible common equity 

&#8226; Efficiency Ratio: Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) and noninterest income 

&#8226; Earnings Per Share, Diluted: Net income allocated to common shareholders divided by average common shares outstanding after the effect of dilutive stock-based awards 

&#8226; Nonperforming Portfolio Assets Ratio: Nonperforming portfolio assets divided by portfolio loans and leases and OREO 

&#8226; Return on Average Assets: Net income annualized divided by quarterly average assets 

Earnings Summary 

The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2020 was $562 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, which was net of $19 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2019 was $530 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, which was net of $19 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $754 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, which was net of $69 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $1.7 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, which was net of $60 million in preferred stock dividends. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2020, a decrease of $73 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income was negatively impacted by decreases in yields on average interest-earning assets of 141 bps. The decreases in yields on average interest-earning assets were primarily driven by decreases in yields on total average loans and leases primarily as a result of decreases in yields on average commercial and industrial loans, average commercial mortgage loans, average commercial construction loans and average home equity rates of 131 bps, 174 bps, 221 bps and 161 bps, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. The net interest income impact of lower yields on average interest-earning assets was partially offset by decreases in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities of 90 bps. The decreases in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities were primarily driven by decreases in rates paid on average interest checking deposits, average money market deposits and average long-term debt rates of 102 bps, 99 bps and 64 bps, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from increases in average commercial and industrial loans and average indirect secured consumer loans of $2.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $3.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of $28 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income was positively impacted by decreases in the rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities of 71 bps. The decreases in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities were primarily driven by decreases in rates paid on average interest checking deposits, average money market deposits and average long-term debt of 82 bps, 73 bps and 49 bps, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from increases in average commercial and industrial loans, average indirect secured consumer loans and average commercial mortgage loans of $5.1 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. These positive impacts were partially offset by decreases in yields on average interest-earning assets of 101 bps. The decreases in yields on average interest-earning assets were primarily driven by decreases in yields on total average loans and leases primarily driven by decreases in yields on average commercial and industrial loans, average commercial mortgage loans, average commercial construction loans and average home equity rates of 104 bps, 128 bps, 173 bps and 130 bps, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income was also negatively impacted by increases in average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits of $10.6 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.58% and 2.85% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to 3.32% for both the comparable periods in the prior year. 

Effective January 1, 2020, the Bancorp adopted ASU 2016-13 which established a new approach for estimating credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. The Bancorp recognized an initial increase to the ACL of approximately $653 million upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, which included $171 million from the non-PCD loan portfolio resulting from the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition. The benefit from credit losses was $15 million and the provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the provision for credit losses of $134 million and $310 million during the same periods in the prior year. The decrease in provision expense for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by factors which caused a decrease in the ACL from the second quarter of 2020 including improved economic forecasts, improved consumer credit quality and lower period-end loan and lease balances, partially offset by continued increases in commercial criticized assets and nonperforming loans. The increase in provision expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the ACL reflecting deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, continued pressure on energy prices and the resulting impact of this environment on commercial borrowers as reflected in increased levels of commercial criticized assets. The change in the provision for credit losses for both periods also reflected the impact of the change in methodology for estimating credit losses from the incurred loss methodology to the expected credit loss methodology beginning in the first quarter of 2020. Net losses charged off as a percent of average portfolio loans and 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

leases were 0.35% and 0.36% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 0.41% and 0.32% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At September 30, 2020, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO increased to 0.84% compared to 0.62% at December 31, 2019. For further discussion on credit quality refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Noninterest income decreased $18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in other noninterest income, mortgage banking net revenue and leasing business revenue, partially offset by an increase in wealth and asset management revenue. Other noninterest income decreased $38 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in private equity investment income as well as increases in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares and the net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment. Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $19 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net mortgage servicing revenue. Leasing business revenue decreased $15 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in lease remarketing fees and operating lease income. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by increases in private client service fees and broker income. 

Noninterest income decreased $458 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in other noninterest income, partially offset by increases in mortgage banking net revenue, commercial banking revenue and wealth and asset management revenue. Other noninterest income decreased $637 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to the gain on sale of Worldpay, Inc. shares recognized during the first quarter of 2019 as well as a decrease in private equity investment income and an increase in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares. Mortgage banking net revenue increased $81 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in origination fees and gains on loan sales partially offset by a decrease in net mortgage servicing revenue. Commercial banking revenue increased $54 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by increases in institutional sales and bridge fees partially offset by a decrease in loan syndication fees. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $29 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in private client service fees, broker income and institutional fees. 

Noninterest expense increased $2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by decreases in other noninterest expense, marketing expense and technology and communications expense. The Bancorp recognized an immaterial amount of merger-related expenses related to the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $28 million in the same period in the prior year. Compensation and benefits expense increased $53 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of strategic hiring, the impact of raising the Bancorp's minimum wage in the fourth quarter of 2019 and an increase in severance expense. Other noninterest expense decreased $20 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in travel expense and professional service fees, partially offset by an increase in FDIC insurance and other taxes. Marketing expense decreased $17 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a pause or slowdown in numerous marketing campaigns, including running less advertising as well as the suspension of cash bonus and other account acquisition programs. Technology and communications expense decreased $11 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by decreased integration and conversion costs related to the acquisition of MB Financial, Inc. 

Noninterest expense decreased $17 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in technology and communications expense and marketing expense, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits expense. The Bancorp recognized $16 million of merger-related expenses related to the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $213 million in the same period in the prior year. Technology and communications expense decreased $47 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by decreased integration and conversion costs related to the acquisition of MB Financial, Inc. Marketing expense decreased $43 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a pause or slowdown in numerous marketing campaigns, including running less advertising as well as the suspension of cash bonus and other account acquisition programs. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $68 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of strategic hiring and the impact of raising the Bancorp's minimum wage in the fourth quarter of 2019. Compensation and benefits expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 included $10 million of special payments to employees providing essential banking services through the COVID-19 pandemic.

Capital Summary 

The Bancorp calculated its regulatory capital ratios under the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets and pursuant to the five-year transition provision option to phase in the effects of CECL on regulatory capital as of September 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2020, the Bancorp&#8217;s capital ratios, as defined by the U.S. banking agencies, were: 

&#8226; CET1 capital ratio: 10.14%; 

&#8226; Tier I risk-based capital ratio: 11.64%; 

&#8226; Total risk-based capital ratio: 14.93%; 

&#8226; Tier I leverage ratio: 8.37% 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The following are non-GAAP measures which provide useful insight to the reader of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements but should be supplemental to primary U.S. GAAP measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for the primary U.S. GAAP measures. 

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income on an FTE basis, interest income on an FTE basis, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio to U.S. GAAP:

The Bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial institutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of return on average tangible common equity to U.S. GAAP.

The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio and tangible common equity ratio, in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. Because U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. The Bancorp encourages readers to consider its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of the significant new accounting standards applicable to the Bancorp and the expected impact of significant accounting standards issued, but not yet required to be adopted. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the Bancorp&#8217;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Bancorp&#8217;s critical accounting policies include the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. On January 1, 2020, the Bancorp adopted ASU 2016 - 13 (&#8220;Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments&#8221;) and its related subsequent amendments, along with ASU 2017 - 04 (&#8220;Intangibles&#8212;Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment&#8221;). For additional information about these ASUs and their impacts on the Bancorp, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. In conjunction with the adoption of these ASUs, the Bancorp has revised its Critical Accounting Policies for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments and goodwill as described below. Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for discussion on the critical accounting policies for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments and goodwill for periods prior to January 1, 2020. There have been no other material changes to the valuation techniques or models during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

ALLL 

The Bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the ALLL. The Bancorp&#8217;s portfolio segments include commercial, residential mortgage and consumer. The Bancorp further disaggregates its portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. For an analysis of the Bancorp&#8217;s ALLL by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class, refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related loans and leases. Contractual terms are adjusted for expected prepayments but are not adjusted for expected extensions, renewals or modifications except in circumstances where the Bancorp reasonably expects to execute a TDR with the borrower or where certain extension or renewal options are embedded in the original contract and not unconditionally cancellable by the Bancorp. Accrued interest receivables on loans are presented in other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. When accrued interest is deemed to be uncollectible (typically when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status), interest income is reversed. The Bancorp follows established policies for placing loans on nonaccrual status, so uncollectible accrued interest receivable is reversed in a timely manner. As a result, the Bancorp has elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables. For additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s accounting policies related to nonaccrual loans and leases, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the ALLL. The ALLL is maintained at a level the Bancorp considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability of loans and leases, including historical credit loss experience, current and forecasted market and economic conditions and consideration of various qualitative factors that, in management&#8217;s judgment, deserve consideration in estimating expected credit losses. Provisions for credit losses are recorded for the amounts necessary to adjust the ALLL to the Bancorp&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses on portfolio loans and leases. The Bancorp&#8217;s strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below legal lending limits and conservative underwriting, documentation and collections standards. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL requires significant management judgment and includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans and leases which are individually evaluated. 

Larger commercial loans and leases included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that have been modified in a TDR, are individually evaluated for an ALLL. The Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantor&#8217;s liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan or lease structure and other factors when determining the amount of the ALLL. Other factors may include the borrower&#8217;s susceptibility to risks presented by the forecasted macroeconomic environment, the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower and the Bancorp&#8217;s evaluation of the borrower&#8217;s management. Significant management judgment is required when evaluating which of these factors are most relevant in individual circumstances, and when estimating the amount of expected credit losses based on those factors. When loans and leases are individually evaluated, allowances are determined based on management&#8217;s estimate of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan or lease given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow, as well as an 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

evaluation of legal options available to the Bancorp. Allowances for individually evaluated loans and leases that are collateral-dependent are typically measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less expected costs to sell. Individually evaluated loans and leases that are not collateral-dependent are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate. The Bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual. Specific allowances on individually evaluated commercial loans and leases, including TDRs, are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. 

Expected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for loans and leases that are not individually evaluated. These include commercial loans and leases that do not meet the criteria for individual evaluation as well as homogeneous loans in the residential mortgage and consumer portfolio segments. For collectively evaluated loans and leases, the Bancorp uses models to forecast expected credit losses based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers prepayments and, for loans with available credit, expected utilization rates. The Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models were developed based on historical credit loss experience and observations of migration patterns for various credit risk characteristics (such as internal credit risk grades, external credit ratings or scores, delinquency status, loan-to-value trends, etc.) over time, with those observations evaluated in the context of concurrent macroeconomic conditions. The Bancorp developed its models from historical observations capturing a full economic cycle when possible. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. Generally, the Bancorp considers its forecasts to be reasonable and supportable for a period of up to three years from the estimation date. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, expected credit losses are estimated by reverting to historical loss information without adjustment for changes in economic conditions. This reversion is phased in ratably over a two-year period. The Bancorp evaluates the length of its reasonable and supportable forecast period, its reversion period and reversion methodology at least annually, or more often if warranted by economic conditions or other circumstances. 

The Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the ALLL. These considerations inherently require significant management judgment to determine the appropriate factors to be considered and the extent of their impact on the ALLL estimate. Qualitative factors are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses but that are not fully captured within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models. These include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, lending and risk management personnel and results of internal audit and quality control reviews. These may also include adjustments, when deemed necessary, for specific idiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events, natural disasters and their effects on regional borrowers and changes in product structures. Qualitative factors may also be used to address the impacts of unforeseen events on key inputs and assumptions within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models, such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period, changes to historical loss information or changes to the reversion period or methodology. When evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is also given to regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated effect that changing economic conditions may have on the Bancorp&#8217;s customers. 

Overall, the collective evaluation process requires significant management judgment when determining the estimation methodology and inputs into the models, as well as in evaluating the reasonableness of the modeled results and the appropriateness of qualitative adjustments. The Bancorp&#8217;s forecasts of market and economic conditions and the internal risk grades assigned to loans and leases in the commercial portfolio segment are examples of inputs to the expected credit loss models that require significant management judgment. These inputs have the potential to drive significant variability in the resulting ALLL. 

Refer to the Allowance for Credit Losses subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for a discussion on the Bancorp&#8217;s ALLL sensitivity analysis. 

Reserve for Unfunded Commitments 

The reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated expected credit losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the commitments, taking into consideration the current funded balance and estimated exposure over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. This process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the Bancorp&#8217;s ALLL, as previously discussed. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in provision for credit losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Goodwill 

Business combinations entered into by the Bancorp typically include the recognition of goodwill. U.S. GAAP requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Bancorp is September 30, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Impairment exists when a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In testing goodwill for impairment, U.S. GAAP permits the Bancorp to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In this qualitative assessment, the Bancorp evaluates events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, the general economic environment, banking industry and market conditions, the overall financial performance of the Bancorp, the performance of the Bancorp&#8217;s common stock, the key financial performance metrics of the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting units and events affecting the reporting units to determine if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the quantitative impairment test is required or the decision to bypass the qualitative assessment is elected, the Bancorp performs the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. A recognized impairment loss cannot be reversed in future periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit subsequently recovers. 

The fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As none of the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the Bancorp&#8217;s stock price. The determination of the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. The Bancorp employs an income-based approach, utilizing the reporting unit&#8217;s forecasted cash flows (including a terminal value approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the forecast) and the reporting unit&#8217;s estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. Significant management judgment is necessary in the preparation of each reporting unit&#8217;s forecasted cash flows surrounding expectations for earnings projections, growth and credit loss expectations and actual results may differ from forecasted results. Additionally, the Bancorp determines its market capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the Bancorp&#8217;s stock during the month including the measurement date, incorporating an additional control premium, and compares this market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of the Bancorp&#8217;s reporting units in order to corroborate the results of the income approach. The Bancorp completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2020 and concluded that the fair values of each of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts. While the Bancorp concluded that its goodwill was not impaired as of September 30, 2020, further deterioration in economic conditions could significantly impact the impairment analysis and may result in future goodwill impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on the Bancorp&#8217;s results of operations in the period such charges are recognized. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Bancorp&#8217;s goodwill.

STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest incurred on core deposits (includes transaction deposits and other time deposits) and wholesale funding (includes certificates $100,000 and over, other deposits, federal funds purchased, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt). The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Tables 5 and 6 present the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, as well as the relative impact of changes in the average balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses included in average other assets. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2020, a decrease of $73 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income was negatively impacted by decreases in yields on average interest-earning assets of 141 bps. The decreases in yields on average interest-earning assets were primarily driven by decreases in yields on total average loans and leases primarily as a result of decreases in yields on average commercial and industrial loans, average commercial mortgage loans, average commercial construction loans and average home equity rates of 131 bps, 174 bps, 221 bps and 161 bps, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in yields on total average loans and leases for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in market rates, impacting the Bancorp&#8217;s portfolios of floating interest rate loans, which are primarily LIBOR- and Prime-based. The Bancorp&#8217;s portfolios of fixed interest rate loans also decreased in yield as a result of increased refinance activity and lower reinvestment yields due to lower overall market rates. The net interest income impact of lower yields on average interest-earning assets was partially offset by decreases in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities of 90 bps. The decreases in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities were primarily driven by decreases in rates paid on average interest checking deposits, average money market deposits and average long-term debt rates of 102 bps, 99 bps and 64 bps, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from increases in average commercial and industrial loans and average indirect secured consumer loans of $2.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $3.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of $28 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income was positively impacted by decreases in the rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities of 71 bps. The decreases in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities were primarily driven by decreases in rates paid on average interest checking deposits, average money market deposits and average long-term debt of 82 bps, 73 bps and 49 bps, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from increases in average commercial and industrial loans, average indirect secured consumer loans and average commercial mortgage loans of $5.1 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. These positive impacts were partially offset by decreases in yields on average interest-earning assets of 101 bps. The decreases in yields on average interest-earning assets were primarily driven by decreases in yields on total average loans and leases primarily driven by decreases in yields on average commercial and industrial loans, average commercial mortgage loans, average commercial construction loans and average home equity rates of 104 bps, 128 bps, 173 bps and 130 bps, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income was also negatively impacted by increases in average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits of $10.6 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Net interest income for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in the prior year was adversely impacted by the March 2020, October 2019, September 2019 and August 2019 decisions of the FOMC to lower the target range of the federal funds rate. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, net interest income included $13 million and $44 million, respectively, of amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts on acquired loans and leases and assumed deposits and long-term debt from acquisitions compared to $28 million and $47 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. 

Net interest rate spread on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.42% and 2.62% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to 2.93% and 2.92% in the same periods in the prior year. Yields on average interest-earning assets decreased 141 bps and 101 bps, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, partially offset by decreases in the rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities of 90 bps and 71 bps, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.58% and 2.85% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to 3.32% for both the comparable periods in the prior year. Net interest margin was negatively impacted by increases in average interest-earning assets of $31.9 billion and $25.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, which was primarily attributable to growth in low yielding cash balances reported in other short-term investments. These negative impacts were partially offset by increases in average free funding balances primarily driven by increases in average demand deposits of $15.2 billion and $10.1 billion, respectively, and average shareholders&#8217; equity of $1.7 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in the prior year. Net interest margin results are expected to remain suppressed as a result of increased liquidity levels in the form of excess cash balances which are expected to remain at elevated levels driven by the amount of fiscal stimulus that has increased the banking industry&#8217;s balance sheets, including the Bancorp&#8217;s. 

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from loans and leases decreased $274 million and $406 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 driven by the previously mentioned decreases in yields on average loans and leases, partially offset by increases in average commercial and industrial loans, average indirect secured consumer loans and average commercial mortgage loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in the prior year. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A. Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from investment securities and other short-term investments decreased $23 million and $34 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to decreases in yields on average other short-term investments and average taxable securities, partially offset by increases in average balances. 

Interest expense on core deposits decreased $181 million and $361 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to decreases in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 13 bps and 35 bps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, from 101 bps for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decreases in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits were primarily due to the previously mentioned decreases in the rates paid on average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s deposits. 

Interest expense on average wholesale funding decreased $43 million and $107 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to the previously mentioned decreases in rates paid on average long-term debt as well as decreases in rates paid on average other short-term borrowings and average certificates $100,000 and over. Refer to the Borrowings subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s borrowings. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, average wholesale funding represented 18% and 19%, respectively, of average interest-bearing liabilities, compared to 21% and 22% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, see the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A.

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Bancorp provides as an expense an amount for expected credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit that is based on factors discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses expected in the portfolios. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the ALLL. The amount of loans and leases actually removed from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged off loans and leases. 

The benefit from credit losses was $15 million and the provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the provision for credit losses of $134 million and $310 million during the same periods in the prior year. The decrease in provision expense for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by factors which caused a decrease in the ACL from the second quarter of 2020 including improved economic forecasts, improved consumer credit quality and lower period-end loan and lease balances, partially offset by continued increases in commercial criticized assets and nonperforming loans. The increase in provision expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the ACL reflecting deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, continued pressure on energy prices and the resulting impact of this environment on commercial borrowers as reflected in increased levels of commercial criticized assets. The change in the provision for credit losses for both periods also reflected the impact of the change in methodology for estimating credit losses from the incurred loss methodology to the expected credit loss methodology beginning in the first quarter of 2020. 

The ALLL increased $1.4 billion from December 31, 2019 to $2.6 billion at September 30, 2020. At September 30, 2020, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases increased to 2.32%, compared to 1.10% at December 31, 2019. The reserve for unfunded commitments increased $38 million from December 31, 2019 to $182 million at September 30, 2020. The ACL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases increased to 2.49% at September 30, 2020, compared to 1.23% at December 31, 2019. These increases reflect the adoption of ASU 2016-13, which resulted in a combined increase to the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments of approximately $653 million, as well as the previously mentioned items impacting the provision for (benefit from) credit losses. 

Refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on the provision for (benefit from) credit losses, including an analysis of loan and lease portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio, ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments. 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income decreased $18 million and $458 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

The following table presents the components of noninterest income:

Service charges on deposits 

Service charges on deposits increased $1 million and decreased $3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by an increase in commercial deposit fees of $9 million partially offset by a decrease in consumer deposit fees of $8 million. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

the prior year was due to a decrease of $24 million in consumer deposit fees partially offset by an increase of $21 million in commercial deposit fees. 

Wealth and asset management revenue 

Wealth and asset management revenue increased $8 million and $29 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily driven by increases in private client service fees of $5 million and $13 million, respectively, and broker income of $4 million and $12 million, respectively. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 also included the impact of an increase in institutional fees of $5 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The Bancorp&#8217;s trust and registered investment advisory businesses had approximately $422 billion and $397 billion in total assets under care as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and managed $53 billion and $46 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Commercial banking revenue 

Commercial banking revenue increased $2 million and $54 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to an increase in institutional sales of $16 million partially offset by decreases in contract revenue from commercial customer derivatives and loan syndication fees of $7 million and $6 million, respectively. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by increases in institutional sales and bridge fees of $58 million and $9 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in loan syndication fees of $19 million. 

Mortgage banking net revenue 

Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $19 million and increased $81 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

The following table presents the components of mortgage banking net revenue: 

TABLE 8: Components of Mortgage Banking Net Revenue For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, ($ in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Origination fees and gains on loan sales $ 93 &#160; 64 269 &#160; 126 Net mortgage servicing revenue: Gross mortgage servicing fees 66 &#160; 71 197 &#160; 196 Net valuation adjustments on MSRs and free-standing derivatives purchased to economically hedge MSRs

Origination fees and gains on loan sales increased $29 million and $143 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily driven by an increase in originations and gain on sale margins due to the lower interest rate environment. Residential mortgage loan originations increased to $4.5 billion and $12.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, from $3.4 billion and $7.9 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. 

Net mortgage servicing revenue decreased $48 million and $62 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to increases in net negative valuation adjustments of $43 million and $63 million, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year also included the impact of a decrease in gross mortgage servicing fees of $5 million. Refer to Table 9 for the components of net valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio and the impact of the non-qualifying hedging strategy.

$ (83) (40) (171) (108) 

Mortgage rates decreased during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, which caused modeled prepayment speeds to rise. Additionally, swap rates increased for the three months ended September 30, 2020, which caused modeled OAS assumptions to increase. The fair value of the MSR portfolio increased $4 million and decreased $340 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to decreases of $120 million and $294 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, due to changes to inputs to the valuation model, including prepayment speeds and OAS assumptions. The fair value of the MSR portfolio decreased $75 million and $179 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $50 million and $122 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, due to the impact of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity. 

Further detail on the valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation of the MSR portfolio. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. 

In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp acquires various securities as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. The Bancorp recognized net losses of $1 million and net gains of $3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to net losses of an immaterial amount and net gains of $5 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, recorded in securities gains (losses), net &#8211; non-qualifying hedges on MSRs in the Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s total residential mortgage loans serviced as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 were $91.4 billion and $100.5 billion, respectively, with $73.5 billion and $82.7 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others. 

Card and processing revenue 

Card and processing revenue decreased $2 million and $6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by a decrease in customer spend volume, partially offset by lower reward costs and increases in other EFT income driven by the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition at the end of the first quarter of 2019. 

Leasing business revenue 

Leasing business revenue decreased $15 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in lease remarketing fees and operating lease income of $10 million and $5 million, respectively. Leasing business revenue increased $8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in lease syndication fees and operating lease income of $9 million and $7 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in lease remarketing fees of $6 million. The increase in operating lease income for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was driven by the acquisition of MB Financial, Inc. at the end of the first quarter of 2019.

Other noninterest income decreased $38 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in private equity investment income as well as increases in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares and the net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment. 

Private equity investment income decreased $18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the recognition of gains on certain private equity investments during the three months ended September 30, 2019. For additional information on the valuation of private equity investments, refer to Note 24 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp recognized negative valuation adjustments of $22 million related to the Visa total return swap during the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to negative valuation adjustments of $11 million during the three months ended September 30, 2019. For additional information on the valuation of the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares, refer to Note 24 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment increased $8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019 primarily driven by the impact of losses on the disposition of certain long-lived assets as well as impairment charges. For additional information on impairment of bank premises and equipment, refer to Note 8 and Note 24 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Other noninterest income decreased $637 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to the gain on sale of Worldpay, Inc. shares recognized during the first quarter of 2019 as well as a decrease in private equity investment income and an increase in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares. 

The Bancorp recognized a $562 million gain related to the sale of Worldpay, Inc. shares during the first quarter of 2019. Private equity investment income decreased $48 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by negative net valuation adjustments and impairment charges recognized on certain private equity investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to positive net valuation adjustments and gains on certain private equity investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. For additional information on the valuation of private equity investments, refer to Note 24 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp recognized negative valuation adjustments of $73 million related to the Visa total return swap during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to negative valuation adjustments of $63 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. For additional information on the valuation of the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares, refer to Note 24 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Noninterest Expense 

Noninterest expense increased $2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by decreases in other noninterest expense, marketing expense and technology and communications expense. Noninterest expense decreased $17 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in technology and communications expense and marketing expense, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits expense.

Technology and communications expense decreased $11 million and $47 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreased integration and conversion costs related to the acquisition of MB Financial, Inc. 

Marketing expense decreased $17 million and $43 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a pause or slowdown in numerous marketing campaigns, including running less advertising as well as the suspension of cash bonus and other account acquisition programs. 

Compensation and benefits expense increased $53 million and $68 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to strategic hiring and the impact of raising the Bancorp's minimum wage in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2020 also included an increase in severance expense of $18 million. Compensation and benefits expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 included zero and $10 million, respectively, of special payments to employees providing essential banking services through the COVID-19 pandemic. Full-time equivalent employees totaled 20,283 at September 30, 2020 compared to 19,478 at September 30, 2019.

Other noninterest expense decreased $20 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in travel expense and professional service fees, partially offset by an increase in FDIC insurance and other taxes. Travel expense decreased $14 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to reduced business travel as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Professional service fees decreased $7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in consulting fees and acquisition costs. FDIC insurance and other taxes increased $14 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in the assessment base. 

Other noninterest expense increased $1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in FDIC insurance and other taxes, loan and lease expense and losses and adjustments, partially offset by decreases in travel expenses and professional service fees. FDIC insurance and other taxes increased $26 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in the assessment base. Loan and lease expense increased $15 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in loan closing expenses. Losses and adjustments increased $13 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in credit valuation adjustments incurred during the first quarter of 2020 on derivatives associated with customer accommodation contracts, partially offset by a reduction in legal settlements expense. Travel expenses decreased $28 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to business travel being suspended for the second quarter of 2020 and reduced travel in the third quarter of 2020 as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Professional service fees decreased $20 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in consulting fees and acquisition costs. Additionally, other noninterest expense included $6 million of debt extinguishment costs associated with FHLB advances extinguished during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

Applicable Income Taxes 

The Bancorp&#8217;s income before income taxes, applicable income tax expense and effective tax rate are as follows: 

TABLE 14: Applicable Income Taxes For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, ($ in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Income before income taxes $ 746 &#160; 689 1,051 &#160; 2,261 Applicable income tax expense 165 &#160; 140 228 &#160; 483 Effective tax rate 22.1 &#160; &#160;% 20.2 21.6 &#160; 21.4 

Applicable income tax expense for all periods presented includes the benefit from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments and tax credits (and other related tax benefits), partially offset by the effect of proportional amortization of qualifying LIHTC investments and certain nondeductible expenses. The tax credits are primarily associated with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program established under Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC, the Rehabilitation Investment Tax 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC and the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program established under Section 1397E of the IRC. 

The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily related to the amount of income tax benefit recognized related to gains on sales of leases that are exempt from federal taxation for the three months ended September 30, 2019 as well as an increase in estimated state income tax expense and an increase in non-deductible expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2020. 

For stock-based awards, U.S. GAAP requires the tax consequences for the difference between the expense recognized for financial reporting and the Bancorp&#8217;s actual tax deduction for the stock-based awards be recognized through income tax expense in the interim periods in which they occur. The Bancorp cannot predict its stock price or whether and when its employees will exercise stock-based awards in the future. Based on its stock price at September 30, 2020, the Bancorp estimates it may be necessary to recognize $5 million of additional income tax expense over the next twelve months related to the settlement of stock-based awards primarily in the first half of 2021. However, the amount of income tax expense or benefit recognized upon settlement may vary significantly from expectations based on the Bancorp&#8217;s stock price and the number of SARs exercised by employees.

(a) Includes $5.2 billion, as of September 30, 2020, related to the SBA&#8217;s Paycheck Protection Program established under the CARES Act on March 27, 2020. 

(b) Includes $51 million, as of September 30, 2020, of residential mortgage loans previously sold to GNMA for which the Bancorp is deemed to have regained effective control over under ASC Topic 860, but did not exercise its option to repurchase. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 

Total loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale, increased $2.1 billion, or 2%, from December 31, 2019. The increase from December 31, 2019 was the result of a $1.2 billion, or 2%, increase in commercial loans and leases as well as an $881 million, or 2%, increase in consumer loans. 

Commercial loans and leases increased $1.2 billion from December 31, 2019 due to increases in commercial and industrial loans and commercial construction loans, partially offset by decreases in commercial leases and commercial mortgage loans. Commercial and industrial loans increased $1.1 billion, or 2%, from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of PPP loans originated during the second and third quarters of 2020. Commercial construction loans increased $566 million, or 11% from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of increased line of credit utilization as well as lower levels of payoffs. Commercial leases decreased $342 million, or 10% from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship-based lease originations. Commercial mortgage loans decreased $84 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2019 as payoffs exceeded loan originations. 

Consumer loans increased $881 million from December 31, 2019 due to increases in indirect secured consumer loans, residential mortgage loans and other consumer loans, partially offset by decreases in home equity and credit card. Indirect secured consumer loans increased $1.4 billion, or 12%, from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of loan production exceeding payoffs. Residential mortgage loans increased $434 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2019 primarily due to the repurchase of certain loans from GNMA that were in forbearance programs, partially offset by higher runoff due to payoffs exceeding loan originations. Other consumer loans increased $133 million, or 5%, from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of increases in loan originations. Home equity decreased $628 million, or 10%, from December 31, 2019 as payoffs exceeded loan originations. Credit card decreased $445 million, or 18%, from December 31, 2019 primarily due to negative economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, including reductions in the number of active accounts as well as purchase and balance activity per active account.

Average loans and leases, including average loans and leases held for sale, increased $3.9 billion, or 4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of a $2.7 billion, or 4%, increase in average commercial loans and leases as well as a $1.2 billion, or 3%, increase in average consumer loans. 

Average commercial loans and leases increased $2.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in average commercial and industrial loans, average commercial mortgage loans and average commercial construction loans, partially offset by a decrease in average commercial leases. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $2.7 billion, or 5%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the aforementioned increases in PPP loans. Average commercial mortgage loans increased $376 million, or 4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of increases in loan originations and permanent financing from the Bancorp&#8217;s commercial construction loan portfolio. Average commercial construction loans increased $267 million, or 5%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of increased line of credit utilization as well as lower levels of payoffs. Average commercial leases decreased $597 million, or 17%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship-based lease originations. 

Average consumer loans increased $1.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in average indirect secured consumer loans, average other consumer loans and average residential mortgage loans, partially offset by decreases in average home equity and average credit card. Average indirect secured consumer loans increased $1.9 billion, or 18%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to loan production exceeding payoffs. Average other consumer loans increased $236 million, or 9%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of increases in loan originations. Average residential mortgage loans increased $81 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the repurchase of certain loans from GNMA that were in forbearance programs, partially offset by higher runoff due to payoffs exceeding loan originations. Average home equity decreased $686 million, or 11%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year as payoffs exceeded loan originations. Average credit card decreased $314 million, or 13%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by the negative economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, including reductions in the number of active accounts as well as purchase and balance activity per active account. 

Investment Securities 

The Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing collateral for pledging purposes and for liquidity to satisfy regulatory requirements. Total investment securities were $38.4 billion and $36.9 billion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The taxable available-for-sale debt and other investment securities portfolio had an effective duration o f 4.6 years at September 30, 2020 compared to 5.1 years at December 31, 2019. 

Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in management&#8217;s judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. Securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities are classified as trading when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. At September 30, 2020, the Bancorp&#8217;s investment portfolio consisted primarily o f AAA-rated available-for-sale debt and other 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

securities. The Bancorp held an immaterial amount in below-investment grade available-for-sale debt and other securities at both September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Bancorp evaluates available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on such securities is a credit loss. If credit losses are identified, they are generally recognized as an allowance for credit losses (a contra account to the amortized cost basis of the securities) with the periodic change in the allowance recognized in earnings. Prior to January 1, 2020, investment securities were evaluated for OTTI with any identified OTTI recognized as a charge to income and a direct reduction of the amortized cost basis of the securities. 

At September 30, 2020, the Bancorp completed its evaluation of the available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position and did not recognize an allowance for credit losses. The Bancorp did not recognize provision expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 related to available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Bancorp recognized zero and $1 million, respectively, of OTTI on its available-for-sale debt and other securities, included in securities gains, net, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of investment securities: 

TABLE 17: Components of Investment Securities As of ($ in millions) September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Available-for-sale debt and other securities (amortized cost basis): U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities $ 75 &#160; 74 Obligations of states and political subdivisions securities 17 &#160; 18 Mortgage-backed securities: Agency residential mortgage-backed securities 11,711 &#160; 13,746 Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities 16,173 &#160; 15,141 Non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities 3,317 &#160; 3,242 Asset-backed securities and other debt securities 2,869 &#160; 2,189 Other securities (a)

(a) Other securities consist of FHLB, FRB and DTCC restricted stock holdings of $47, $482 and $2, respectively, at September 30, 2020 and $76, $478 and $2, respectively, at December 31, 2019, that are carried at cost. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities decreased $273 million from December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in agency residential mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by increases in agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities and other debt securities. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities were 19% and 24% of total interest-earning assets at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio was 6.1 years at September 30, 2020 compared to 6.6 years at December 31, 2019. In addition, at September 30, 2020, the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 3.09% compared to 3.22% at December 31, 2019. 

Information presented in Table 18 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is presented on an FTE basis and is computed using amortized cost balances and reflects the impact of prepayments. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio exclude other securities that have no stated yield or maturity. Total net unrealized gains on the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio were $2.7 billion at September 30, 2020 compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally increases when interest rates decrease or when credit spreads contract.

Other Short-Term Investments 

Other short-term investments primarily include overnight interest-earning investments, including reserves held at the FRB. The Bancorp uses other short-term investments as part of its liquidity risk management tools. Other short-term investments were $31.3 billion and $2.0 billion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase of $29.3 billion from December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to deposit growth and repayment of commercial customers&#8217; revolving line of credit draws from the first and second quarters of 2020. The Bank's commercial revolving line utilization at September 30, 2020 was 33%, compared to 38% at June 30, 2020 and 47% at March 31, 2020. 

Deposits 

The Bancorp&#8217;s deposit balances represent an important source of funding and revenue growth opportunity. The Bancorp continues to focus on core deposit growth in its retail and commercial franchises by improving customer satisfaction, building full relationships and offering competitive rates. Average core deposits represented 75% and 71% of the Bancorp&#8217;s average asset funding base at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.

(a) Includes $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion of institutional, retail and wholesale certificates $250,000 and over at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

Core deposits increased $30.0 billion, or 24%, from December 31, 2019 as a result of an increase in transaction deposits, partially offset by a decrease in other time deposits. Transaction deposits increased $31.9 billion, or 27%, from December 31, 2019 primarily due to increases in demand deposits, interest checking deposits, money market deposits and savings deposits. Demand deposits increased $15.9 billion, or 44%, and interest checking deposits increased $9.2 billion, or 23%, from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of higher balances per commercial customer account due to increased liquidity levels in the form of excess cash balances driven by the amount of fiscal stimulus during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Money market deposits increased $3.9 billion, or 14%, from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of higher balances per commercial customer account due to the previously mentioned increased liquidity levels in the current economic environment as well as higher demand for low-risk investment alternatives and decreased consumer spending amidst uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Savings deposits increased $3.0 billion, or 21%, from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of higher balances per customer account due to uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal stimulus as well as decreased consumer spending. Other time deposits decreased $1.9 billion, or 36%, from December 31, 2019 primarily due to lower offering rates on certificates less than $100,000. 

Certificates $100,000 and over decreased $391 million, or 11%, from December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in certificates of deposit issued since December 31, 2019 partially offset by an increase in retail brokered certificates of deposit issued since December 31, 2019. 

The following table presents the components of average deposits for the three months ended:

(a) Includes $2.6 billion of average institutional, retail and wholesale certificates $250,000 and over for both the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. 

On an average basis, core deposits increased $31.9 billion, or 27%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase of $34.0 billion, or 30%, in average transaction deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $2.1 billion, or 36%, in average other time deposits. The increase in average transaction deposits was driven primarily by increases in average demand deposits, average interest checking deposits, average money market deposits and average savings deposits. Average demand deposits increased $15.2 billion, or 43%, and average interest checking deposits increased $12.1 billion, or 32%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of higher average balances per commercial customer account due to the previously mentioned increased liquidity levels in the current economic environment. Average money market deposits 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

increased $4.2 billion, or 16%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of higher average balances per commercial customer account due to the previously mentioned increased liquidity levels in the current economic environment as well as higher demand for low-risk investment alternatives and decreased consumer spending amidst uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Average savings deposits increased $2.6 billion, or 18%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of higher average balances per customer account due to uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal stimulus as well as decreased consumer spending. Average other time deposits decreased primarily due to lower offering rates on certificates less than $100,000. 

Average certificates $100,000 and over decreased $1.2 billion, or 24%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in average certificates of deposit. 

Contractual maturities

Borrowings 

The Bancorp accesses a variety of short-term and long-term funding sources. Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term and include federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. Total average borrowings as a percent of average interest-bearing liabilities were 15% and 16% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of borrowings: 

TABLE 23: Components of Borrowings As of ($ in millions) September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Federal funds purchased $ 251 &#160; 260 Other short-term borrowings 1,196 &#160; 1,011 Long-term debt 15,123 &#160; 14,970 Total borrowings $ 16,570 &#160; 16,241 

Total borrowings increased $329 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2019 primarily due to increases in other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Other short-term borrowings increased $185 million from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of increases in securities sold under repurchase agreements driven by an increase in commercial customer activity and in interest-bearing obligations associated with collateral held for certain derivatives. The level of other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and the sources that are used to satisfy those needs. For further information on the components of other short-term borrowings, refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-term debt increased $153 million from December 31, 2019 primarily driven by the issuance of $1.25 billion of unsecured senior fixed-rate bank notes in January 2020, the issuance of $1.25 billion of unsecured senior fixed-rate notes in May 2020 and $186 million of fair value adjustments associated with interest rate swaps hedging long-term debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. These increases were partially offset by the maturity of $1.1 billion of 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

unsecured senior fixed-rate notes, the maturity of $750 million of unsecured senior fixed-rate bank notes, the maturity of $300 million of unsecured senior floating-rate bank notes and $444 million of paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

The following table summarizes components of average borrowings for the three months ended: 

TABLE 24: Components of Average Borrowings ($ in millions) September 30, 2020 September 30, 2019 Federal funds purchased $ 273 &#160; 739 Other short-term borrowings 1,626 &#160; 1,278 Long-term debt 16,230 &#160; 15,633 Total average borrowings $ 18,129 &#160; 17,650 

Total average borrowings increased $479 million, or 3%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in average long-term debt and average other short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in average federal funds purchased. Average long-term debt increased $597 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by the issuances of $1.25 billion of unsecured senior fixed-rate bank notes and $1.25 billion of unsecured senior fixed-rate notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and the issuance of $750 million of unsecured senior fixed-rate notes in the fourth quarter of 2019. These increases were partially offset by the maturity of $1.1 billion in unsecured senior fixed-rate notes, the maturity of $750 million in unsecured senior fixed-rate bank notes, the maturity of $250 million in unsecured senior floating-rate bank notes and $620 million of paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations since September of 2019. Average other short-term borrowings increased $348 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in obligations recognized by the Bancorp under ASC Topic 860 related to certain loans sold to GNMA and serviced by the Bancorp. For further information refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Average federal funds purchased decreased $466 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower short-term funding needs given core deposit growth. Information on the average rates paid on borrowings is discussed in the Net Interest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A. In addition, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for a discussion on the role of borrowings in the Bancorp&#8217;s liquidity management. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW 

The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Wealth and Asset Management. Additional information on each business segment is included in Note 25 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management&#8217;s accounting practices and businesses change. 

The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp&#8217;s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third&#8217;s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing. 

The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. In general, the charge rates on assets have declined since December 31, 2019 as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. The credit rates for deposit products also declined due to lower interest rates and modified assumptions. Thus, net interest income for asset-generating business segments improved while deposit-providing business segments were negatively impacted during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for allocating provision for credit losses expense to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. Provision for credit losses expense attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of cross-sell opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit. 

The following table summarizes net income (loss) by business segment:

(b) Applicable income tax expense for all periods includes the tax benefit from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments and tax credits partially offset by the effect of certain nondeductible expenses. Refer to the Applicable Income Taxes subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information. 

Net income was $12 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $393 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by an increase in provision for credit losses as well as decreases in net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expense. Net income was $249 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $1.1 billion for the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by an increase in provision for credit losses, a decrease in net interest income on an FTE basis as well as an increase in noninterest expense partially offset by an increase in noninterest income. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis decreased $192 million and $252 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in yields on average commercial loans and leases as well as decreases in FTP credit rates on demand deposits, interest checking deposits and savings and money market deposits. These negative impacts were partially offset by decreases in FTP charge rates on loans and leases as well as decreases in rates paid on average interest checking deposits and average savings and money market deposits. 

Provision for credit losses increased $283 million and $739 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in commercial criticized asset levels as well as increases in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans, commercial mortgage loans and commercial leases. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases increased to 35 bps for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 16 bps and 12 bps for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Noninterest income decreased $17 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in other noninterest income and leasing business revenue partially offset by an increase in service charges on deposits. Other noninterest income decreased $17 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by a decrease in private equity investment income, an increase in foreign exchange translation losses and a decrease in card and processing revenue. Leasing business revenue decreased $15 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in lease remarketing fees and operating lease income. Service charges on deposits increased $12 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by an increase in commercial deposit fees primarily due to lower earnings credit rates. Noninterest income increased $36 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by increases in commercial banking revenue, service charges on deposits and leasing business revenue partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest income. Commercial banking revenue increased $57 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in institutional sales and bridge fees partially offset by a decrease in loan syndication fees. Service charges on deposits increased $26 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in commercial deposit fees primarily due to lower earnings credit rates. Leasing business revenue increased $8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in lease syndication fees and operating lease income partially offset by a decrease in lease remarketing fees. Other noninterest income decreased $55 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by a decrease in private equity investment income, an increase in foreign exchange translation losses and a decrease in card and processing revenue. 

Noninterest expense decreased $14 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by decreases in other noninterest expense and leasing business expense partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits. Other noninterest expense decreased $18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in corporate overhead allocations, travel expense and losses and adjustments partially offset by an increase in FDIC insurance and other taxes. Leasing business expense decreased $5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in operating lease expense. Compensation and benefits increased $9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in base compensation and employee benefits expense partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation. Noninterest expense increased $96 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by increases in compensation and benefits, other noninterest expense and leasing business expense. Compensation and benefits increased $59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase in personnel costs primarily as a result of the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition at the end of the first quarter of 2019 as well as strategic hiring. Other noninterest expense increased $31 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in losses and adjustments, FDIC insurance and other taxes and corporate overhead allocations partially offset by a decrease in travel expense. Leasing business expense increased $6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in operating lease expense driven by the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition at the end of the first quarter of 2019. 

Average commercial loans and leases decreased $2.3 billion and increased $3.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was primarily driven by decreases in average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial leases partially offset by an increase in average commercial mortgage loans. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was primarily due to increases in average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial mortgage loans partially offset by a decrease in average commercial leases. Average commercial and industrial loans decreased $2.4 billion and increased $2.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was primarily driven by lower loan production as well as an increase in payoffs on revolving lines of credit. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was primarily driven by the MB Financial, Inc. acquisition at the end of the first quarter of 2019. Average commercial mortgage loans increased $407 million and $1.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of increases in loan originations and permanent financing from the Bancorp's commercial construction loan portfolio. Average commercial leases decreased $604 million and $568 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship-based lease originations. 

Average core deposits increased $20.3 billion and $15.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in average interest checking deposits, average demand deposits and average savings and money market deposits. Average interest checking deposits increased $9.2 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, average demand deposits increased $9.2 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively, and average savings and money market deposits increased $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in the prior year. These increases were primarily as a result of higher average balances per commercial customer account due to increased liquidity levels in the current economic environment.

Net income was $15 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to net income of $217 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in net interest income and noninterest income as well as an increase in provision for credit losses partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expense. Net income was $273 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to net income of $674 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net income was primarily due to decreases in net interest income and noninterest income as well as increases in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. 

Net interest income decreased $243 million and $430 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to decreases in FTP credit rates on core deposits and FTP credits on certificates $100,000 and over as well as decreases in yields on and average balances of home equity and credit card. These negative impacts were partially offset by decreases in the rates paid on average savings and money market deposits and decreases in the rates paid on and average balances of other time deposits and certificates $100,000 and over as well as decreases in FTP charge rates on loans and leases. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was also partially offset by an increase in average other consumer loans. 

Provision for credit losses increased $10 million and $18 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to an increase in commercial criticized asset levels partially offset by decreases in net charge-offs on other consumer loans, credit card and home equity. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 113 bps and 133 bps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to 149 bps and 143 bps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. 

Noninterest income decreased $12 million and $35 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in service charges on deposits and other noninterest income partially offset by increases in wealth and asset management revenue.

Average consumer loans decreased $630 million and $264 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in average home equity of $630 million and $465 million, respectively, as payoffs exceeded loan originations. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2020 also included a decrease in average credit card of $311 million driven by the negative economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, including reductions in the number of active accounts as well as purchase and balance activity per active account. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was partially offset by an increase in average residential mortgage loans of $268 million primarily due to loan production exceeding payoffs. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was partially offset by an increase in average other consumer loans of $248 million primarily as a result of increases in loan originations. 

Average deposits increased $8.0 billion and $7.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average savings and money market deposits, average demand deposits and average interest checking deposits partially offset by decreases in average other time deposits and certificates $100,000 and over. Average savings and money market deposits increased $4.2 billion and $3.6 billion and average demand deposits increased $5.1 billion and $3.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of higher balances per customer account due to uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal stimulus as well as decreased consumer spending. Average interest checking deposits increased $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of higher balance per customer account, fiscal stimulus as well as decreased consumer spending. Average other time deposits and certificates $100,000 and over decreased $3.3 billion and $1.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to lower offering rates on certificates less than $100,000 as well as decreases in average certificates $100,000 and over for the three months ended September 30, 2020.

OREO expense. Compensation and benefits increased $9 million and $16 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in incentive compensation and base compensation resulting from the increased mortgage origination activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

Average consumer loans increased $1.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in average indirect secured consumer loans partially offset by a decrease in average residential mortgage loans.

Net interest income decreased $16 million and $25 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in FTP credit rates on interest checking deposits, savings and money market deposits and demand deposits as well as decreases in yields on average loans and leases. These negative impacts were partially offset by decreases in the rates paid on average interest checking deposits and average savings and money market deposits as well as decreases in FTP charge rates on loans and leases. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Noninterest income increased $7 million and $31 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in wealth and asset management revenue. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 also included an increase in other noninterest income. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $7 million and $26 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of increases in broker income, private client service fees and institutional fees. Other noninterest income increased $5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a loss on sale of a business recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

Noninterest expense increased $4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase in compensation and benefits primarily driven by increases in incentive compensation and deferred compensation expense. Noninterest expense increased $3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by an increase in other noninterest expense primarily due to an increase in corporate overhead allocations partially offset by a decrease in travel expense. 

Average loans and leases, including held for sale, increased $42 million and $52 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average residential mortgage loans and average other consumer loans as a result of higher loan production partially offset by decreases in average commercial and industrial loans as payoffs exceeded new loan production. 

Average core deposits increased $1.3 billion for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increases in average interest checking deposits and average savings and money market deposits as a result of higher balances per customer account due to the current economic environment. 

General Corporate and Other 

General Corporate and Other includes the unallocated portion of the investment securities portfolio, securities gains and losses, certain non-core deposit funding, unassigned equity, unallocated provision for credit losses expense or a benefit from the reduction of the ACL, the payment of preferred stock dividends and certain support activities and other items not attributed to the business segments. 

Net interest income increased $368 million and $690 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases were primarily driven by decreases in FTP credit rates on deposits allocated to the business segments, increases in interest income on loans and leases and decreases in interest expense on long-term debt, federal funds purchased, deposits and other short-term borrowings. These positive impacts were partially offset by decreases in the benefit related to FTP charge rates on loans and leases and decreases in interest income on taxable securities. 

The benefit from credit losses was $422 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to provision for credit losses of $8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. Provision for credit losses was $64 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to provision for credit losses of $12 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by an increase in the allocation of provision expense to the business segments due to an increase in commercial criticized asset levels as well as a decrease in the ACL from the second quarter of 2020, which was driven by improved economic forecasts, improved consumer credit quality and lower period-end loan and lease balances. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the ACL reflecting deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, continued pressure on energy prices and the resulting impact of this environment on commercial borrowers. The increase was partially offset by an increase in the allocation of provision expense to the business segments driven by an increase in commercial criticized asset levels. The change in provision for credit losses for both periods also reflected the impact of the change in methodology for estimating credit losses from the incurred loss methodology to the expected credit loss methodology beginning in the first quarter of 2020. 

Noninterest income increased $29 million and decreased $555 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by the recognition of securities gains of $51 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to securities gains of $5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was partially offset by an increase in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares and a decrease in private equity investment income. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to the recognition of a $562 million gain related to the sale of Worldpay, Inc. shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease was also driven by a decrease in private equity investment income and an increase in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares. These negative impacts were partially offset by the recognition of securities gains of $48 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to securities gains of $30 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

RISK MANAGEMENT &#8211; OVERVIEW 

Effective risk management is critical to the Bancorp&#8217;s ongoing success and ensures that the Bancorp operates in a safe and sound manner, complies with applicable laws and regulations and safeguards the Bancorp&#8217;s brand and reputation. Risks are inherent in the Bancorp&#8217;s business, and the Bancorp is responsible for managing these risks effectively to deliver through-the-cycle value and performance for the Bancorp&#8217;s shareholders, customers, employees and communities. 

Fifth Third&#8217;s Risk Management Framework, which is approved annually by the ERMC, RCC and the Board of Directors, includes the following key elements: 

&#8226; The Bancorp ensures transparency and escalation of risk through defined risk policies and a governance structure that includes the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors, the Enterprise Risk Management Committee and other management-level risk committees and councils. 

&#8226; The Bancorp establishes a risk appetite in alignment with its strategic, financial and capital plans. The Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite is defined using quantitative metrics and qualitative measures to ensure prudent risk taking and drive balanced decision making. The Bancorp&#8217;s goal is to ensure that aggregate residual risks do not exceed the Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite, and that risks taken are supportive of the Bancorp&#8217;s portfolio diversification and profitability objectives. The Board and executive management define the risk appetite, which is considered in the development of business strategies and forms the basis for risk management. 

&#8226; The core principles that define the Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite are as follows: 

&#9702; To act with integrity in all activities. 

&#9702; To understand the risks taken and ensure that they are in alignment with the Bancorp&#8217;s business strategies and risk appetite. 

&#9702; To avoid risks that cannot be understood, managed or monitored. 

&#9702; To provide transparency of risk to the Bancorp&#8217;s management and Board by escalating risks and issues as necessary. 

&#9702; To ensure Fifth Third&#8217;s products and services are aligned to the Bancorp&#8217;s core customer base and are designed, delivered and maintained to provide value and benefit to the Bancorp&#8217;s customers and to Fifth Third. 

&#9702; Not to offer products or services that are not appropriate or suitable for the Bancorp&#8217;s customers. 

&#9702; Focus on providing operational excellence by providing reliable, accurate, and efficient services to meet the Bancorp&#8217;s customers&#8217; needs. 

&#9702; To maintain a strong financial position to ensure the Bancorp meets its strategic objectives through all economic cycles and is able to access the capital markets at all times, even under stressed conditions. 

&#9702; To protect the Bancorp&#8217;s reputation by thoroughly understanding the consequences of business strategies, products and processes. 

&#9702; To conduct the Bancorp&#8217;s business in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and in alignment with internal policies and procedures. 

&#8226; Fifth Third&#8217;s core values and culture provide the foundation for sound risk management practices by establishing expectations for appropriate conduct and accountability across the organization. All employees are expected to conduct themselves in alignment with Fifth Third&#8217;s Code of Business Conduct &#38; Ethics, which may be found on www.53.com, while carrying out their responsibilities. Fifth Third&#8217;s Corporate Responsibility and Reputation Committee provides oversight of business conduct policies, programs and strategies, and monitors reporting of potential misconduct, trends or themes across the enterprise. Prudent risk management is a responsibility that is expected from all employees across the first, second and third lines of defense and is a foundational element of Fifth Third&#8217;s culture. 

&#8226; The Bancorp manages eight defined risk types to a prescribed appetite. The risk types are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, price risk, legal and regulatory compliance risk, operational risk, reputational risk and strategic risk. 

&#8226; Fifth Third&#8217;s Risk Management Process provides a consistent and integrated approach for managing risks. The five components of the Risk Management Process are: identify, assess, manage, monitor and report. The Bancorp has also established processes and programs to manage and report concentration risks, to ensure robust talent, compensation and performance management and to aggregate risks across the enterprise. 

Fifth Third drives accountability for managing risk through its Three Lines of Defense structure: 

&#8226; The first line of defense is comprised of front line units that create risk and are accountable for managing risk. These groups are the Bancorp&#8217;s primary risk takers and are responsible for implementing effective internal controls and maintaining processes for identifying, assessing, controlling and mitigating the risks associated with their activities consistent with established risk appetite and limits. The first line of defense also includes business units that provide information technology, operations, servicing, processing or other support. 

&#8226; The second line of defense, or Independent Risk Management, consists of Risk Management, Compliance and Credit Review. The second line is responsible for developing frameworks and policies to govern risk-taking activities, overseeing risk-taking of the organization, advising on controlling that risk and providing input on key risk decisions. Risk Management complements the front line&#8217;s management of risk-taking activities through its monitoring and reporting responsibilities, including adherence to the risk appetite. Additionally, Risk Management is responsible for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling aggregate risks enterprise-wide. 

&#8226; The third line of defense is Internal Audit, which provides oversight of the first and second lines of defense, and independent assurance to the Board on the effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal controls.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT 

The objective of the Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the Bancorp. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. The Bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices which are described below. These practices include the use of intentional risk-based limits for single name exposures and counterparty selection criteria designed to reduce or eliminate exposure to borrowers who have higher than average default risk and defined weaknesses in financial performance. The Bancorp carefully designed and monitors underwriting, documentation and collection standards. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Credit officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority amounts, the utilization of which is closely monitored. Underwriting activities are centrally managed, and ERM manages the policy and the authority delegation process directly. The Credit Risk Review function provides independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk grades and the charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on quarterly assessments of the estimated losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp uses these assessments to promptly identify potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio, maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses and record any necessary charge-offs. The Bancorp defines potential problem loans and leases as those rated substandard that do not meet the definition of a nonaccrual loan or a restructured loan. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s credit grade categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions. In addition, stress testing is performed on various commercial and consumer portfolios utilizing various models. For certain portfolios, such as real estate and leveraged lending, stress testing is performed by Credit department personnel at the individual loan level during credit underwriting. 

The following tables provide a summary of potential problem portfolio loans and leases: 

TABLE 30: Potential Problem Portfolio Loans and Leases As of September 30, 2020 ($ in millions) Carrying Value Unpaid Principal Balance Exposure Commercial and industrial loans $ 2,823 &#160; 2,834 &#160; 3,792 &#160; Commercial mortgage loans 685 &#160; 705 &#160; 690 &#160; Commercial construction loans 57 &#160; 57 &#160; 69 &#160; Commercial leases 87 &#160; 87 &#160; 87 &#160; Total potential problem portfolio loans and leases $ 3,652 &#160; 3,683 &#160; 4,638 &#160; TABLE 31: Potential Problem Portfolio Loans and Leases As of December 31, 2019 ($ in millions) Carrying Value Unpaid Principal Balance Exposure Commercial and industrial loans $ 1,100 1,120 1,488 Commercial mortgage loans 342 390 342 Commercial construction loans 75 82 84 Commercial leases 61 61 61 Total potential problem portfolio loans and leases $ 1,578 1,653 1,975 

In addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems. The first of these risk grading systems encompasses ten categories, which are based on regulatory guidance for credit risk systems. These ratings are used by the Bancorp to monitor and manage its credit risk. The Bancorp also maintains a dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing, portfolio monitoring and capital allocation that includes a &#8220;through-the-cycle&#8221; rating philosophy for assessing a borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness. A &#8220;through-the-cycle&#8221; rating philosophy uses a grading scale that assigns ratings based on average default rates through an entire business cycle for borrowers with similar financial performance. The dual risk rating system includes thirteen probabilities of default grade categories and an additional eleven grade categories for estimating losses given an event of default. The probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the ten-category regulatory risk rating system. 

The Bancorp has also developed models to estimate expected credit losses as part of the Bancorp&#8217;s adoption of ASU 2016-13 &#8220; Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments &#8221; on January 1, 2020. For loans and leases that are collectively evaluated, the Bancorp utilizes these models to forecast expected credit losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Bancorp&#8217;s processes for developing these models, 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

estimating credit losses for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period and for estimating credit losses for individually evaluated loans. 

For the commercial portfolio segment, the estimated probabilities of default are primarily based on the probability of default ratings assigned under the through-the-cycle dual risk rating system and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. 

For collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower&#8217;s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as credit card and home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The Bancorp also utilizes various scoring systems, analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring processes to assess the credit risk of the consumer and residential mortgage portfolios. 

Overview 

U.S. economic growth accelerated in the third quarter of 2020 as unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy accommodation continued to support risk assets and economic activity. These policies, along with an easing of government restrictions on activity, supported a robust recovery with real GDP increasing an annualized 33% during the third quarter of 2020. With investors expecting a sustained period of low interest rates, credit spreads continued to tighten as strong demand for duration and yield drove credit markets while the S&#38;P 500 increased 8.5% during the third quarter of 2020 on the back of better than expected second quarter earnings. Financial market volatility increased in September of 2020 as investors contemplated an uncertain election outcome and the on-again off-again fiscal negotiations. At this point it appears unlikely Congress will agree to a new stimulus package this year and the outcome of the election will determine the path forward for fiscal policy. Meanwhile, COVID-19 rates of infection have begun to increase as temperatures turn cooler and people move indoors while the path to a vaccine remains uncertain at this time. 

With this backdrop, policymakers are committed to providing additional accommodation to ensure a robust recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. budget deficit increased to $3.1 trillion for fiscal year 2020, relative to the size of the economy the deficit was 15% of GDP, the largest since 1945. At the annual Kansas City Fed Economic Policy Symposium, the FOMC adopted a new monetary policy framework with an emphasis on maximizing employment and a flexible average inflation target. &#8220;The Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.&#8221; With the announcement, the FOMC officially ended the policy of preemptively hiking rates to avoid an uptick in inflation as the economy recovers. The FOMC also continued its policy of increasing holdings of treasury securities by $80 billion per month and agency mortgage-backed securities holdings by $40 billion per month. Since the end of February 2020, the Federal Reserve balance sheet has expanded $3 trillion to $7.2 trillion, or 34%, of U.S. GDP. 

COVID-19 Hardship Relief Programs 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in March 2020, the Bancorp began providing financial hardship relief to borrowers that were negatively impacted by the pandemic and its related economic impacts. For retail borrowers, these relief programs included three-month payment deferrals for non-real estate secured and unsecured portfolios, six-month payment deferrals for home equity loans and lines of credit and six-month forbearances for residential mortgages. The Bancorp also temporarily waived fees for certain products and services, suspended initiating any new repossession actions on vehicles and suspended all residential foreclosure activity. The fee waiver, repossession suspension and payment deferral programs for non-real estate secured and unsecured and home equity loans and lines of credit were discontinued early in the third quarter of 2020. However, new programs to assist consumer customers are now being offered to meet the uniqueness of the current economic environment. These primarily include a short-term hardship program which allows for a reduced payment amount for six months with full payments resuming thereafter or placement into a loan modification program that could include permanent rate reductions or maturity extensions. 

The Bancorp will continue to offer the six-month forbearance program for its residential mortgage borrowers until the end of 2020. Upon completion of the initial six-month forbearance period for residential mortgage loans, borrowers may request to extend the forbearance period for an additional period of up to six months. Additionally, the Bancorp will continue to follow the specific GSE guidance for other non-forbearance related COVID-19 pandemic relief programs when servicing its residential mortgage portfolio. These programs include 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

traditional loan modifications and/or deferral of past due payments to the maturity of the loan. The Bancorp has also extended its suspension of residential foreclosure activity through at least December 31, 2020, in alignment with GSE practices. 

The Bancorp has also offered a variety of relief options to its commercial borrowers that have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While these offers are individually negotiated and tailored to each borrower&#8217;s specific facts and circumstances, the most commonly offered relief measures include temporary covenant waivers and/or deferrals of principal and/or interest payments for up to 90 days. After the deferral program, a customer may have the option to resume normal payments, enter into a formal loan modification program or restructure the loan arrangement. 

Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of loans and leases that received payment deferrals or forbearances, as of September 30, 2020, under Fifth Third&#8217;s hardship relief programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Commercial Portfolio 

The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy seeks to minimize concentrations of risk through diversification. The Bancorp has commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of business within the commercial segment, geography and credit product type. The risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and continuous portfolio risk management reporting. 

The Bancorp provides loans to a variety of customers ranging from large multinational firms to middle market businesses, sole proprietors and high net worth individuals. The origination policies for commercial and industrial loans outline the risks and underwriting requirements for loans to businesses in various industries. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, collateral and leverage requirements, cash flow coverage measures and hold limits. The Bancorp aligns credit and sales teams with specific industry expertise to better monitor and manage different industry segments of the portfolio. 

Certain industries have experienced increased stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The following table presents industries impacted the most severely within the Bancorp&#8217;s commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loan portfolios as of September 30, 2020:

The origination policies for commercial real estate outline the risks and underwriting requirements for owner and nonowner-occupied and construction lending. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, maximum LTVs, minimum debt service coverage ratios, construction loan monitoring procedures, appraisal requirements, pre-leasing requirements (as applicable), pro forma analysis requirements and interest rate sensitivity. The Bancorp requires a valuation of real estate collateral, which may include third-party appraisals, be performed at the time of origination and renewal in accordance with regulatory requirements and on an as-needed basis when market conditions justify. Although the Bancorp does not back test these collateral value assumptions, the Bancorp maintains an appraisal review department to order and review third-party appraisals in accordance with regulatory requirements. Collateral values on criticized assets with relationships exceeding $1 million are reviewed quarterly to assess the appropriateness of the value ascribed in the assessment of charge-offs and specific reserves. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

Consumer Portfolio 

Consumer credit risk management utilizes a framework that encompasses consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting credit risk. These processes are supported by a credit risk governance structure that includes Board oversight, policies, risk limits and risk committees. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s consumer portfolio is materially comprised of five categories of loans: residential mortgage loans, home equity, indirect secured consumer loans, credit card and other consumer loans. The Bancorp has identified certain credit characteristics within these five categories of loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio. The Bancorp does not update LTVs for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except as part of the charge-off process for real estate secured loans. Credit risk management continues to closely monitor the indirect secured consumer portfolio performance, which includes automobile loans. The automobile market has exhibited industry-wide gradual loosening of credit standards such as lower FICOs, longer terms and higher LTVs. The Bancorp has adjusted credit standards focused on improving risk-adjusted returns while maintaining credit risk tolerance. The Bancorp actively manages the automobile portfolio through concentration limits, which mitigate credit risk through limiting the exposure to lower FICO scores, higher advance rates and extended term originations. 

Residential mortgage portfolio 

The Bancorp manages credit risk in the residential mortgage portfolio through underwriting guidelines that limit exposure to higher LTVs and lower FICO scores. Additionally, the portfolio is governed by concentration limits that ensure geographic, product and channel diversification. The Bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio. 

The Bancorp does not originate residential mortgage loans that permit customers to defer principal payments or make payments that are less than the accruing interest. The Bancorp originates both fixed-rate and ARM loans. Within the ARM portfolio, approximately $563 million of ARM loans will have rate resets during the next twelve months. Of these resets, 4% are expected to experience an increase in rate, with an average increase of approximately 0.40%. Underlying characteristics of these borrowers are relatively strong with a weighted average origination DTI of 31% and weighted average origination LTV of 71%. 

Certain residential mortgage products have contractual features that may increase credit exposure to the Bancorp in the event of a decline in housing values. These types of mortgage products offered by the Bancorp include loans with high LTVs, multiple loans secured by the same collateral that when combined result in an LTV greater than 80% and interest-only loans. The Bancorp has deemed residential mortgage loans with greater than 80% LTVs and no mortgage insurance as loans that represent a higher level of risk. 

Portfolio residential mortgage loans from 2010 and later vintages represented 94% of the portfolio as of September 30, 2020 and had a weighted-average origination LTV of 73% and a weighted-average origination FICO of 761. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bancorp has provided forbearances for up to six months for customers who are experiencing a hardship related to COVID-19, with an option for borrowers to extend the forbearance period for an additional period of up to six months upon request. Additionally, the Bancorp has introduced revised credit underwriting guidelines for new originations, raising the minimum FICO score at origination to 680 and lowering the maximum allowable LTV to 80%. For further information on reporting of past due loans, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Home equity portfolio 

The Bancorp&#8217;s home equity portfolio is primarily comprised of home equity lines of credit. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, the Bancorp&#8217;s newly originated home equity lines of credit have a 10-year interest-only draw period followed by a 20-year amortization period. The home equity line of credit previously offered by the Bancorp was a revolving facility with a 20-year term, minimum payments of interest-only and a balloon payment of principal at maturity. Peak maturity years for the balloon home equity lines of credit are 2025 to 2028 and approximately 23% of the balances mature before 2025. 

The ALLL provides coverage for expected losses in the home equity portfolio. The allowance attributable to the portion of the home equity portfolio that has not been restructured in a TDR is determined on a pooled basis using a probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default model framework to generate expected losses. The expected losses for the home equity portfolio are dependent upon loan delinquency, FICO scores, LTV, loan age and their historical correlation with macroeconomic variables including unemployment and the home price index. The expected losses generated from models are adjusted by certain qualitative adjustment factors to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends. The qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The home equity portfolio is managed in two primary groups: loans outstanding with a combined LTV greater than 80% and those loans with an LTV of 80% or less based upon appraisals at origination. For additional information on these loans, refer to Table 42 and Table 43. Of the total $5.5 billion of outstanding home equity loans: 

&#9679; 91% reside within the Bancorp&#8217;s Midwest footprint of Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois as of September 30, 2020; 

&#9679; 38% are in senior lien positions and 62% are in junior lien positions at September 30, 2020; 

&#9679; 79% of non-delinquent borrowers made at least one payment greater than the minimum payment during the three months ended September 30, 2020; and 

&#9679; The portfolio had a weighted average refreshed FICO score of 747 at September 30, 2020. 

The Bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes adjustments in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Bancorp does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTVs after origination. However, the Bancorp monitors the local housing markets by reviewing various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring processes. For junior lien home equity loans which become 60 days or more past due, the Bancorp tracks the performance of the senior lien loans in which the Bancorp is the servicer and utilizes consumer credit bureau attributes to monitor the status of the senior lien loans that the Bancorp does not service. If the senior lien loan is found to be 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status unless both loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, if the junior lien home equity loan becomes 120 days or more past due and the senior lien loan is also 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is assessed for charge-off. Refer to the Analysis of Nonperforming Assets subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for more information. 

The Bancorp has also introduced revised credit underwriting guidelines on new home equity originations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, raising the minimum FICO score at origination to 720, lowering the maximum LTV to 80% and instituting more stringent verification of employment requirements. Additionally, applicants must have a Fifth Third deposit relationship to be considered for approval.

Indirect secured consumer portfolio 

The indirect secured consumer portfolio is comprised of $11.9 billion of automobile loans and $1 billion of indirect motorcycle, powersport, recreational vehicle and marine loans as of September 30, 2020. The concentration of lower FICO (&#8804;659) origination balances remained within targeted credit risk tolerance during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. All concentration and guideline changes are monitored monthly to ensure alignment with original credit performance and return projections. 

The following table provides an analysis of indirect secured consumer portfolio loans outstanding disaggregated based upon FICO score at origination as of:

As of September 30, 2020, 94% of the indirect secured consumer loan portfolio is comprised of automobile loans, powersport loans and motorcycle loans. It is a common industry practice to advance on these types of loans an amount in excess of the collateral value due to the inclusion of negative equity trade-in, maintenance/warranty products, taxes, title and other fees paid at closing. The Bancorp monitors its exposure to these higher risk loans. The remainder of the indirect secured consumer loan portfolio is comprised of marine and recreational vehicle loans. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit policies limit the maximum advance rate on these to 100% of collateral value. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the indirect automobile originations credit underwriting guidelines have been revised. Revisions include lowering maximum advance rates to 110%, raising the minimum FICO score at origination to 650, raising internal score cutoffs and

tightening capacity to repay standards. Revised credit underwriting guidelines have also been implemented in the marine, recreational vehicle and powersport channels, raising the minimum FICO score at origination and reducing the maximum allowable advance.

Credit card portfolio 

The credit card portfolio consists of predominantly prime accounts with 97% of balances existing within the Bancorp&#8217;s footprint at both September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, 68% and 67%, respectively, of the outstanding balances were originated through branch-based relationships with the remainder coming from direct mail campaigns and online acquisitions. 

Card origination strategies have also been revised in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The minimum FICO score at origination was raised to 720 with a qualifying Fifth Third deposit relationship requirement. New customer prospect marketing has also been halted. 

The following table provides an analysis of credit card portfolio loans outstanding disaggregated based upon FICO score at origination as of:

Other consumer portfolio loans 

Other consumer portfolio loans are comprised of secured and unsecured loans originated through the Bancorp&#8217;s branch network as well as point-of-sale loans originated in connection with third-party financial technology companies. The Bancorp had $229 million in unfunded commitments associated with loans originated in connection with third-party financial technology companies as of September 30, 2020. The Bancorp closely monitors the credit performance of point-of-sale loans which, for the Bancorp, is impacted by the credit loss protection coverage provided by the third-party financial technology companies. 

Minimum FICO scores at origination for unsecured loans originated through Fifth Third and third parties have been raised to 720 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, for Fifth Third originated unsecured loans, a qualifying Fifth Third deposit relationship is now required.

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal and/or interest is uncertain; restructured commercial, credit card and certain consumer loans which have not yet met the requirements to be classified as a performing asset; restructured consumer loans which are 90 days past due based on the restructured terms unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection; and certain other assets, including OREO and other repossessed property. A summary of nonperforming assets is included in Table 50. For further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s policies related to accounting for delinquent and nonperforming loans and leases, refer to the Nonaccrual Loans and Leases section of Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Nonperforming assets were $942 million at September 30, 2020 compared to $687 million at December 31, 2019. At September 30, 2020, $11 million of nonaccrual loans were held for sale, compared to $7 million at December 31, 2019. 

Nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO were 0.84% as of September 30, 2020 compared to 0.62% as of December 31, 2019. Nonaccrual loans and leases secured by real estate were 36% o f nonaccrual loans and leases as of September 30, 2020 compared to 35% as of December 31, 2019. 

Portfolio commercial nonaccrual loans and leases were $688 million at September 30, 2020, an increase of $291 million from December 31, 2019. Portfolio consumer nonaccrual loans were $203 million at September 30, 2020, a decrease of $18 million from December 31, 2019. Refer to Table 51 for a rollforward of the portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases. 

OREO and other repossessed property was $40 million and $62 million at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The Bancorp recognized $2 million in losses on the transfer, sale or write-down of OREO properties for both the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $7 million and $5 million in losses on the transfer, sale or write-down of OREO properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 approximately $10 million and $27 million, respectively, of interest income would have been recognized if the nonaccrual and renegotiated loans and leases on nonaccrual status had been current in accordance with their original terms. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 approximately $9 million and $26 million, respectively, of interest income would have been recognized. Although these values help demonstrate the costs of carrying nonaccrual credits, the Bancorp does not expect to recover the full amount of interest as nonaccrual loans and leases are generally carried below their principal balance.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

A loan is accounted for as a TDR if the Bancorp, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. TDRs include concessions granted under reorganization, arrangement or other provisions of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. A TDR typically involves a modification of terms such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or remaining principal amount of the loan, a reduction of accrued interest or an extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk. 

At the time of modification, the Bancorp maintains certain consumer loan TDRs (including certain residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and other consumer loans) on accrual status, provided there is reasonable assurance of repayment and performance according to the modified terms based upon a current, well-documented credit evaluation. Loans discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as collateral-dependent TDRs and placed on nonaccrual status regardless of the borrower&#8217;s payment history or capacity to repay in the future. These loans are returned to accrual status provided there is a sustained payment history of twelve months after bankruptcy and collectability is reasonably assured for all remaining contractual payments. Commercial loans modified as part of a TDR are maintained on accrual status provided there is a sustained payment history of six months or greater prior to the modification in accordance with the modified terms and all remaining contractual payments under the modified terms are reasonably assured of collection.

Analysis of Net Loan Charge-offs 

Net charge-offs were 35 bps and 36 bps of average portfolio loans and leases for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were 41 bps and 32 bps of average portfolio loans and leases for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Table 55 provides a summary of credit loss experience and net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases outstanding by loan category. 

The ratio of commercial loan and lease net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio commercial loans and leases increased to 33 bps and 35 bps during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to 18 bps and 14 bps during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. The increases for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 were primarily due to increases in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans of $13 million and $90 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. 

The ratio of consumer loan net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio consumer loans decreased to 40 bps and 53 bps during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to 68 bps and 65 bps during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. The decreases for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 were primarily due to decreases in net charge-offs on indirect secured consumer loans of $10 million and $11 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, and decreases in net charge-offs on other consumer loans of $9 million and $10 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decreases for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 included the impact of government stimulus programs and the Bancorp's hardship programs.
