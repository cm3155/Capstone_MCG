 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 2) 

The following is Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of certain significant factors that have affected Fifth Third Bancorp&#8217;s (the &#8220;Bancorp&#8221; or &#8220;Fifth Third&#8221;) financial condition and results of operations during the periods included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which are a part of this filing. Reference to the Bancorp incorporates the parent holding company and all consolidated subsidiaries. The Bancorp&#8217;s banking subsidiary is referred to as the Bank. 

OVERVIEW 

Fifth Third Bancorp is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. At March 31, 2023, the Bancorp had $209 billion in assets and operated 1,069 full-service banking centers and 2,118 Fifth Third branded ATMs in eleven states throughout the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the U.S. The Bancorp reports on three business segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Small Business Banking and Wealth and Asset Management. 

This overview of MD&#38;A highlights selected information in the financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document as well as the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorp&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, refer to the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool for the reader of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD&#38;A, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Net interest income, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD&#38;A on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. The FTE basis for presenting net interest income is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&#38;A. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 69% and 31% of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers domiciled in the U.S. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A, risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the Bancorp. 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral. 

Noninterest income is derived from commercial banking revenue, wealth and asset management revenue, service charges on deposits, card and processing revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, leasing business revenue, other noninterest income and net securities gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes compensation and benefits, technology and communications, net occupancy expense, equipment expense, leasing business expense, marketing expense, card and processing expense and other noninterest expense. 

Current Economic Conditions 

Economic activity expanded at a modest pace in the first quarter of 2023. The labor market has remained strong and inflation has remained elevated. In response to persistent inflationary pressures, the FRB has raised benchmark interest rates by 500 basis points since March 2022 and has signaled they will continue to monitor the cumulative economic effects of their policy actions, including tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, when determining future monetary actions. Amidst the rapid rate increases, several financial markets have experienced heightened volatility. 

Changes in interest rates can affect numerous aspects of the Bancorp&#8217;s business and may impact the Bancorp&#8217;s future performance. If financial markets remain volatile, this may impact the future performance of various segments of the Bancorp&#8217;s business, including the value 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

of the Bancorp&#8217;s investment securities portfolio. The Bancorp continues to closely monitor the pace of inflation and the impacts of inflation on the broader market. 

The recent high-profile bank failures involving Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank have generated significant market volatility and have increased regulatory and market focus on the liquidity, asset-liability management and unrealized securities losses of banks. In March 2023, the FRB started the Bank Term Funding Program, which makes additional funding available to eligible depository institutions. The Bancorp continues to monitor regulatory changes related to these developments. 

For further discussion on current economic conditions, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A. Additionally, refer to the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for additional information about the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management activities. 

Accelerated Share Repurchase Transaction 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Bancorp entered into and settled an accelerated share repurchase transaction. As part of the transaction, the Bancorp entered into a forward contract in which the final number of shares delivered at settlement was based generally on a discount to the average daily volume weighted-average price of the Bancorp&#8217;s common stock during the term of the repurchase agreement. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on share repurchase activity. 

LIBOR Transition 

In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the &#8220;FCA&#8221;), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA would stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. Since then, central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for LIBOR. 

On March 5, 2021, the FCA and ICE Benchmark Administration, Limited announced that the publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR maturities and non-USD LIBOR maturities would cease immediately after December 31, 2021, with the remaining USD LIBOR maturities ceasing immediately after June 30, 2023. In the United States, the Alternative Rates Reference Committee (the &#8220;ARRC&#8221;), a group of market participants convened in 2014 to help ensure a successful transition away from USD LIBOR, identified SOFR as its preferred alternative rate. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. The composition and characteristics of SOFR are not the same as those of LIBOR, and SOFR is fundamentally different from LIBOR for two key reasons: (1) SOFR is a secured rate, while LIBOR is an unsecured rate, and (2) SOFR is an overnight rate, while LIBOR is a forward-looking rate that represents interbank funding over different maturities. As a result, there can be no assurance that SOFR, however calculated, will perform the same way as LIBOR would have at any time, including, as a result of changes in interest and yield rates in the market, market volatility, or global or regional economic, financial, political, regulatory, judicial or other events. 

On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the &#8220;LIBOR Act&#8221;) into law. The LIBOR Act offers a federal solution for transitioning legacy instruments that lack sufficient provisions addressing LIBOR&#8217;s cessation by outlining a uniform process to govern the transition from LIBOR to a replacement rate. The LIBOR Act also establishes a safe harbor for lenders, shielding lenders from litigation as a result of their choice of a replacement rate (such as SOFR) per FRB recommendations. On December 16, 2022, the FRB issued its final regulations which carry out the terms of the LIBOR Act, which became effective on February 27, 2023. These regulations: (i) address the applicability of the LIBOR Act to various LIBOR contracts, (ii) identify the FRB-selected benchmark replacements for various types of LIBOR contracts, (iii) include certain benchmark replacement conforming changes, (iv) address the issue of preemption and (v) provide other clarifications, definitions and information. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s LIBOR transition plan is organized around key work streams, including continued engagement with central banks and industry working groups and regulators, active client engagement, comprehensive review of legacy documentation, internal operational and technological readiness, and risk management, among other things, to facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates. 

The Bancorp has discontinued entering into new LIBOR-based contracts in accordance with regulatory guidance, except for permissible limited use, such as part of hedging and risk management programs. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Bancorp expanded its offering of alternative reference rate products, including SOFR. In addition, the Bancorp is continuing its transition of existing LIBOR-based exposures to an appropriate alternative reference rate on or before June 30, 2023. As of March 31, 2023, the Bancorp had substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products throughout several of its lines of business. These exposures included derivative contracts with a total notional value of approximately $87 billion, loans outstanding of approximately $18 billion, preferred stock of approximately $1.4 billion and long-term debt of approximately $62 million. The Bancorp currently estimates that approximately 5% of the existing exposures will mature before June 30, 2023. For the contracts that will not mature prior to June 30, 2023, an additional portion of these contracts is subject to contractual terms specifying alternative reference rates (&#8220;fallback provisions&#8221;) that would become effective upon cessation of LIBOR&#8217;s publication. Existing exposures without fallback provisions are expected to either be amended prior to June 30, 2023 to include such provisions or to transition to 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

an alternative reference rate pursuant to the terms of the LIBOR Act and its related regulations. The Bancorp does not expect the cessation of LIBOR on June 30, 2023 to have a material impact on its financial results. 

For a further discussion of the various risks the Bancorp faces in connection with the replacement of LIBOR on its operations, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Market Risks&#8212;The replacement of LIBOR could adversely affect Fifth Third&#8217;s revenue or expenses and the value of those assets or obligations.&#8221; in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Key Performance Indicators 

The Bancorp, as a banking institution, utilizes various key indicators of financial condition and operating results in managing and monitoring the performance of the business. In addition to traditional financial metrics, such as revenue and expense trends, the Bancorp monitors other financial measures that assist in evaluating growth trends, capital strength and operational efficiencies. The Bancorp analyzes these key performance indicators against its past performance, its forecasted performance and with the performance of its peer banking institutions. These indicators may change from time to time as the operating environment and businesses change. 

The following are some of the key indicators used by management to assess the Bancorp&#8217;s business performance, including those which are considered in the Bancorp&#8217;s compensation programs: 

&#8226; CET1 Capital Ratio: CET1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets as defined by the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets 

&#8226; Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (non-GAAP): Tangible net income available to common shareholders divided by average tangible common equity 

&#8226; Return on Average Common Equity, Excluding AOCI (non-GAAP): Net income available to common shareholders divided by total equity, excluding AOCI and preferred stock 

&#8226; Net Interest Margin (non-GAAP): Net interest income on an FTE basis divided by average interest-earning assets 

&#8226; Efficiency Ratio (non-GAAP): Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income 

&#8226; Earnings Per Share, Diluted: Net income allocated to common shareholders divided by average common shares outstanding after the effect of dilutive stock-based awards 

&#8226; Nonperforming Portfolio Assets Ratio: Nonperforming portfolio assets divided by portfolio loans and leases and OREO 

&#8226; Net Charge-off Ratio: Net losses charged-off divided by average portfolio loans and leases 

&#8226; Return on Average Assets: Net income divided by average assets 

&#8226; Loan-to-Deposit Ratio: Total loans divided by total deposits 

&#8226; Household Growth: Change in the number of consumer households with retail relationship-based checking accounts 

The list of indicators above is intended to summarize some of the most important metrics utilized by management in evaluating the Bancorp&#8217;s performance and does not represent an all-inclusive list of all performance measures that may be considered relevant or important to management or investors.

Earnings Summary 

The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2023 was $535 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, which was net of $23 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2022 was $474 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, which was net of $20 million in preferred stock dividends. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of $324 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income benefited from increases in market interest rates, resulting in increases in yields on average loans and leases and average other short-term investments for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from increases in average taxable securities, average commercial and industrial loans and average other consumer loans for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. These positive impacts were partially offset by increases in rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits and average long-term debt as well as increases in the average balances of FHLB advances and CDs over $250,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 3.29% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 2.59% for the comparable period in the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $164 million and $45 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Provision expense increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase in net charge-offs and other factors which caused an increase in the ACL from December 31, 2022, including higher period-end loan and lease balances and increases to specific reserves on individually evaluated commercial loans. The increase in period-end loan and lease balances was primarily driven by commercial and industrial loan growth and originations of point-of-sale solar energy installation loans. Net losses charged off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were 0.26% and 0.12% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO were 0.51% and 0.44%, respectively. For further discussion on credit quality, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Noninterest income increased $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in commercial banking revenue, securities gains and mortgage banking net revenue, partially offset by decreases in other noninterest income and service charges on deposits. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Noninterest expense increased $109 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits expense, other noninterest expense, technology and communications expense and marketing expense. 

For more information on net interest income, provision expense, noninterest income and noninterest expense refer to the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A. 

Capital Summary 

The Bancorp calculated its regulatory capital ratios under the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighting of assets and pursuant to the five-year transition provision option to phase in the effects of CECL on regulatory capital as of March 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2023, the Bancorp&#8217;s capital ratios, as defined by the U.S. banking agencies, were: 

&#8226; CET1 capital ratio: 9.28%; 

&#8226; Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio: 10.53%; 

&#8226; Total risk-based capital ratio: 12.64%; 

&#8226; Leverage ratio: 8.67%. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The following are non-GAAP financial measures which provide useful insight to the reader of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements but should be supplemental to primary U.S. GAAP measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for the primary U.S. GAAP measures. The Bancorp encourages readers to consider the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and leases and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income on an FTE basis, interest income on an FTE basis, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio to U.S. GAAP: 

TABLE 2: Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Financial Measures and Ratios on an FTE basis For the three months ended March 31, ($ in millions) 2023 2022 Net interest income (U.S. GAAP) $ 1,517 &#160; 1,195 Add: FTE adjustment 5 &#160; 3 Net interest income on an FTE basis (1) $ 1,522 &#160; 1,198 Net interest income on an FTE basis (annualized) (2) 6,173 &#160; 4,859 Interest income (U.S. GAAP) $ 2,213 &#160; 1,289 Add: FTE adjustment 5 &#160; 3 Interest income on an FTE basis $ 2,218 &#160; 1,292 Interest income on an FTE basis (annualized) (3) 8,995 &#160; 5,240 Interest expense (annualized) (4) $ 2,823 &#160; 381 Noninterest income (5) 696 &#160; 684 Noninterest expense (6) 1,331 &#160; 1,222 Average interest-earning assets (7) 187,407 &#160; 187,894 Average interest-bearing liabilities (8) 129,280 &#160; 116,764 Ratios: Net interest margin on an FTE basis (2) / (7) 3.29 &#160; % 2.59 Net interest rate spread on an FTE basis ((3) / (7)) - ((4) / (8)) 2.62 &#160; 2.46 Efficiency ratio on an FTE basis (6) / ((1) + (5)) 60.0 &#160; 64.9 

The Bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial institutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of return on average tangible common equity to U.S. GAAP: 

TABLE 3: Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Return on Average Tangible Common Equity For the three months ended March 31, ($ in millions) 

2023 2022 Net income available to common shareholders (U.S. GAAP) $ 535 &#160; 474 Add: Intangible amortization, net of tax 9 &#160; 9 Tangible net income available to common shareholders $ 544 &#160; 483 Tangible net income available to common shareholders (annualized) (1) 2,206 &#160; 1,959 Average Bancorp shareholders&#8217; equity (U.S. GAAP) $ 17,977 &#160; 21,402 Less: Average preferred stock 2,116 &#160; 2,116 Average goodwill 4,915 &#160; 4,514 Average intangible assets 163 &#160; 150 Average tangible common equity (2) $ 10,783 &#160; 14,622 Return on average tangible common equity (1) / (2) 20.5 &#160; % 13.4 

The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio and tangible common equity ratio, in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. As U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. 

The following table reconciles non-GAAP capital ratios to U.S. GAAP:

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of the significant new accounting standards applicable to the Bancorp and the expected impact of significant accounting standards issued, but not yet required to be adopted. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the Bancorp&#8217;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Bancorp&#8217;s critical accounting policies include the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

As further discussed in Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, on January 1, 2023, the Bancorp adopted ASU 2022-02 (&#8220;Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures&#8221;). In conjunction with the adoption of this amended guidance, the Bancorp has revised its Critical Accounting Policies for the ALLL as described below. Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for discussion on the accounting policy for the ALLL for periods prior to January 1, 2023. There have been no other material changes to the valuation techniques or models during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

ALLL 

The Bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the ALLL. The Bancorp&#8217;s portfolio segments include commercial, residential mortgage and consumer. The Bancorp further disaggregates its portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. For an analysis of the Bancorp&#8217;s ALLL by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related loans and leases. Contractual terms are adjusted for expected prepayments but are not extended for expected extensions, renewals or modifications except in circumstances where extension or renewal options are embedded in the original contract and not unconditionally cancellable by the Bancorp. Accrued interest receivable on loans is presented in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as a component of other assets. When accrued interest is deemed to be uncollectible (typically when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status), interest income is reversed. The Bancorp follows established policies for placing loans on nonaccrual status, so uncollectible accrued interest receivable is reversed in a timely manner. As a result, the Bancorp has elected not to measure a reserve for accrued interest receivable as part of its ALLL. However, the Bancorp does record a reserve for the portion of accrued interest receivable that it expects to be uncollectible. For additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s accounting policies related to nonaccrual loans and leases, refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the ALLL. The ALLL is maintained at a level the Bancorp considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability of loans and leases, including historical credit loss experience, current and forecasted market and economic conditions and consideration of various qualitative factors that, in management&#8217;s judgment, deserve consideration in estimating expected credit losses. Provisions for credit losses are recorded for the amounts necessary to adjust the ALLL to the Bancorp&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses on portfolio loans and leases. The Bancorp&#8217;s strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below legal lending limits and conservative underwriting, documentation and collections standards. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Refer to the Credit Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for additional information. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL requires significant management judgment and includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans and leases which are individually evaluated. 

Larger commercial loans and leases included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million on nonaccrual status are individually evaluated for an ALLL. The Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantor&#8217;s liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan or lease structure (including modifications, if any) and other factors when determining the amount of the ALLL. Other factors may include the borrower&#8217;s susceptibility to risks presented by the forecasted macroeconomic environment, the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower and the Bancorp&#8217;s evaluation of the borrower&#8217;s management. Significant management judgment is required when evaluating which of these factors are most relevant in individual circumstances, and when estimating the amount of expected credit losses based on those factors. When loans and leases are individually evaluated, allowances are determined based on management&#8217;s estimate of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan or lease given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options available to the Bancorp. Allowances for individually evaluated loans and leases that are collateral-dependent are measured based on the fair 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

value of the underlying collateral, less expected costs to sell where applicable. Individually evaluated loans and leases that are not collateral-dependent are measured based on the observable market value of the loan or lease or present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate. Specific allowances on individually evaluated commercial loans and leases are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. 

The Bancorp considers loans to be collateral-dependent when it becomes probable that repayment of the loan will be provided through the sale or operation of the collateral instead of from payments made by the borrower. The expected credit losses for these loans are typically estimated based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less expected costs to sell where applicable. Specific allowances on individually evaluated consumer and residential mortgage loans are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. 

Expected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for loans and leases that are not individually evaluated. For collectively evaluated loans and leases, the Bancorp uses models to forecast expected credit losses based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers prepayments and, for loans with available credit, expected utilization rates. The Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models were developed based on historical credit loss experience and observations of migration patterns for various credit risk characteristics (such as internal credit risk grades, external credit ratings or scores, delinquency status, loan-to-value trends, etc.) over time, with those observations evaluated in the context of concurrent macroeconomic conditions. The Bancorp developed its models from historical observations capturing a full economic cycle when possible. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. Generally, the Bancorp considers its forecasts to be reasonable and supportable for a period of up to three years from the estimation date. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, expected credit losses are estimated by reverting to historical loss information without adjustment for changes in economic conditions. This reversion is phased in over a two-year period. The Bancorp evaluates the length of its reasonable and supportable forecast period, its reversion period and reversion methodology at least annually, or more often if warranted by economic conditions or other circumstances. 

The Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the ALLL. These considerations inherently require significant management judgment to determine the appropriate factors to be considered and the extent of their impact on the ALLL estimate. Qualitative factors are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses but that are not fully captured within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models. These include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, lending and risk management personnel and results of internal audit and quality control reviews. These may also include adjustments, when deemed necessary, for specific idiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events, natural disasters and their effects on regional borrowers and changes in product structures. Qualitative factors may also be used to address the impacts of unforeseen events on key inputs and assumptions within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models, such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period, changes to historical loss information or changes to the reversion period or methodology. When evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is also given to regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated effect that changing economic conditions may have on the Bancorp&#8217;s customers. 

Overall, the collective evaluation process requires significant management judgment when determining the estimation methodology and inputs into the models, as well as in evaluating the reasonableness of the modeled results and the appropriateness of qualitative adjustments. The Bancorp&#8217;s forecasts of market and economic conditions and the internal risk grades assigned to loans and leases in the commercial portfolio segment are examples of inputs to the expected credit loss models that require significant management judgment. These inputs have the potential to drive significant variability in the resulting ALLL. 

Refer to the Allowance for Credit Losses subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for a discussion on the Bancorp&#8217;s ALLL sensitivity analysis.

STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest incurred on core deposits and wholesale funding. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Table 5 presents the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, as well as the relative impact of changes in the average balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses included in average other assets. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $1.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of $324 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income benefited from increases in market interest rates, resulting in increases in yields of 222 bps on average loans and leases and 447 bps on average other short-term investments for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income also benefited from increases in average taxable securities, average commercial and industrial loans and average other consumer loans of $15.7 billion, $5.6 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. These positive impacts were partially offset by increases in rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits of 163 bps and average long-term debt of 166 bps as well as increases in the average balance of FHLB advances of $4.8 billion and CDs over $250,000 of $4.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. Interest income recognized from PPP loans decreased to $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $20 million for the same period in the prior year. 

Net interest rate spread on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.62% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 2.46% for the comparable period in the prior year. Yields on average interest-earning assets increased 201 bps, partially offset by a 185 bps increase in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 3.29% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 2.59% for the comparable period in the prior year. Net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was positively impacted by the previously mentioned increase in the net interest rate spread. Net interest margin results are expected to stabilize or decrease modestly as the repricing of the Bancorp&#8217;s asset portfolios into higher rates are more than offset by the impact of rising rates on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. 

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from loans and leases increased $732 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 driven by the previously mentioned increases in market interest rates and average balances of commercial and industrial loans and other consumer loans. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A. Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from investment securities and other short-term investments increased $194 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to the previously mentioned increases in average taxable securities and yields on average other short-term investments. 

Interest expense on average core deposits increased $424 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to the previously mentioned increase in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 167 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2023 from 4 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2022, as a result of increasing short-term interest rates. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s deposits. 

Interest expense on average wholesale funding increased $178 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to the previously mentioned increases in the average balances of FHLB advances and CDs over $250,000 as well as an increase in rates paid on average long-term debt. Refer to the Borrowings subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information on the Bancorp&#8217;s borrowings. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, average wholesale funding represented 18% of average interest-bearing liabilities, compared to 11% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. For more information on the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, see the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Bancorp provides, as an expense, an amount for expected credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio that is based on factors previously discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of MD&#38;A. For a discussion of the factors used to determine the amount provided, as an expense, for expected credit losses within the portfolio of unfunded commitments, refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses expected in the portfolios. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the ALLL. The amount of loans and leases actually removed from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and leases. 

The provision for credit losses was $164 million and $45 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Provision expense increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase in net charge-offs and other factors which caused an increase in the ACL from December 31, 2022, including higher period-end loan and lease balances and increases to specific reserves on individually evaluated commercial loans. The increase in period-end loan and lease balances was primarily driven by growth in commercial and industrial loans and other consumer loans (primarily point-of-sale solar energy installation loans). 

The ALLL increased $21 million from December 31, 2022 to $2.2 billion at March 31, 2023 inclusive of a $49 million reduction from the impact of the adoption of ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. At March 31, 2023, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases decreased to 1.80%, compared to 1.81% at December 31, 2022. The reserve for unfunded commitments increased $16 million from December 31, 2022 to $232 million at March 31, 2023. At March 31, 2023, the ACL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases increased to 1.99%, compared to 1.98% at December 31, 2022. 

Refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on the provision for credit losses, including an analysis of loan and lease portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and determining the level of the ACL. 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income increased $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. 

The following table presents the components of noninterest income:

Commercial banking revenue 

Commercial banking revenue increased $26 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily driven by increases in loan syndication fees, fixed income sales and trading revenue and merger and acquisition fees, partially offset by a decrease in corporate bond fees. 

Wealth and asset management revenue 

Wealth and asset management revenue decreased $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to a decrease in private client service fees. The Bancorp&#8217;s trust and registered investment advisory businesses had approximately $542 billion and $549 billion in total assets under care as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and managed $57 billion and $61 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Service charges on deposits 

Service charges on deposits decreased $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 due to a decrease in service charges on both commercial and consumer deposits. Service charges on commercial deposits were $100 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $13 million from the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to higher treasury management earnings credits driven by market interest rates, partially offset by an increase in commercial treasury management fees. Service charges on consumer deposits were $37 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $2 million from the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to a decrease in consumer deposit fees driven by the elimination of non-sufficient funds fees during 2022. 

Card and processing revenue 

Card and processing revenue increased $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to increases in debit and commercial card interchange, driven by higher spend volumes. These increases were partially offset by increased reward costs. 

Mortgage banking net revenue 

Mortgage banking net revenue increased $17 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. 

The following table presents the components of mortgage banking net revenue:

(32) (44) Net mortgage servicing revenue 51 &#160; 27 Total mortgage banking net revenue $ 69 &#160; 52 

Origination fees and gains on loan sales decreased $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily driven by lower volumes of residential mortgage loan originations, partially offset by mark-to-market gains recognized on held for investment loans measured at fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Residential mortgage loan originations decreased to $1.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 from $3.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to the impact of higher market interest rates on refinance activity. 

The following table presents the components of net valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio and the impact of the Bancorp&#8217;s non-qualifying hedging strategy:

$ (32) (44) 

(a) Primarily reflects changes in prepayment speed and OAS assumptions which are updated based on market interest rates. 

(b) Primarily reflects changes due to realized cash flows and the passage of time. 

The Bancorp recognized losses of $53 million for three months ended March 31, 2023 and income of $137 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 in mortgage banking net revenue for valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio. The valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio included a decrease of $19 million and an increase of $190 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, due to changes in market rates and other inputs in the valuation model, including future prepayment speeds and OAS assumptions. Mortgage rates decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2023, which caused an increase in modeled prepayment speeds. There was also a decrease in the modeled OAS assumptions for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The fair value of the MSR 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

portfolio decreased $34 million and $53 million as a result of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Further detail on the valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation of the MSR portfolio. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. 

In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp acquires various securities as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. The Bancorp recognized gains of an immaterial amount during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and recognized net losses of $1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022, recorded in securities losses, net &#8211; non-qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights in the Bancorp&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s total residential mortgage loans serviced as of March 31, 2023 and 2022 were $120.4 billion and $114.5 billion, respectively, with $103.4 billion and $97.7 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others. 

Leasing business revenue 

Leasing business revenue decreased $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to a decrease in leasing business solutions revenue related to the disposition of LaSalle Solutions during the second quarter of 2022. 

Other noninterest income 

The following table presents the components of other noninterest income:

Class B Shares (31) (11) Other, net 1 &#160; 16 Total other noninterest income $ 22 &#160; 52 

Other noninterest income decreased $30 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares, partially offset by an increase in private equity investment income. 

The Bancorp recognized negative valuation adjustments of $31 million related to the Visa total return swap during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to negative valuation adjustments of $11 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022. For additional information on the valuation of the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares, refer to Note 22 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Private equity investment income increased $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by gains on sales recognized on certain private equity investments.

Compensation and benefits expense increased $46 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the additional personnel costs of an acquired business, the impact of raising the Bancorp&#8217;s minimum wage in the third quarter of 2022, an increase in non-qualified deferred compensation expense and severance expense, partially offset by a decrease in performance-based compensation. Full-time equivalent employees totaled 19,474 at March 31, 2023 compared to 19,247 at March 31, 2022. 

Technology and communications expense increased $17 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increased investment in strategic initiatives and technology modernization. 

Marketing expense increased $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in account acquisition programs. 

The following table presents the components of other noninterest expense:

Other noninterest expense increased $31 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in FDIC insurance and other taxes and losses and adjustments, partially offset by a decrease in loan and lease expense. 

FDIC insurance and other taxes increased $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in the FDIC insurance assessment rate. Losses and adjustments increased $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in credit valuation adjustments on customer accommodation derivatives and legal settlements, partially offset by a decrease in operational losses. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Loan and lease expense decreased $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by a decrease in loan servicing expenses related to the Bancorp&#8217;s sales of certain government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans that were previously in forbearance programs and serviced by a third party. 

Applicable Income Taxes 

The Bancorp&#8217;s income before income taxes, applicable income tax expense and effective tax rate are as follows: 

TABLE 12: Applicable Income Taxes For the three months ended March 31, ($ in millions) 2023 2022 Income before income taxes $ 718 &#160; 612 Applicable income tax expense 160 &#160; 118 Effective tax rate 22.3 &#160; &#160;% 19.2 

Applicable income tax expense for all periods presented includes the benefit from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, and tax credits (and other related tax benefits), partially offset by the effect of proportional amortization of qualifying LIHTC investments and certain nondeductible expenses. The tax credits are primarily associated with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program established under Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC, the Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC and the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program established under Section 1397E of the IRC. 

The effective tax rate increased to 22.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 19.2% for the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

Loans and Leases 

The Bancorp classifies its commercial loans and leases based upon primary purpose and consumer loans based upon product or collateral. Table 13 summarizes end of period loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale, and Table 14 summarizes average total loans and leases, including average loans and leases held for sale. 

TABLE 13: Components of Total Loans and Leases (including loans and leases held for sale) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 As of ($ in millions) Carrying Value % of Total Carrying Value % of Total Commercial loans and leases: Commercial and industrial loans $ 57,741 &#160; 47 &#160; % $ 57,305 47 &#160;% Commercial mortgage loans 11,228 &#160; 9 &#160; 11,020 9 Commercial construction loans 5,548 &#160; 5 &#160; 5,433 4 Commercial leases 2,746 &#160; 2 &#160; 2,704 2 Total commercial loans and leases $ 77,263 &#160; 63 &#160; % $ 76,462 62 % Consumer loans: Residential mortgage loans 18,333 &#160; 15 &#160; 18,562 15 Home equity 3,958 &#160; 3 &#160; 4,039 3 Indirect secured consumer loans 16,484 &#160; 13 &#160; 16,552 14 Credit card 1,761 &#160; 1 &#160; 1,874 2 Other consumer loans 5,807 &#160; 5 &#160; 4,998 4 Total consumer loans $ 46,343 &#160; 37 &#160; % $ 46,025 38 % Total loans and leases $ 123,606 &#160; 100 &#160; &#160;% $ 122,487 100 % Total portfolio loans and leases

$ 122,857 &#160; $ 121,480 

Total loans and leases, including loans and leases held for sale, increased $1.1 billion, or 1%, from December 31, 2022 as a result of a $801 million, or 1%, increase in commercial loans and leases and a $318 million, or 1%, increase in consumer loans and leases. 

Commercial loans and leases increased $801 million from December 31, 2022 primarily due to increases in commercial and industrial loans, commercial mortgage loans and commercial construction loans. Commercial and industrial loans increased $436 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of increased revolving line of credit utilization and increased production. Commercial mortgage loans increased $208 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2022 as loan originations exceeded payoffs. Commercial construction loans increased $115 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2022 as draws on existing commitments and loan originations exceeded payoffs. 

Consumer loans increased $318 million from December 31, 2022 driven by an increase in other consumer loans, partially offset by decreases in residential mortgage loans, credit card, home equity and indirect secured consumer loans. Other consumer loans increased $809 million, or 16%, from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by originations of point-of-sale solar energy installation loans. Residential mortgage loans decreased $229 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2022 primarily due to decreases in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp sold government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs. Credit card decreased $113 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2022 primarily due to seasonal paydowns on year-end balances. Home equity decreased $81 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2022 as payoffs exceeded loan originations and new advances. Indirect secured consumer loans decreased $68 million from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by paydowns exceeding loan originations.

Average loans and leases, including average loans and leases held for sale, increased $6.5 billion, or 6%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of a $6.1 billion, or 9%, increase in average commercial loans and leases. 

Average commercial loans and leases increased $6.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in average commercial and industrial loans, average commercial mortgage loans and average commercial construction loans, partially offset by a decrease in average commercial leases. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $5.6 billion, or 11%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increased revolving line of credit utilization and increased production, partially offset by PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns. Average commercial mortgage loans increased $592 million, or 6%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year as loan originations exceeded payoffs. Average commercial construction loans increased $136 million, or 3%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year as draws on existing commitments and loan originations exceeded payoffs. Average commercial leases decreased $280 million, or 10%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship-based lease originations. 

Average consumer loans increased $363 million, or 1%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in average other consumer loans and average credit card, partially offset by decreases in average residential mortgage loans and average indirect secured consumer loans. Average other consumer loans increased $2.7 billion, or 97%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by originations of point-of-sale solar energy installation loans, in addition to loans acquired in a business acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2022. Average credit card increased $89 million, or 5%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in balance-active customers, average balances per active account and card utilization rates. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $1.9 billion, or 9%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp sold government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs. Average indirect secured consumer loans decreased $538 million, or 3%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by paydowns and lower production. 

Investment Securities 

The Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing collateral for pledging purposes and for liquidity risk management. Total investment securities were $52.2 billion at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The taxable available-for-sale debt and other investment securities portfolio had an effective duration o f 5.3 at March 31, 2023 compared to 5.4 at December 31, 2022. 

Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in management&#8217;s judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. Securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities are classified as trading typically when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the ne ar term. At March 31, 2023, the Bancorp&#8217;s investment portfolio consisted primarily of AAA-rated available-for-sale debt and other securities. The Bancorp held an immaterial amount of below-investment grade available-for-sale debt and other securities at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

At both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Bancorp completed its evaluation of the available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position and did not recognize an allowance for credit losses. The Bancorp did not recognize provision expense related to available-for-sale debt and other securities in an unrealized loss position during both the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of investment securities: 

TABLE 15: Components of Investment Securities As of ($ in millions) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Available-for-sale debt and other securities (amortized cost basis): U.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities $ 2,828 &#160; 2,683 Obligations of states and political subdivisions securities 3 &#160; 18 Mortgage-backed securities: Agency residential mortgage-backed securities 12,246 &#160; 12,604 Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities 29,231 &#160; 29,824 Non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities 5,057 &#160; 5,235 Asset-backed securities and other debt securities 5,703 &#160; 6,292 Other securities (a)

(a) Other securities consist of FHLB, FRB and DTCC restricted stock hold ings that are carried at cost. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities de creased $1.6 billion f rom December 31, 2022 primarily due to decreases in agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and other debt securities and agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Trading debt securities increased $760 million from December 31, 2022 primarily due to purchases of U.S. Treasury securities during the three months ended March 31, 2023 related to the Bancorp&#8217;s management of collateral posted for derivative exposures. 

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities wer e 29% an d 30% of total interest-earning assets at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio was 6.8 years at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. In addition, the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 2.97% at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Information presented in Table 16 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is presented on an FTE basis and is computed using amortized cost balances and reflects the impact of prepayments. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio exclude other securities that have no stated yield or maturity. Total net unrealized losses on the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio were $5.2 billion and $6.0 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The fair values of investment securities are impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of the Bancorp&#8217;s investment securities portfolio generally decreases when interest rates increase or when credit spreads widen.

Other Short-Term Investments 

Other short-term investments primarily include overnight interest-earning investments, including reserves held at the FRB. The Bancorp uses other short-term investments as part of its liquidity risk management tools. Other short-term investments wer e $9.8 billion and $8.4 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The increase of $1.4 billion from December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to the Bancorp&#8217;s decision to increase its liquidity position in response to conditions in the operating environment as of March 31, 2023. 

Deposits 

The Bancorp&#8217;s deposit balances represent an important source of funding and revenue growth opportunity. The Bancorp continues to focus on core deposit growth in its retail and commercial franchises by improving customer satisfaction, building full relationships and offering competitive rates. Average core deposits represented 76% and 81% of average total assets for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

(a) Includes $5.2 billion of retail brokered certificates of deposit which are covered by FDIC insurance. 

Core deposits decreased $3.1 billion, or 2%, from December 31, 2022 primarily due to seasonality and balance migration as a result of the higher interest rate environment with a decrease in transaction deposits, partially offset by an increase in CDs $250,000 or less. Transaction deposits decreased $5.9 billion, or 4%, from December 31, 2022 primarily with decreases in demand deposits, interest checking deposits and savings deposits, partially offset by an increase in money market deposits. In response to the higher interest rate environment, deposit balances have migrated and are expected to continue to migrate from noninterest-bearing products such as demand deposits into higher interest-bearing products such as money market accounts and CDs. Demand deposits decreased $3.5 billion, or 7%, from December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of lower balances per commercial customer account and balance migration into interest checking deposits, partially offset by consumer balance growth. Interest checking deposits decreased $1.7 billion, or 3%, from December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of lower balances per consumer customer account, partially offset by commercial balance growth and balance migration from demand deposits. Savings deposits decreased $906 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of lower balances per consumer customer account due to increased consumer spending. Money market deposits increased $262 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of higher balances per consumer customer account due to higher offering rates, partially offset by lower balances per commercial customer account. CDs $250,000 or less increased $2.8 billion, or 74%, from December 31, 2022 primarily due to higher offering rates. 

CDs over $250,000 increased $2.4 billion, or 73%, from December 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in retail brokered CDs issued, which are utilized as a short-term funding source.

On an average basis, core deposits decreased $12.1 billion, or 7%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year due to a decrease in average transaction deposits, partially offset by an increase in average CDs $250,000 or less. Average transaction deposits decreased $14.9 billion, or 9% primarily driven by decreases in average demand deposits and average money market deposits, partially offset by increases in average savings deposits and average interest checking deposits. Average demand deposits decreased $13.5 billion, or 21%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of lower average balances per customer account and balance migration into interest checking deposits. Average money market deposits decreased $1.8 billion, or 6%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of lower average balances per commercial customer account and balance migration into interest checking deposits, partially offset by higher average

balances per consumer customer account. Average savings deposits increased $335 million, or 1%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in derivative collateral posted as a result of higher interest rates, partially offset by lower average balances per consumer customer account due to increased consumer spending. Average interest checking deposits increased $58 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of balance migration from demand deposits and money market deposits, partially offset by lower average balances per customer account. Average CDs $250,000 or less increased $2.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher offering rates. Lower average commercial customer account balances in demand deposits, money market deposits and interest checking deposits included the impact of deliberate runoff during the second quarter of 2022 of certain higher cost commercial deposits. 

Average CDs over $250,000 increased $4.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in retail brokered CDs issued.

Deposit insurance 

The FDIC generally provides a standard amount of insurance of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category defined by the FDIC. Depositors may qualify for coverage of accounts over $250,000 if they have funds in different ownership categories and all FDIC requirements are met. All deposits that an account owner has in the same ownership category at the same bank are added together and insured up to the standard insurance amount. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, approximately $98.2 billion, or 60%, and $94.1 billion, or 58%, respectively, of the Bancorp&#8217;s domestic deposits were insured. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, approximately $64.6 billion and $69.4 billion, respectively, of the Bancorp&#8217;s domestic deposits were uninsured. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, approximately $1.3 billion and $727 million, respectively, of the Bancorp&#8217;s time deposits were not fully insured. The estimated uninsured portions of those time deposits were $542 million and $306 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Where information is not readily available to determine the amount of insured deposits, the amount of uninsured deposits is estimated, consistent with the methodologies and assumptions utilized in providing information to the Bank&#8217;s regulators. 

Borrowings 

The Bancorp accesses a variety of short-term and long-term funding sources. Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term and include federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. Total average borrowings as a percent of average interest-bearing liabilities we re 15% and 11% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

The following table summarizes the end of period components of borrowings:

Total borr owings increased $1.7 billion , or 9% , fro m December 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in other short-term borrowings partially offset by a decrease in long-term debt. Other short-term borrowings increased $2.5 billion from December 31, 2022 primarily due to the Bancorp&#8217;s decision to increase its liquidity position in response to conditions in the current operating environment. T he level of other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and the sources that are used to satisfy those needs. For further information on the components of other short-term borrowings, ref er to Note 15 of th e Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-term d ebt decreased $821 million f rom December 31, 2022 primarily driven by redemptions of $825 million of

Total average borrowin gs increased $7.1 billion , or 57% , for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in average other short-term borrowings, average long-term debt and average federal funds purchased. Average other short-term borrowings and average federal funds purchased increased $4.5 billion and $228 million , respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased funding needs resulting from an increase in average investment securities, lower core deposit balances and the Bancorp&#8217;s decision to increase its liquidity position in response to conditions in the current operating environment . Average long-term debt increased $2.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by issuances of senior fixed-rate/floating-rate notes in 2022 totaling $4.0 billion, partially offset by redemptions of $1.5 billion of notes, $219 million of fair value adjustments associated with hedged long-term debt and $206 million of paydowns associated with loan securitizations since March 31, 2022. Information on the average rates paid on borrowings is discussed in the Net Interest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A. In addition, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&#38;A for a discussion on the role of borrowings in the Bancorp&#8217;s liquidity management.

BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW 

The Bancorp reports on three business segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Small Business Banking and Wealth and Asset Management. Additional information on each business segment is included in Note 23 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp&#8217;s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management&#8217;s accounting practices and businesses change. 

The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp&#8217;s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third&#8217;s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing. 

The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. In general, the charge rates on assets increased since December 31, 2022 as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. The credit rates for deposit products also increased since December 31, 2022, due to higher interest rates and modified assumptions. Thus, net interest income for asset-generating business segments was negatively impacted by the rates charged on assets while deposit-providing business segments were positively impacted during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for allocating provision for credit losses to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. Provision for credit losses attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of relationship depth opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit. 

The following table summarizes net income (loss) by business segment:

Refer to the Applicable Income Taxes subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A for additional information. 

Net income was $580 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $341 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net interest income on an FTE basis, partially offset by increases in provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis increased $455 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in yields on and average balances of commercial loans and leases as well as increases in FTP credit rates on deposits . These positive impacts were partially offset by increases in FTP charges on commercial loans and leases as well as increases in rates paid on interest checking deposits and savings and money market deposits. 

The provision for credit losses was $46 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to a benefit from credit losses of $34 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in provision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in commercial criticized asset levels as well as an increase in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans. Annualized net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases increased to 15 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to 3 bps for the same period in the prior year. 

Noninterest income decreased $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in service charges on deposits, other noninterest income and leasing business revenue, partially offset by an increase in commercial banking revenue. Service charges on deposits decreased $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior yea r primarily due to higher treasury management earnings credits driven by market interest rates, partially offset by an increase in commercial treasury management fees. Other noninterest income decreased $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the recognition of securities losses during the three months ended

March 31, 2023 . Leasing business revenue decreased $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in leasing business solutions revenue related to the disposition of LaSalle Solutions during the second quarter of 2022. Commercial banking revenue increased $25 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior yea r primarily driven by increases in loan syndication fees, fixed income sales and trading revenue and merger and acquisition fees, partially offset by a decrease in corporate bond fees. 

Noninterest expense increased $72 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in other noninterest expense and compensation and benefits expense. Other noninterest expense increased $62 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in allocated expenses, credit valuation adjustments on customer accommodation derivatives and FDIC insurance and other taxes. The increase in allocated expenses was primarily related to cash management services, information technology support services and employee compensation. Compensation and benefits expense increased $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation. 

Average commercial loans and leases increased $6.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in average commercial and industrial loans, average commercial mortgage loans and average commercial construction loans, partially offset by a decrease in average commercial leases. Average commercial and industrial loans increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven b y increased revolving line of credit utilization and increased production. Average commercial mortgage loans increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year as loan originations exceeded payoffs. Average commercial construction loans increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year as draws on existing commitments and loan originations exceeded payoffs. Average commercial leases decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship-based lease originations. 

Average deposits decreased $10.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in average demand deposits and average savings and money market deposits, partially offset by an increase in average interest checking deposits. Average demand deposits decreased $12.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of lower average balances per commercial customer account and balance migration into interest checking deposits.

Net income was $659 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $112 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increases in net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by increases in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. 

Net interest income increased $740 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in FTP credit rates on deposits as well as an increase in yields on and average balances of loans. These positive impacts were partially offset by an increase in FTP charge rates on loans as well as increases in rates paid on deposits. 

Provision for credit losses increased $22 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in net charge-offs on other consumer loans, indirect secured consumer loans and credit card.

Noninterest expense increased $44 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in other noninterest expense and compensation and benefits expense. Other noninterest expense increased $31 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in allocated expenses, FDIC insurance and other taxes and marketing expense. The increase in allocated expenses was primarily related to information technology support services and employee compensation. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in loan servicing expenses related to the Bancorp&#8217;s sales of certain government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans that were previously in forbearance programs and serviced by a third party. Compensation and benefits expense increased $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the incremental impact of acquired businesses and the impact of raising the Bancorp&#8217;s minimum wage in the third quarter of 2022, partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation related to lower residential mortgage origination volumes. 

Average consumer loans increased $160 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in average other consumer loans, partially offset by decreases in average residential mortgage loans and average indirect secured consumer loans.

Average residential mortgage loans decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp sold government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs. A verage indirect consumer loans decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by paydowns and lower production. Average commercial loans increased $1.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial mortgage loans as loan originations exceeded payoffs. 

Average deposits decreased $1.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in average interest checking deposits, average savings and money market deposits and average demand deposits, partially offset by an increase in average certificates of deposit. A verage interest checking deposits decreased $1.9 billion, average savings and money market deposits decreased $1.1 billion and a verage demand deposits decreased $870 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of lower average balances per customer account due to increased consumer spending.

Net income was $74 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $29 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income and an increase in noninterest expense. 

Net interest income increased $66 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase in FTP credit rates on deposits as well as an increase in yields on loans and leases. These positive impacts were partially offset by increases in rates paid on average deposits and an increase in FTP charge rates on loans and leases for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Noninterest income decreased $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in wealth and asset management revenue, which decreased $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 driven by a decrease in private client service fees. 

Noninterest expense increased $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase in other noninterest expense. Other noninterest expense increased $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily as a result of an increase in allocated expenses related to information technology support services and employee compensation . 

Average loans and leases increased $309 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increases in average other consumer loans, average residential mortgage loans, average commercial mortgage and average commercial and industrial loans as a result of higher loan production. 

Average deposits decreased $1.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by decreases in average interest checking deposits and average demand deposits as a result of lower average balances per customer account, partially offset by an increase in average savings and money market deposits.

General Corporate and Other includes the unallocated portion of the investment securities portfolio, securities gains and losses, certain non-core deposit funding, unassigned equity, unallocated provision for credit losses expense or a benefit from the reduction of the ACL, the payment of preferred stock dividends and certain support activities and other items not attributed to the business segments. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis decreased $938 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase in FTP credits on deposits allocated to the business segments as well as increases in interest expense on long-term debt, other short-term borrowings and deposits and the impact of losses from cash flow hedges used to manage interest rate risk recognized in interest income. These negative impacts were partially offset by an increase in the benefit related to FTP charge rates on loans and leases allocated to the business segments as well as increases in interest income on investment securities. 

The provision for credit losses increased $17 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase in net charge-offs and other factors which caused an increase in the ACL from December 31, 2022, including higher period-end loan and lease balances and increases to specific reserves on individually evaluated commercial loans, partially offset by the impact of allocations to the business segments. 

Noninterest income increased $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the recognition of net securities gains during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to net securities losses during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and an increase in private equity investment income, partially offset by an increase in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares. 

Noninterest expense decreased $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the impact of an increase in corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits due to an increase in non-qualified deferred compensation expense as well as an increase in technology and communications expense.

RISK MANAGEMENT - OVERVIEW 

The Risk Management Overview section included in Item 7 of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K describes the Bancorp&#8217;s Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Three Lines of Defense structure as well as key areas of risk, which include credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, price risk, legal and regulatory compliance risk, operational risk, reputation risk and strategic risk. Item 7 of the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K also includes additional detailed information about the Bancorp&#8217;s processes related to operational risk management as well as legal and regulatory compliance risk management. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT 

The objective of the Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the Bancorp. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. The Bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices which are described below. These practices include the use of intentional risk-based limits for single name exposures and counterparty selection criteria designed to reduce or eliminate exposure to borrowers who have higher than average default risk and defined weaknesses in financial performance. The Bancorp carefully designs and monitors underwriting, documentation and collection standards. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Credit officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority amounts based on risk and exposure amount, the use of which is closely monitored. Underwriting activities are centrally managed, and Credit Risk Management manages the policy and the authority delegation process directly. The Credit Risk Review function provides independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk grades and the charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. The Bancorp&#8217;s credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the ACL is based on quarterly assessments of the estimated losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp uses these assessments to maintain an adequate ACL and record any necessary charge-offs. Additional loans and leases with probable or observed credit weaknesses receive enhanced monitoring and undergo a periodic review. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s credit grade categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions. In addition, stress testing is performed on various commercial and consumer portfolios utilizing various models. For certain portfolios, such as real estate and leveraged lending, stress testing is performed at the individual loan level during credit underwriting. 

In addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems. The first of these risk grading systems is based on regulatory guidance for credit risk systems. These ratings are used by the Bancorp to monitor and manage its credit risk. The Bancorp also separately maintains a dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing, portfolio monitoring and capital allocation that includes a &#8220;through-the-cycle&#8221; rating philosophy for assessing a borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness. This &#8220;through-the-cycle&#8221; rating philosophy uses a grading scale that assigns ratings based on average default rates through an entire business cycle for borrowers with similar financial performance. The dual risk rating system includes thirteen grade categories for estimating probabilities of default and an additional eleven grade categories for estimating losses given an event of default. The probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the regulatory risk rating system. 

The Bancorp utilizes internally developed models to estimate expected credit losses for portfolio loans and leases. For loans and leases that are collectively evaluated, the Bancorp utilizes these models to forecast expected credit losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Bancorp&#8217;s processes for developing these models, estimating credit losses for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period and for estimating credit losses for individually evaluated loans. 

For the commercial portfolio segment, the estimated probabilities of default are primarily based on the probability of default ratings assigned under the through-the-cycle dual risk rating system and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. 

For collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower&#8217;s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The Bancorp also utilizes

various scoring systems, analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring processes to assess the credit risk of the consumer and residential mortgage portfolios. 

Overview 

Financial market volatility remained elevated during the first quarter of 2023. The Federal Reserve created an additional liquidity facility for banks in response to recent idiosyncratic bank failures. Despite the volatility, both equities and bonds posted gains for the first quarter of 2023 as markets priced in expectations of decreased interest rates in future periods. At the recent FOMC meeting, FRB officials indicated greater uncertainty around future rate increases as tighter credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity. The adjustment to a positive real federal funds rate is expected to be disruptive to economic activity as banks focus on building liquidity and capital ahead of a potential recession. 

Although employment data has remained resilient, other economic reports for consumer spending and business investment, along with sentiment surveys, have indicated a slowing economy. The downside risks to the economic outlook continue to increase as persistent inflation above the FRB&#8217;s 2% target may force the FOMC to keep interest rates higher for longer. Increasing geopolitical tensions may also lead to higher commodity prices and reverse some of the easing seen recently in headline inflation. Against this backdrop, tighter liquidity in the banking sector is limiting the supply of credit in the economy. Over time, these factors are expected to adversely impact business investment, job growth and consumer spending and ultimately may lead to a recession beginning as early as late 2023. 

Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 

On January 1, 2023, the Bancorp adopted ASU 2022-02, which eliminated the accounting guidance on TDRs for creditors for all loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty occurring on or after January 1, 2023. For further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s adoption of ASU 2022-02, refer to Note 3 and Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Commercial Portfolio 

The Bancorp&#8217;s credit risk management strategy seeks to minimize concentrations of risk through diversification. The Bancorp has commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of business within the commercial segment, geography and credit product type. The risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and continuous portfolio risk management reporting. 

The Bancorp is closely monitoring various economic conditions and their impacts on commercial borrowers, including the pace of inflation, rising interest rates, labor and supply chain issues, volatility and changes in consumer discretionary spending patterns, among others. The Bancorp maintains focus on disciplined client selection, adherence to underwriting policy and attention to borrower and industry concentrations. 

The Bancorp provides loans to a variety of customers ranging from large multinational firms to middle market businesses, sole proprietors and high net worth individuals. The origination policies for commercial and industrial loans outline the risks and underwriting requirements for loans to businesses in various industries. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, collateral and leverage requirements, cash flow coverage measures and hold limits. The Bancorp aligns credit and sales teams with specific industry and regional expertise to better monitor and manage different industry and geographic segments of the portfolio.

The origination policies for commercial real estate outline the risks and underwriting requirements for owner and nonowner-occupied and construction lending. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, maximum LTVs, minimum debt service coverage ratios, construction loan monitoring procedures, appraisal requirements, pre-leasing requirements (as applicable), pro forma analysis requirements and interest rate sensitivity. The Bancorp requires a valuation of real estate collateral, which may include third-party appraisals, be performed at the time of origination and renewal in accordance with regulatory requirements and on an as-needed basis when market conditions justify. The Bancorp maintains an appraisal review department to order and review third-party appraisals in accordance with regulatory requirements. Collateral values on nonaccrual assets with relationships exceeding $1 million are reviewed quarterly to assess the appropriateness of the 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

value ascribed in the assessment of charge-offs and specific reserves. Additionally, collateral values are also reviewed at least annually for all criticized assets. 

The Bancorp assesses all real estate and non-real estate collateral securing a loan and considers all cross-collateralized loans in the calculation of the LTV ratio. The following tables provide detail on the most recent LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans greater than $1 million, excluding commercial mortgage loans that are individually evaluated for an ACL. The Bancorp does not typically aggregate the LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans less than $1 million.

Consumer Portfolio 

Consumer credit risk management utilizes a framework that encompasses consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting credit risk. These processes are supported by a credit risk governance structure that includes Board oversight, policies, risk limits and risk committees. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s consumer portfolio is materially comprised of five categories of loans: residential mortgage loans, home equity, indirect secured consumer loans, credit card and other consumer loans. The Bancorp has identified certain credit characteristics within these five categories of loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio. The Bancorp does not update LTVs for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except as part of the charge-off process for real estate secured loans. The Bancorp actively manages the consumer portfolio through concentration limits, which mitigate credit risk through limiting the exposure to lower FICO scores, higher LTVs, specific geographic concentration risks and additional risk elements. 

The Bancorp continues to ensure that underwriting standards and guidelines adequately account for the broader economic conditions that the consumer portfolio faces in a rising-rate environment. Guidelines are designed to ensure that the various consumer products fall within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk appetite. These guidelines will be monitored and adjusted as deemed appropriate in response to the prevailing economic conditions while remaining within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance limits. 

The payment structures for certain variable rate products (such as residential mortgage loans, home equity and credit card) are susceptible to changes in benchmark interest rates. With increases in interest rates, minimum payments on these products also increase, raising the potential for the environment to be disruptive to some borrowers. The Bancorp actively monitors the portion of its consumer portfolio that is susceptible to increases in minimum payments and continues to assess the impact on the overall risk appetite and soundness of the portfolio. 

Residential mortgage portfolio 

The Bancorp manages credit risk in the residential mortgage portfolio through underwriting guidelines that limit exposure to loan characteristics determined to influence credit risk. Additionally, the portfolio is governed by concentration limits that ensure geographic, product and channel diversification. The Bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio. 

The Bancorp does not originate residential mortgage loans that permit customers to defer principal payments or make payments that are less than the accruing interest. The Bancorp originates both fixed-rate and ARM loans. Within the ARM portfolio, approximately $518 million of ARM loans will have rate resets during the next twelve months. Of these resets, 98% are expected to experience an increase in rate, with an average increase of approximately 1.95%. Underlying characteristics of these borrowers are relatively strong with a weighted average origination DTI of 34% and weighted average origination LTV of 72%. 

Certain residential mortgage products have characteristics that may increase the Bancorp &#8217; s credit loss rates in the event of a decline in housing values. These types of mortgage products offered by the Bancorp include loans with high LTVs, multiple loans secured by the same collateral that when combined result in an LTV greater than 80% and interest-only loans. The Bancorp has deemed residential mortgage loans with greater than 80% LTVs and no mortgage insurance as loans that represent a higher level of risk.

Home equity portfolio 

The Bancorp&#8217;s home equity portfolio is primarily comprised of home equity lines of credit. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, the Bancorp&#8217;s newly originated home equity lines of credit have a 10-year interest-only draw period followed by a 20-year amortization period. The home equity line of credit previously offered by the Bancorp was a revolving facility with a 20-year term, minimum payments of interest-only and a balloon payment of principal at maturity. Approximately 34% of the outstanding balances of the Bancorp&#8217;s portfolio of home equity lines of credit have a balloon structure at maturity. Peak maturity years for the balloon home equity lines of credit are 2025 to 2028 and approximately 13% of the balances mature before 2025. 

The ALLL provides coverage for expected losses in the home equity portfolio. The allowance attributable to the portion of the home equity portfolio that is collectively evaluated is determined on a pooled basis using a probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default model framework to generate expected losses. The expected losses for the home equity portfolio are dependent upon loan 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

delinquency, FICO scores, LTV, loan age and their historical correlation with macroeconomic variables including unemployment and the home price index. The expected losses generated from models are adjusted by certain qualitative adjustment factors to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends. The qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. 

The home equity portfolio is managed in two primary groups: loans outstanding with a combined LTV greater than 80% and those loans with an LTV of 80% or less based upon appraisals at origination. For additional information on these loans, refer to Table 35 and Table 36. Of the total $4.0 billion of outstanding home equity loans: 

&#8226; 77% reside within the Bancorp&#8217;s Midwest footprint of Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky as of March 31, 2023; 

&#8226; 38% are in senior lien positions and 62% are in junior lien positions at March 31, 2023; 

&#8226; 77% of non-delinquent borrowers made at least one payment greater than the minimum payment during the three months ended March 31, 2023; and 

&#8226; The portfolio had a weighted average refreshed FICO score of 750 at March 31, 2023. 

The Bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes adjustments in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Bancorp does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTVs after origination. However, the Bancorp monitors the local housing markets by reviewing various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring processes. For junior lien home equity loans which become 60 days or more past due, the Bancorp tracks the performance of the senior lien loans in which the Bancorp is the servicer and utilizes consumer credit bureau attributes to monitor the status of the senior lien loans that the Bancorp does not service. If the senior lien loan is found to be 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status unless both loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, if the junior lien home equity loan becomes 120 days or more past due and the senior lien loan is also 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is assessed for charge-off.

It is a common industry practice to advance on these types of loans an amount in excess of the collateral value due to the inclusion of negative equity trade-in, maintenance/warranty products, taxes, title and other fees paid at closing. The Bancorp monitors its exposure to these higher risk loans.

Credit card portfolio 

The credit card portfolio consists of predominantly prime accounts with 98% of balances existing within the Bancorp&#8217;s footprint at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 71% and 72%, respectively, of the outstanding balances were originated through branch-based relationships with the remainder coming from direct mail campaigns and online acquisitions. 

Given the variable nature of the credit card portfolio, interest rate increases impact this product and it is regularly monitored to ensure the portfolio remains within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance.

Other consumer portfolio loans 

Other consumer portfolio loans are comprised of secured and unsecured loans originated through the Bancorp&#8217;s branch network, home improvement and solar energy installation loans originated through a network of contractors and installers, and other point-of-sale loans originated or purchased in connection with third-party companies. The Bancorp closely monitors the credit performance of point-of-sale loans. Loans originated in connection with one third-party company are impacted by certain credit loss protection coverage provided by that company. The Bancorp discontinued origination of new loans with this third-party company in September 2022.

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal and/or interest is uncertain and certain other assets, including OREO and other repossessed property. A summary of nonperforming assets is included in Table 43. For further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s policies related to accounting for delinquent and nonperforming loans and leases, refer to the Nonaccrual Loans and Leases section of Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Nonperforming assets were $623 million at March 31, 2023 compared to $539 million at December 31, 2022. 

Nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO were 0.51% and 0.44% at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Nonaccrual loans and leases secured by real estate were 39% of nonaccrual loans and leases as of March 31, 2023 compared to 42% as of December 31, 2022. 

Portfolio commercial nonaccrual loans and leases were $334 million at March 31, 2023, an increase of $71 million from December 31, 2022. Portfolio consumer nonaccrual loans were $259 million at March 31, 2023, an increase of $7 million from December 31, 2022. Refer to Table 44 for a rollforward of portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases. 

OREO and other repossessed property was $30 million and $24 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Bancorp recognized an immaterial amount of losses and $1 million of gains on the transfer, sale or write-down of OREO properties for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately $10 million and $6 million, respectively, of interest income would have been recognized if the nonaccrual portfolio loans and leases had been current in accordance with their contractual terms. Although these values help demonstrate the costs of carrying nonaccrual credits, the Bancorp does not expect to recover the full amount of interest as nonaccrual loans and leases are generally carried below their principal balance.

Analysis of Net Loan Charge-offs 

Net charge-offs were 26 bps and 12 bps of average portfolio loans and leases for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Table 46 provides a summary of credit loss experience and net charge-offs as a percentage of average portfolio loans and leases outstanding by loan category. 

The ratio of commercial loan and lease net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio commercial loans and leases increased to 17 bps during the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to 5 bps during the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans of $21 million. 

The ratio of consumer loan net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio consumer loans increased to 42 bps during the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to 25 bps during the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in net charge-offs on other consumer loans and indirect secured consumer loans of $10 million and $7 million, respectively.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses is comprised of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. As described in Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related loans and leases (as adjusted for prepayments). The Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans and leases which are individually evaluated. For collectively evaluated loans and leases, the Bancorp uses quantitative models to forecast expected credit losses based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting, the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default. The Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. 

The Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the ALLL. Qualitative adjustments are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses which are not fully captured within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models. These factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, lending and risk management personnel and results of internal audit and quality control reviews. In addition, the qualitative adjustment framework can be utilized to address specific idiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events, natural disasters or changes in current economic conditions that are not reflected in the quantitative credit loss models, and their effects on regional borrowers and changes in product structures. Qualitative factors may also be used to address the impacts of unforeseen events on key inputs and assumptions within the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models, such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period, changes to historical loss information or changes to the reversion period or methodology. 

In addition to the ALLL, the Bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the Bancorp&#8217;s methodology for determining the ALLL. The provision for unfunded commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

For the commercial portfolio segment, the estimates for probability of default are primarily based on internal ratings assigned to each commercial borrower on a 13-point scale and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions. For loans with available credit, the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. 

For collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments, the Bancorp&#8217;s expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrower&#8217;s FICO score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default. The estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms (such as residential mortgage loans and home equity) and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges (such as home equity). The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable, which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions. 

At both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Bancorp used three forward-looking economic scenarios during the reasonable and supportable forecast period in its expected credit loss models to address the inherent imprecision in macroeconomic forecasting. Each of the three scenarios was developed by a third party that is subject to the Bancorp&#8217;s Third-Party Risk Management program including oversight by the Bancorp&#8217;s independent model risk management group. The scenarios included a most likely outcome (Baseline) and two less probable scenarios with one being more favorable than the Baseline and the other being less favorable. The more favorable alternative scenario (Upside) depicted a stronger near-term growth outlook while the less favorable outlook (Downside) depicted a moderate recession. 

The Baseline scenario was developed such that the expectation is that the economy will perform better than the projection 50% of the time and worse than the projection 50% of the time. The Upside scenario was developed such that there is a 10% probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a 90% probability that it will perform worse. The Downside scenario was developed such that there is a 90% probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a 10% probability that it will perform worse. 

March 31, 2023 ACL 

The ACL as of March 31, 2023 was impacted by several factors, including higher period-end loan and lease balances and increases to specific reserves on individually evaluated commercial loans. The increase in period-end loan and lease balances was primarily driven by commercial and industrial loan growth and originations of point-of-sale solar energy installation loans. As of March 31, 2023, the Bancorp&#8217;s economic scenarios included estimates of the expected impacts of the changes in economic conditions caused by inflationary and rising interest rate pressures and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. At March 31, 2023, the Bancorp assigned an 80% probability weighting to the Baseline scenario and 10% to each the Upside and Downside scenarios. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The Baseline scenario assumed real GDP growth for the year ended 2023 at 1.3% with the forecast increasing to 2.2% and 2.7% in 2024 and 2025, respectively. The Baseline scenario also assumed an average unemployment rate of 3.5% for the year ended 2023, increasing to an average of 3.9% in the forecast for 2024 and modestly increasing to an average of 4.0% in 2025. Lastly, the Baseline scenario assumed continued increases to the target federal funds rate, peaking at 4.8% in 2023, and decreasing to an average of 4.2% and 3.2% in 2024 and 2025, respectively. The Upside scenario assumed a faster than anticipated resolution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict with related improvement to economic measures. The Upside scenario assumed that, on an average annual basis, the change in real GDP is 2.1% in 2023, increasing to 3.3% in 2024 and decreasing to an average of 2.5% in 2025. The Upside scenario also assumed an unemployment rate at an annual average of 3.1% and 3.2% in 2023 and 2024, respectively, and slightly increasing to 3.5% in 2025. In the Upside scenario, the forecast for the federal funds rate was consistent with the Baseline scenario. The Downside scenario included significant worsening of the Russia-Ukraine conflict resulting in continued inflation, causing the U.S. economy to fall into a recession in the second quarter of 2023. The Downside scenario assumed that real GDP declines throughout 2023 at an average of (0.4%) and throughout 2024 at an average of (0.3%), recovering to an average growth rate of 2.6% in 2025. The Downside scenario unemployment rate peaks at an average of 7.6% in 2024 and decreases to an average of 6.3% in 2025. In the Downside scenario, the forecast for the federal funds rate included higher increases than the Baseline scenario for 2023, followed by a decrease to an average target rate of 2.9% in 2024 and 1.2% in 2025. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s quantitative credit loss models are sensitive to changes in economic forecast assumptions over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the Downside scenario rather than using the probability-weighted three scenario approach would result in an increase in the quantitative ACL of approximately $2.2 billion. This sensitivity calculation only reflects the impact of changing the probability weighting of the scenarios in the quantitative credit loss models and excludes any additional considerations associated with the qualitative component of the ACL that might be warranted if probability weights were adjusted. 

At March 31, 2023, the Bancorp utilized its qualitative adjustment framework to incorporate consideration of two alternative macroeconomic scenarios in addition to its existing Baseline, Upside and Downside scenarios. These alternative scenarios depict potential macroeconomic outcomes from bank failures, including those that have recently occurred in the U.S.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

INTEREST RATE AND PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest rates. This risk primarily impacts the Bancorp&#8217;s income categories through changes in interest income on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and through fee items that are related to interest sensitive activities such as mortgage origination and servicing income and through earnings credits earned on commercial deposits that offset commercial deposit fees. Price risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from changes in the value of financial instruments and portfolios due to movements in interest rates, volatilities, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. Management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings. Interest rate risk may occur for any one or more of the following reasons: 

&#8226; Assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times; 

&#8226; Short-term and long-term market interest rates change by different amounts; or 

&#8226; The expected maturities of various assets or liabilities shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. 

In addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on NII and interest-sensitive fees, interest rates can impact earnings through their effect on loan and deposit demand, credit losses, mortgage origination volumes, the value of servicing rights and other sources of the Bancorp&#8217;s earnings. Changes in interest rates and other market factors can impact earnings through changes in the value of portfolios, if not appropriately hedged. Stability of the Bancorp&#8217;s net income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk and to a lesser extent price risk. Management continually reviews the Bancorp&#8217;s on- and off-balance sheet composition, earnings flows, and hedging strategies and models interest rate risk and price risk exposures, and possible actions to manage these risks, given numerous possible future interest rate and market factor scenarios. A series of policy limits and key risk indicators are employed to ensure that risks are managed within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance for interest rate risk and price risk. 

In addition to the traditional forms of interest rate risk discussed in this section, the Bancorp is exposed to interest rate risk associated with the retirement and replacement of LIBOR. For more information on the LIBOR transition, refer to the Overview section of MD&#38;A. 

The Commercial Banking and Wealth and Asset Management lines of business manage price risk for capital markets sales and trading activities related to their respective businesses. The Consumer and Small Business Banking line of business manages price risk for the origination and sale of conforming residential mortgage loans to government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. The Bancorp&#8217;s Treasury department manages interest rate risk and price risk for all other activities. Independent oversight is provided by ERM, and key risk indicators and Board-approved policy limits are used to ensure risks are managed within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Market Risk Management Committee, which includes senior management representatives and reports to the Corporate Credit Committee (accountable to the ERMC), provides oversight and monitors price risk for the capital markets sales and trading activities. The Bancorp&#8217;s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, provides oversight and monitors interest rate and price risks for Mortgage and Treasury activities. 

Net Interest Income Sensitivity 

The Bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an NII simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of NII to changes in interest rates. The model is based on contractual and estimated cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the Bancorp&#8217;s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and attrition rates of certain liabilities. The model also includes senior management&#8217;s projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the Bancorp as well as other pertinent assumptions. The NII simulation model does not represent a forecast of the Bancorp&#8217;s net interest income but is a tool utilized to assess the risk of the impact of changing market interest rates across a range of market interest rate environments. As a result, actual results will differ from simulated results for multiple reasons, which may include actual balance sheet composition differences, timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, deviations from projected customer behavioral assumptions as well as from changes in market conditions and management strategies. 

As of March 31, 2023, the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk exposure is governed by a risk framework that utilizes the change in NII over 12-month and 24-month horizons under parallel ramped increases and decreases in interest rates. Policy limits are utilized for scenarios assuming a 200 bps increase and a 200 bps decrease in interest rates over twelve months. The Bancorp routinely analyzes various potential and extreme scenarios, including parallel ramps and shocks as well as steepening and other non-parallel shifts in rates, to assess where risks to net interest income persist or develop as changes in the balance sheet and market rates evolve. Additionally, the Bancorp routinely evaluates its exposures to changes in the bases between interest rates. 

In order to recognize the risk of noninterest-bearing demand deposit balance migration or attrition in a rising interest rate environment, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling assumes additional attrition of approximately $800 million of demand deposit balances over a period of 24 months for each 100 bps increase in short-term market interest rates. Similarly, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling incorporates approximately $800 million of incremental growth in noninterest-bearing deposit balances over 24 months for each 100 bps decrease in short- 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

term market interest rates. The incremental balance attrition and growth are modeled to flow into and out of funding products that reprice in conjunction with short-term market rate changes. 

Another important deposit modeling assumption is the amount by which interest-bearing deposit rates will increase or decrease when market interest rates increase or decrease. This deposit repricing sensitivity is known as the beta, and it represents the expected amount by which the Bancorp&#8217;s interest-bearing deposit rates will change for a given change in short-term market rates. The Bancorp utilizes dynamic deposit beta models to adjust assumed repricing sensitivity depending on market rate levels. The dynamic beta models were developed utilizing the Bancorp&#8217;s performance during prior interest rate cycles. Through the current tightening cycle, the Bancorp&#8217;s actual cumulative deposit repricing has been slower than what was experienced in prior interest rate cycles, and as a result, the Bancorp has outperformed previous NII simulation expectations. Using the dynamic beta models, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity modeling assumes weighted-average rising-rate interest-bearing deposit betas at the end of the ramped parallel scenarios of 75% and 76%, for a 100 bps and 200 bps increase in rates, respectively. In the event of rate cuts, this approach assumes a weighted-average falling-rate interest-bearing deposit beta at the end of the ramped parallel scenarios of 63% and 62% for a 100 bps and 200 bps increase in rates, respectively. In falling rate scenarios, deposit rate floors are utilized to ensure modeled deposit rates will not become negative. NII simulation modeling assumes no lag between the timing of changes in market rates and the timing of deposit repricing despite such timing lags having occurred in prior rate cycles. In addition, modeled and forecasted deposit migration from low-beta deposit products to more rate-sensitive deposit products in the rising rate scenarios contribute additional beta of 10%-15%, resulting in an effective beta of approximately 85%-90% in the Bancorp&#8217;s baseline NII sensitivity profile. Future actual performance will be dependent on market conditions, the level of competition for deposits and the magnitude of continued interest rate increases. The Bancorp provides sensitivity analysis in Tables 50 and 51 for key assumptions related to its deposit modeling, including beta and DDA balance performance. 

The Bancorp continually evaluates the sensitivity of its interest rate risk measures to these important deposit modeling assumptions. The Bancorp also regularly monitors the sensitivity of other important modeling assumptions, such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawals on fixed-rate customer liabilities. 

The following table shows the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated NII sensitivity profile and ALCO policy limits as of: 

TABLE 49: Estimated NII Sensitivity Profile and ALCO Policy Limits March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 % Change in NII (FTE) ALCO Policy Limit % Change in NII (FTE) ALCO Policy Limit Change in Interest Rates (bps) 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months 12 Months 13-24 Months +200 Ramp over 12 months (3.11) &#160;% (5.16) (4.00) (6.00) 5.64 13.59 (4.00) (6.00) +100 Ramp over 12 months (1.46) (2.30) N/A N/A 3.45 8.61 N/A N/A

Table 49 presents the change in estimated net interest income for 12 month and 13-24 month horizons for alternative interest rate scenarios relative to the net interest income projection for a static rate scenario for those same time horizons. As previously mentioned, these numbers do not represent a forecast, but are instead risk measures that are monitored to evaluate the consolidated interest rate risk position of the Bancorp. At March 31, 2023, the Bancorp&#8217;s NII sensitivity in the rising-rate scenarios is negative in years one and two as interest expense is expected to increase more than interest income due to deposit repricing and balance migration estimates given the high interest rate environment. The Bancorp&#8217;s NII simulation projects an increase in year one and a slight decrease in year two NII under the parallel 200 bps ramp decrease in interest rates. In year one, the NII increase is driven by deposits repricing faster than assets as a result of positioning in securities with less near-term principal cash flows. Additionally, receive-fixed hedges have added significant protection from declining rates. In year two, NII declines driven by fixed-rate asset portfolios continuing to reprice lower while only being partially offset by liabilities continuing to reprice lower. The changes in the estimated NII sensitivity profile compared to March 31, 2022 were primarily attributable to significant deployment of cash and other short-term investments into long-term fixed-rate securities in 2022, combined with higher market interest rates driving higher expected betas. 

Tables 50 and 51 provide the sensitivity of the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated NII profile at March 31, 2023 to changes to certain deposit balance and deposit repricing sensitivity (beta) assumptions. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

(a) Applies a +/- 10% multiple on assumed betas. 

Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity 

The Bancorp also uses EVE as a measurement tool to govern and manage its interest rate risk exposure. Policy limits are utilized for scenarios assuming an instantaneous 200 bps increase and a 200 bps decrease in interest rates. Whereas the NII sensitivity analysis highlights the impact on forecasted NII on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) over one- and two-year time horizons, EVE is a point-in-time analysis of the economic sensitivity of current balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives. The EVE of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of all asset and net derivative cash flows less the discounted value of all liability cash flows. Due to this longer horizon, the sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk. EVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate any assumptions related to continued production or renewal activities used in the NII sensitivity analysis. As with the NII simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of existing balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis. Particularly important are assumptions driving loan and security prepayments and the expected balance attrition and pricing of indeterminate-lived deposits. 

The following table shows the Bancorp&#8217;s estimated EVE sensitivity profile as of: 

TABLE 52: Estimated EVE Sensitivity Profile March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 Change in Interest Rates (bps) % Change in EVE ALCO Policy Limit % Change in EVE ALCO Policy Limit +200 Shock (5.08) % (12.00) (3.63) (12.00) +100 Shock (2.11) N/A (1.46) N/A -25 Shock N/A N/A 0.16 (12.00) -100 Shock 1.02 &#160; N/A N/A N/A -200 Shock (0.84) (12.00) N/A N/A 

The EVE sensitivity is negative in both a +200 bps rising-rate scenario and a -200 bps falling-rate scenario at March 31, 2023. The changes in the estimated EVE sensitivity profile from March 31, 2022 were primarily related to the significant deployment of cash and other short-term investments into long-term fixed-rate securities, the execution of new forward-starting receive-fixed hedging transactions and increased deposit repricing betas. 

While an instantaneous shift in spot interest rates followed by forward projections is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure, the Bancorp believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (e.g., the current fiscal year). Further, EVE does not account for factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could mitigate or exacerbate the impact of changes in interest rates. The NII simulations and EVE analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage risk in response to actual changes in interest rates. 

The Bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to a static balance sheet forecast, LIBOR, SOFR, Prime Rate and other basis risks, yield curve twist risks and embedded options risks. In addition, the impacts on NII on an FTE basis and EVE of extreme changes in interest rates are modeled, wherein the Bancorp employs the use of yield curve shocks and environment-specific scenarios. 

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk 

An integral component of the Bancorp&#8217;s interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, forward starting interest rate swaps, options, swaptions and TBA securities. 

Tables 53 and 54 show all swap and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing the Bancorp&#8217;s exposures to the variability of interest rates. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index, to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate or to hedge forecasted transactions for the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as the Bancorp adjusts its broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For further information, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Additionally, as part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its residential mortgage banking activities, the Bancorp enters into forward contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically hedge IRLCs that are also considered free-standing derivatives. The Bancorp economically hedges its exposure to residential mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward contracts and mortgage options as well. See the Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Price Risk section for the discussion of the use of derivatives to economically hedge this exposure. 

The Bancorp also enters into derivative contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge market risks assumed in interest rate derivative contracts with commercial customers. Generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the Bancorp from market volatility. Credit risk arises from the possible inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts, which the Bancorp minimizes through collateral arrangements, approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of interest rate volatility and potential future exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Price Risk 

The fair value of the residential MSR portfolio was $1.7 billion at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of refinancing, the total value of existing servicing rights declines because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans. For further information on the significant drivers and components of the valuation adjustments on MSRs, refer to the Noninterest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&#38;A. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of its MSR portfolio as a result of changing interest rates. The Bancorp may adjust its hedging strategy to reflect its assessment of the composition of its MSR portfolio, the cost of hedging and the anticipated effectiveness of the hedges given the economic environment. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on servicing rights and the instruments used to hedge price risk on MSRs. 

Foreign Currency Risk 

The Bancorp may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign denominated loans. The derivatives are classified as free-standing instruments with the revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other noninterest income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of the Bancorp&#8217;s foreign denominated loans at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. The Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of price risk from interest rate derivative contracts entered into with commercial customers, the Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven foreign exchange activity. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of currency volatility and potential future exposure on these contracts, counterparty credit approvals and country limits performed by independent risk management. 

Commodity Risk 

The Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to commodity price fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of foreign exchange and price risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven commodity activity. The Bancorp may also offset this risk with exchange-traded commodity contracts. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of commodity volatility and potential future exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 

The goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals and other contractual obligations. Mitigating liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and investment securities, maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent growth in core deposits. A summary of certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts is included in Note 17 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s Treasury department manages funding and liquidity based on point-in-time metrics as well as forward-looking projections, which incorporate different sources and uses of funds under base and stress scenarios. Liquidity risk is monitored and managed by the Treasury department with independent oversight provided by ERM, and a series of Policy Limits and Key Risk Indicators are established to ensure risks are managed within the Bancorp&#8217;s risk tolerance. The Bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing, which assesses the liquidity needs under varying market conditions, time horizons, asset growth rates and other events. The contingency plan provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. The contingency plan also outlines the Bancorp&#8217;s response to various levels of liquidity stress and actions that should be taken during various scenarios. 

Liquidity risk is monitored and managed for both Fifth Third Bancorp and its subsidiaries. The Bancorp receives substantially all of its liquidity from dividends from its subsidiaries, primarily Fifth Third Bank, National Association. Subsidiary dividends are supplemented with term debt to enable the Bancorp to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its cash obligations, including debt service and scheduled maturities, common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to subsidiaries and other planned capital actions in the form of share repurchases. Liquidity resources are more limited at the Bancorp, making its liquidity position more susceptible to market disruptions. Bancorp liquidity is assessed using a cash coverage horizon, ensuring the entity maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a period of sustained market disruption while meeting its anticipated obligations over an extended stressed horizon. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, monitors and manages liquidity and funding risk within Board-approved policy limits. In addition to the risk management activities of ALCO, the Bancorp has a liquidity risk management function as part of ERM that provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management. 

Sources of Funds 

The Bancorp&#8217;s primary sources of funds relate to cash flows from loan and lease repayments, payments from securities related to sales and maturities, the sale or securitization of loans and leases and funds generated by core deposits, in addition to the use of public and private debt offerings. 

Of the $50.7 billion o f securities in the Bancorp&#8217;s available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio at March 31, 2023, $4.2 billion in principal and interest is expected to be received in the next 12 months and an additional $5.5 billion is expected to be received in the next 13 to 24 months. For further information on the Bancorp&#8217;s securities portfolio, refer to the Investment Securities subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A. 

Asset-driven liquidity is provided by the Bancorp&#8217;s ability to pledge, sell or securitize loans and leases. In order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity, the Bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of interest-sensitive assets. A majority of the long-term, fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to FHLMC or FNMA guidelines are sold for cash upon origination. Additional assets such as certain other residential mortgage loans, certain commercial loans and leases, home equity loans, automobile loans and other consumer loans (including point-of-sale solar energy installation loans) are also capable of being securitized or sold. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Bancorp sold loans and leases totalin g $1.3 billion and $3.5 billion, res pectively. For further information, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Core deposits have historically provided the Bancorp with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. The Bancorp&#8217;s average core deposits and average shareholders&#8217; equity funde d 85% and 91% of its average total assets for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition to core deposit funding, the Bancorp also accesses a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources, which include the use of the FHLB system. Management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs. 

In June of 2022, the Board of Directors authorized $5.0 billion of debt or other securities for issuance, of which $3.0 billion of debt or other securities were available for issuance a s of March 31, 2023. The Bancorp is authorized to file any necessary registration statements with the SEC to permit ready access to the public securities markets; however, access to these markets may depend on market conditions. 

As of March 31, 2023, the Bank&#8217;s global bank note program had a borrowing capacit y of $25.0 billion , of which $20.9 billion was available for issuance. Additionally, at March 31, 2023, the Bank had approximately $59.5 billion of borrowing capacity available through secured borrowing sources, including the FRB (through the Bank Term Funding Program and the Discount Window) and the FHLB. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Current Liquidity Position 

The Bancorp maintains a strong liquidity profile driven by strong core deposit funding and approximately $100 billion in current available liquidity. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&#38;A for more information regarding the Bancorp&#8217;s deposit portfolio characteristics. The Bancorp is managing liquidity prudently in the current environment and maintains a liquidity profile focused on core deposit and stable long-term funding sources, while supplementing with a variety of secured and unsecured wholesale funding sources across the maturity spectrum, which allows for the effective management of concentration and rollover risk. The Bancorp&#8217;s investment portfolio remains highly concentrated in liquid and readily marketable instruments and is a significant source of secured borrowing capacity. As part of its liquidity management activities, the Bancorp maintains collateral at its secured funding providers to ensure immediate availability of funding. Additionally, the Bancorp executes periodic test trades to assess the operational processes associated with its secured funding sources, including the Discount Window and the newly created Bank Term Funding Program. 

As of March 31, 2023, the Bancorp (parent company) has sufficient liquidity to meet contractual obligations and all preferred and common dividends without accessing the capital markets or receiving upstream dividends from the Bank subsidiary f or 21 months . 

Credit Ratings 

The cost and availability of financing to the Bancorp and Bank are impacted by its credit ratings. A downgrade to the Bancorp&#8217;s or Bank&#8217;s credit ratings could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its borrowing costs, thereby adversely impacting the Bancorp&#8217;s or Bank&#8217;s financial condition and liquidity. Key factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong credit quality, strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources, in addition to disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. 

The Bancorp&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s credit ratings are summarized in Table 55. The ratings reflect the ratings agency&#8217;s view on the Bancorp&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s capacity to meet financial commitments.* 

* As an investor, you should be aware that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

Management regularly reviews the Bancorp&#8217;s capital levels to help ensure it is appropriately positioned under various operating environments. The Bancorp has established a Capital Committee which is responsible for making capital plan recommendations to management. These recommendations are reviewed by the ERMC and the annual capital plan is approved by the Board of Directors. The Capital Committee is responsible for execution and oversight of the capital actions of the capital plan. 

Regulatory Capital Ratios 

The Basel III Final Rule sets minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as defines the measure of &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; for insured depository institutions. 

TABLE 56: Prescribed Capital Ratios Minimum Well-Capitalized CET1 capital: Fifth Third Bancorp 4.50 &#160;% N/A Fifth Third Bank, National Association

4.00 5.00 

The Bancorp is subject to the stress capital buffer requirement and must maintain capital ratios above its buffered minimum (regulatory minimum plus stress capital buffer) in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The FRB uses the supervisory stress test to determine the Bancorp&#8217;s stress capital buffer, subject to a floor of 2.5%. The Bancorp&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement has been 2.5% since the introduction of this framework and was most recently affirmed as part of the FRB&#8217;s 2022 supervisory stress test with an effective date of October 1, 2022. The Bancorp&#8217;s capital ratios have exceeded the stress capital buffer requirement for all periods presented. 

The Bancorp adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 and elected the five-year transition phase-in option for the impact of CECL on regulatory capital with its regulatory filings as of March 31, 2020. The Bancorp&#8217;s modified CECL transition amount became subject to the phase-out provisions of the final rule on January 1, 2022, and will be fully phased-out by January 1, 2025. The impact of the modified CECL transition amount on the Bancorp&#8217;s regulatory capital at March 31, 2023 was an increase in capital of approximately $ 249 million. On a fully phased-in basis, the Bancorp&#8217;s CET1 ratio would be reduced by 13 bps as of March 31, 2023. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The following table summarizes the Bancorp&#8217;s capital ratios as of:

(c) Regulatory capital ratios as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are calculated pursuant to the five-year transition provision option to phase in the effects of CECL on regulatory capital. 

Capital Planning 

In 2011, the FRB adopted the capital plan rule, which requires BHCs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans to the FRB for review. Under the rule, these capital plans must include detailed descriptions of the following: the BHC&#8217;s internal processes for assessing capital adequacy; the policies governing capital actions such as common stock issuances, dividends and share repurchases; and all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon. Furthermore, each BHC must report to the FRB the results of stress tests conducted by the BHC under a number of scenarios that assess the sources and uses of capital under baseline and stressed economic conditions. 

Under the Enhanced Prudential Standards tailoring rules, the Bancorp is subject to Category IV standards, under which the Bancorp is no longer required to file semi-annual, company-run stress tests with the FRB and publicly disclose the results. However, the Bancorp is required to develop and maintain a capital plan approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis. As an institution subject to Category IV standards, the Bancorp is subject to the FRB&#8217;s supervisory stress tests every two years, the Board capital plan rule and certain FR Y-14 reporting requirements. The supervisory stress tests are forward-looking quantitative evaluations of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on the Bancorp&#8217;s capital. The Bancorp became subject to Category IV standards on December 31, 2019, and the requirements outlined above apply to the stress test cycle that started on January 1, 2020. The Bancorp was not subject to the 2023 supervisory stress test conducted by the FRB, but submitted the Board-approved capital plan and information contained in Schedule C - Regulatory Capital Instruments as required by the April 5, 2023 deadline. 

Dividend Policy and Stock Repurchase Program 

The Bancorp&#8217;s common stock dividend policy and stock repurchase program reflect its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need to maintain adequate capital levels, the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends and the need to comply with safe and sound banking practices as well as meet regulatory requirements and expectations. The Bancorp declared dividends per common share of $0.33 and $0.30 f or the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively . Pursuant to the Bancorp&#8217;s Board-approved capital plan, during the first quarter of 2023, the Bancorp entered into and settled an accelerated share repurchase transaction in the amount of $200 million. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on share repurchase activity. The Bancorp does not currently expect to repurchase any common stock, except pursuant to employee compensation plans, during the second quarter of 2023. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)
