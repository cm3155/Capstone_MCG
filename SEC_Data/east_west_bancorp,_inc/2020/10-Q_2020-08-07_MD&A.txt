Company Overview 

East West is a bank holding company incorporated in Delaware on August 26, 1998 and is registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 Global Pandemic 

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) pandemic has caused significant, unprecedented disruption around the world, as well as economic and financial market deterioration, which did not exist at the beginning of the year. The recession resulting from government-mandated closures of certain businesses and &#8220;stay-at-home&#8221; orders has significantly impacted businesses, investments in those businesses and consumer spending, and heightened volatility in the global financial markets. These economic and operating conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have created financial difficulties for many of the Company&#8217;s commercial and consumer customers and, as a result, some borrowers may not be able to satisfy their obligations to us. As many of the Company&#8217;s loans are secured by real estate, a potential decline in the real estate markets could also negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and the credit quality of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the provision for credit losses was elevated during the second quarter of 2020. 

Regulatory Developments Relating to COVID-19 Pandemic 

Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act &#8212; The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) was enacted on March 27, 2020 to address the economic impact to individuals and businesses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the CARES Act, various initiatives to protect individuals, businesses and local economies, such as the Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) and the Main Street Lending Program were established in an effort to lessen the impact of COVID-19 on consumers and businesses. As part of our commitment to support our customers, t he Bank participated as a lender in the PPP. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company funded over 7,200 SBA 7(a) approved PPP loans for customers with an outstanding loan balance totaling $1.75 billion as of June 30, 2020. The SBA guarantees 100% of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers and if used for qualified expenditures, the PPP loans are forgivable. These loans are included in our commercial and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;) portfolio, have an interest rate of 1% and a maturity of two or five years. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) has established the PPP Liquidity Facility (&#8220;PPPLF&#8221;) to enable Federal Reserve Banks (&#8220;FRB&#8221;) to extend credit to financial institutions that originate PPP loans, while taking the PPP loans as collateral. As of June 30, 2020, we have drawn down $1.43 billion from the Federal Reserve PPPLF and pledged the same amount in PPP loans as collateral. The Bank is also a participating lender in the Main Street Lending Program, which was established by the Federal Reserve system, to support lending to small and medium-sized businesses and nonprofit organizations that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In addition, the CARES Act requires mortgage servicers to grant, on a borrower&#8217;s request, forbearance for up to 180 days (which can be extended for an additional 180 days) on a federally-backed single-family mortgage loan or forbearance up to 30 days (which can be extended for two additional 30-day periods) on a federally-backed multi-family mortgage loan when the borrowers experience financial hardship due to COVID-19. 

Loan Modifications &#8212; The CARES Act also includes an option for financial institutions to suspend the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requirements and regulatory determinations for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic that would otherwise be categorized as a troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;) from March 1, 2020, through the earlier of 60 days after the date of the COVID-19 National Emergency comes to an end or December 31, 2020. On April 7, 2020, the federal banking regulators issued the &#8220;Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customer Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised)&#8221; (the &#8220;Interagency Statement&#8221;) . The Interagency Statement also provides financial institutions the option to suspend the application of the TDR accounting guidance for short-term modifications (i.e., six months or less) made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current at the time of modification. Given that nonaccrual loans are more heavily risk-weighted for capital purposes, this TDR relief allows a capital benefit in the form of reduced risk-weighted assets since the aging of such loans were frozen at the time of modification. We are granting loan modifications to our customers in the form of maturity extensions, payment deferrals and forbearance. For a summary of the loans that we have modified in response to COVID-19, please refer to Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Credit Risk Management in this Form 10-Q. 

Regulatory Capital &#8212; On March 31, 2020, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay the effects of current expected credit losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period (&#8220;CECL Capital Transition&#8221;). The Company has elected to apply the CECL Capital Transition during the first quarter of 2020. 

Reserve Requirements &#8212; On March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent, eliminating the reserve requirement for all depository institutions, an action that provides liquidity in the banking system to support lending to households and businesses. 

Our Response to COVID-19 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been working diligently to protect employee safety while continuing to carry out our role as a provider of critical and essential services to the public. We have taken comprehensive steps to help our employees, customers and communities as follows: 

&#8226; Employees: 

For employees with jobs that are required to be performed on-site, we have taken significant actions to ensure employee safety by adopting social distancing measures, implementing an enhanced cleaning program and installing plexiglass panels and requiring temperature screenings and the wearing of masks for all employees physically at on-site locations. We have further provided support to our employees by granting an increase in flexibility by temporarily adjusting vacation policies. 

&#8226; Customers: 

We offered assistance to our commercial, consumer and small business clients affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes payment deferrals, pausing foreclosures on certain residential mortgage loans and participation in the SBA PPP and the Main Street Lending Program under the CARES Act as discussed above. We intend to evaluate participation in additional new government-sponsored programs, as they are established. 

Given the continuous unprecedented uncertainty and rapidly evolving socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, t he Company continues to closely monitor its impacts on the Company&#8217;s business and loan portfolio. The pandemic had a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s second quarter and first half of 2020 provision for credit losses. Although we are uncertain of the full magnitude and duration of the business and economic impact from the unprecedented public health efforts to contain and combat the spread of COVID-19, we could experience material declines in revenues, profitability and/or cash flows in one or more periods in 2020, compared to the corresponding prior-year periods and compared to our expectations at the beginning of the 2020 fiscal year. Further discussion of the potential impacts on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic is provided below under Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors in this Form 10-Q .

Financial Highlights 

Noteworthy items about the Company&#8217;s performance for the second quarter and first half of 2020 included: 

&#8226; Earnings: Second quarter 2020 net income was $99.4 million or $0.70 in diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;), compared with second quarter of 2019 net income of $150.4 million or diluted EPS of $1.03, a decrease of $51.0 million or 34% in net income. Net income for the first half of 2020 was $244.2 million or $1.70 in diluted EPS, compared with net income of $314.4 million or $2.15 in diluted EPS for the first half of 2019, a decrease of $70.2 million or 22% in net income. These decreases in both periods were primarily due to higher provision for credit losses resulting from the deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and outlook as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the recently adopted CECL methodology, and lower net interest income resulting from lower interest rates, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense. Provision for credit losses of $176.3 million for the first half of 2020 increased by 322% compared to the same period a year ago. 

&#8226; Adjusted Earnings: There were no adjustments for non-recurring items during the second quarter and first half of 2020 that affected non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the second quarter of 2019 were $180.5 million and $1.24, respectively. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first half of 2019 were $349.4 million and $2.39, respectively. During the first and second quarters of 2019, the Company recorded a $7.0 million pre-tax impairment charge and reversed $30.1 million of certain previously claimed tax credits related to the DC Solar, respectively. Refer to reconciliations of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Supplemental Information &#8212; Explanation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-Q. 

&#8226; Revenue: Revenue, or the sum of net interest income before provision for credit losses and noninterest income, was $402.4 million for the second quarter of 2020, compared with $420.1 million for the second quarter of 2019, a decrease of $17.7 million or 4%. Revenue for the first half of 2020 was $819.2 million, compared with $824.7 million for the first half of 2019, a decrease of $5.5 million or 1%. These decreases were primarily due to lower net interest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest income. 

&#8226; Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin: Second quarter 2020 net interest income was $343.8 million, compared with second quarter 2019 net interest income of $367.3 million, a decrease of $23.5 million or 6%. Second quarter 2020 net interest margin was 3.04%, a 69 basis point decrease from 3.73% for the second quarter of 2019. Net interest income for the first half of 2020 was $706.5 million, compared with $729.8 million for the first half of 2019, a decrease of $23.3 million or 3%. Net interest margin was 3.24% for the first half of 2020, a decrease of 52 basis points from 3.76% for the first half of 2019. The decreases in the net interest income and net interest margin reflected lower interest rates year-over-year, including a cumulative 225 basis point reduction of the federal funds target rate from the second half of 2019 through the second quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Operating Efficiency: Efficiency ratio, calculated as noninterest expense divided by revenue, was 46.64% and 42.29% for the second quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The efficiency ratio was 44.75% for the first half of 2020, compared with 44.21% for the first half of 2019. Adjusting for the amortization of tax credit and other investments, amortization of core deposit intangibles, and repurchase agreements&#8217; extinguishment cost, non-GAAP efficiency ratio for the second quarter of 2020 was 38.09%, a six basis point increase from 38.03% for the second quarter of 2019. For the first half of 2020, non-GAAP efficiency ratio was 38.31%, a 57 basis point improvement from 38.88% for the first half of 2019. For additional detail, see the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Supplemental Information &#8212; Explanation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-Q. 

&#8226; Tax: Income tax expense was $12.9 million and the effective tax rate was 11.5% for the second quarter of 2020, compared with income tax expense of $72.8 million and an effective tax rate of 32.6% for the second quarter of 2019. Income tax expense was $32.1 million and the effective tax rate was 11.6% for the first half of 2020, compared with income tax expense of $103.9 million and an effective tax rate of 24.8% for the first half of 2019. 

&#8226; Profitability: ROA for the second quarters of 2020 and 2019 were 0.83% and 1.45%, respectively. ROA for the first half of 2020 and 2019 were 1.06% and 1.54%, respectively. ROE for the second quarters of 2020 and 2019 were 8.02% and 12.88%, respectively. ROE for the first half of 2020 and 2019 were 9.82% and 13.75%, respectively. Adjusting for non-recurring items related to DC Solar which occurred in 2019, non-GAAP ROA and non-GAAP ROE for the second quarter of 2019 were 1.74% and 15.45%, respectively. Non-GAAP ROA and non-GAAP ROE for the first half of 2019 were 1.71% and 15.28%, respectively. For additional detail, see the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Supplemental Information &#8212; Explanation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-Q.) 

&#8226; Loans: Total loans were $37.23 billion as of June 30, 2020, an increase of $2.45 billion or 7% from $34.78 billion as of December 31, 2019. Loan growth was well-diversified across each of the Company&#8217;s major loan portfolios, with the strongest growth from C&#38;I, driven by PPP loan funding, commercial real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) and single-family residential loans. 

&#8226; Deposits: Total deposits were $40.67 billion as of June 30, 2020, an increase of $3.35 billion or 9% from $37.32 billion as of December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily driven by growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and money market accounts, partially offset by a decrease in time deposits. 

&#8226; Asset Quality Metrics: The allowance for loan losses was $632.1 million or 1.70% of loans held-for-investment, as of June 30, 2020, compared with $358.3 million or 1.03% of loans held-for-investment, as of December 31, 2019. The increase in the allowance for loan losses was primarily due to the deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and outlook as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; and the adoption of ASU 2016-13, which increased the allowance for loan losses by $125.2 million. Nonperforming assets were $202.2 million or 0.41% of total assets, as of June 30, 2020, an increase from $121.5 million, or 0.27% of total assets, as of December 31, 2019. Second quarter 2020 net charge-offs were $19.2 million, or an annualized 0.21% of average loans held-for-investment, compared with $7.6 million, or an annualized 0.09% of average loans held-for-investment for the second quarter of 2019. For the first half of 2020, net charge-offs were $20.1 million or annualized 0.11% of average loans held-for-investment, compared with $22.1 million or annualized 0.14% of average loans held-for-investment for the first half of 2019. 

&#8226; Capital Levels: Our capital levels are strong. As of June 30, 2020, all of the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s regulatory capital ratios were well above the regulatory requirements to be considered well-capitalized. See Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Balance Sheet Analysis &#8212; Regulatory Capital and Ratios in this Form 10-Q for more information regarding capital. On March 3, 2020, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to buy back up to $500.0 million of the Company&#8217;s common stock. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company repurchased 4,471,682 shares at an average price of $32.64 per share and a total cost of $146.0 million. There were no share repurchases during the second quarter of 2020 or the full year 2019. 

&#8226; Cash Dividends: The quarterly cash common stock dividend for both the second quarters of 2020 and 2019 was $0.275 per share. Cash dividends of $39.5 million during the second quarter of 2020 and $79.9 million the first half of 2020 were retuned to stockholders, compared with $40.5 million and $74.3 million during the same periods in 2019, respectively. 

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income 

The Company&#8217;s primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by several factors, including changes in average balances and composition of interest-earning assets and funding sources, market interest rate fluctuations and the slope of the yield curve, repricing characteristics and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, volume of noninterest-bearing sources of funds, and asset quality. 

Second quarter 2020 net interest income was $343.8 million, a decrease of $23.5 million or 6%, compared with $367.3 million for the second quarter of 2019. For the first half of 2020, net interest income was $706.5 million, a decrease of $23.3 million or 3%, compared with $729.8 million for the first half of 2019. The decreases in net interest income were due to a decrease in interest-earning asset yields which reflected the drop in the average Prime and London Interbank Offered Rates (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;), partially offset by decreases in the cost of funds. Second quarter 2020 net interest margin was 3.04%, a 69 basis point decrease from 3.73% for the second quarter of 2019. For the first half of 2020, net interest margin was 3.24%, a 52 basis point decrease from 3.76% for the first half of 2019. 

The average loan yield for the second quarter of 2020 was 3.98%, a 130 basis point decrease from 5.28% for the second quarter of 2019. For the first half of 2020, the average loan yield was 4.34%, a 95 basis point decrease from 5.29% for the first half of 2019. These decreases, compared with the same periods in 2019, reflected materially lower interest rates, which resulted from a cumulative 225 basis point reduction of the federal funds target rate. Approximately 65% and 70% of loans were comprised of variable-rate or hybrid loans that were in the adjustable rate period as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Second quarter of 2020 average loans were $37.14 billion, an increase of $4.16 billion or 13% from $32.98 billion for the second quarter of 2019. For the first half of 2020, average loans were $36.15 billion, an increase of $3.45 billion or 11% from $32.70 billion for the first half of 2019. The year-over-year increase stemmed from broad-based growth across CRE, C&#38;I, and single-family residential loans. 

Second quarter of 2020 average interest-earning assets was $45.41 billion, an increase of $5.95 billion or 15% from $39.46 billion for the second quarter of 2019. This was primarily due to increases of $4.16 billion in average loans and $1.17 billion in AFS debt securities. For the first half of 2020, average interest-earning assets was $43.89 billion, an increase of $4.78 billion or 12% from $39.11 billion for first half of 2019. This was primarily due to increases of $3.45 billion in average loans and $900.4 million in AFS debt securities. 

Deposits are an important source of funds and impact both net interest income and net interest margin. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits totaled $13.53 billion for the second quarter of 2020, compared with $10.24 billion for the second quarter of 2019, an increase of $3.29 billion or 32%. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits comprised 34% and 29% of average total deposits for the second quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits was $12.33 billion for the first half of 2020, compared with $10.16 billion for the first half of 2019, an increase of $2.17 billion or 21%. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits made up 32% and 29% of average total deposits for first half of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Average interest-bearing deposits of $26.37 billion for the second quarter of 2020 increased by $1.28 billion or 5% from $25.09 billion for the second quarter of 2019. Average interest-bearing deposits of $26.36 billion for the first half of 2020 increased by $1.39 billion or 6%, from $24.97 billion for the first half of 2019. 

The average cost of funds was 0.53% for the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of 66 basis points from 1.19% for the second quarter of 2019. For the first half of 2020, the average cost of funds was 0.71%, a decrease of 46 basis points from 1.17% for the first half of 2019. The decreases in the average cost of funds reflected the cumulative 225 basis point reduction of the target federal funds rate from the second half of 2019 through the second quarter of 2020. The average cost of deposits was 0.47% for the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of 64 basis points from 1.11% for the second quarter of 2019. The average cost of deposits was 0.64% for the first half of 2020, a decrease of 45 basis points from 1.09% for the first half of 2019. 

The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.71% for the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of 86 basis points from 1.57% for the second quarter of 2019. For the first half of 2020, the average cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 59 basis points to 0.94%, from 1.53% for the first half of 2019. Other sources of funding included in the calculation of the average cost of funds consist of short-term borrowings, FHLB advances, repurchase agreements and long-term debt. 

The Company utilizes various tools to manage interest rate risk. Refer to Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Market Risk Management in this Form 10-Q.

Noninterest income comprised 15% and 14% of total revenue for the second quarter and the first half of 2020, respectively, compared with 13% and 12% for the second quarter and the first half of 2019, respectively. Second quarter 2020 noninterest income was $58.6 million, an increase of $5.9 million or 11%, compared with $52.8 million for the same period in 2019. This increase was primarily due to increases in gains on sale of AFS debt securities and lending fees, partially offset by decreases in interest rate contracts and other derivative income, foreign exchange income and other income. First half 2020 noninterest income was $112.7 million, an increase of $17.8 million or 19%, compared with $94.9 million for the first half of 2019. This increase was primarily due to increases in gains on sale of AFS debt securities and lending fees, partially offset by decreases in other income and interest rate contracts and other derivative income. The following discussion provides the composition of the major changes in noninterest income: 

Lending fees increased by $5.5 million or 34% to $21.9 million for the second quarter of 2020, and increased by $6.3 million or 20% to $37.7 million for the first half of 2020, as compared with the same periods in 2019. These increases primarily reflected an increase in the valuation of warrants received as part of lending relationships. 

Foreign exchange income decreased by $2.7 million or 37% to $4.6 million for the second quarter of 2020, and was essentially flat at $12.4 million for the first half of 2020, as compared with the same periods in 2019. The decrease in the second quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by the unfavorable revaluation of certain foreign currency-denominated balance sheet items and a decrease in customer-driven transactions. 

Interest rate contracts and other derivative income decreased $4.3 million or 41% to $6.1 million for the second quarter of 2020, and decreased by $434 thousand or 3% to $13.2 million for the first half of 2020, as compared with the same periods in 2019. These decreases primarily reflected the impact of negative credit valuation adjustments due to higher loss probabilities for borrowers impacted by COVID-19. 

Gains on sales of AFS debt securities increased by $8.2 million or 566% to $9.6 million for the second quarter of 2020, and increased by $8.2 million or 271% to $11.2 million for the first half of 2020, as compared with the same periods in 2019. These increases were primarily driven by $131.6 million in sales of municipal bonds during the second quarter of 2020. 

Other income decreased by $1.8 million or 57% to $1.3 million for the second quarter of 2020, and decreased by $583 thousand or 11% to $4.5 million for the first half of 2020, as compared with the same periods in 2019. These decreases primarily reflected losses recognized on the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance policies. 

Noninterest Expense 

The following table presents the components of noninterest expense for the second quarters and first half of 2020 and 2019: 

($ in thousands) Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 % Change 2020 2019 % Change Compensation and employee benefits $ 96,955 &#160; $ 100,531 &#160; (4) % $ 198,915 &#160; $ 202,830 &#160; (2) % Occupancy and equipment expense 16,217 &#160; 17,362 &#160; (7) % 33,293 &#160; 34,680 &#160; (4) % Deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments

$ 187,696 &#160; $ 177,663 &#160; 6 % $ 366,572 &#160; $ 364,585 &#160; 1 % 

Second quarter 2020 noninterest expense was $187.7 million, an increase of $10.0 million or 6%, compared with $177.7 million for the same period in 2019. This increase was primarily due to repurchase agreements&#8217; extinguishment cost and the amortization of tax credit and other investments, partially offset by decreases in compensation and employee benefits and other operating expenses. First half 2020 noninterest expense was $366.6 million, an increase of $2.0 million or 1%, compared with $364.6 million for the first half of 2019. This increase was primarily due to repurchase agreements&#8217; extinguishment cost and additional data processing expense, partially offset by decreases in other operating expenses and compensation and employee benefits. 

Compensation and employee benefits decreased by $3.6 million or 4% to $97.0 million for the second quarter of 2020, and decreased by $3.9 million or 2% to $198.9 million for the first half of 2020, as compared with the same periods in 2019. These decreases were primarily driven by increased deferred loan costs as a result of increased loan originations and a reduction in bonus accruals, partially offset by annual merit increases and greater temporary staffing costs. 

Data processing increased by $1.0 million or 29% to $4.5 million for the second quarter of 2020, and increased by $1.7 million or 26% to $8.3 million for the first half of 2020, as compared with the same periods in 2019. These increases were primarily driven by an increase in electronic data processing fees. 

Other operating expense primarily consists of telecommunications and postage, loan related expenses, charitable contributions, marketing, travel, and other miscellaneous expense categories. Other operating expense decreased by $3.4 million or 15% to $19.2 million for the second quarter of 2020, and decreased by $4.6 million or 10% to $40.4 million for the first half of 2020, as compared with the same periods in the 2019. These decreases were primarily driven by decreases in travel, marketing and other miscellaneous expense categories, largely due to COVID-19. 

Amortization of tax credit and other investments increased $8.0 million or 48% to $24.8 million for the second quarter of 2020, compared with the second quarter of 2019, and increased by $440 thousand or 1% to $42.1 million for the first half of 2020, as compared with the same periods in 2019. These increases were mainly attributable to a reduction in value for investments accounted for under the equity method and an increase in amortization expense from tax credit investments placed in service in 2020, partially offset by a decrease in impairment charges. In the first quarter of 2019, the Company fully wrote off the tax credit investments related to DC Solar and recorded a $7.0 million impairment charge. In the second quarter of 2019, the Company recorded $2.9 million of other-than-temporary impairment (&#8220;OTTI&#8221;) charges related to a historic tax credit investment and a Community Reinvestment Act investment. In comparison, $624 thousand and $474 thousand of impairment charges net of recoveries were recorded in the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively. 

During the second quarter of 2020, the Company prepaid $150.0 million of repurchase agreements and incurred a debt extinguishment cost of $8.7 million. No such expense was incurred in the second quarter and first half of 2019.

The income tax expense was $12.9 million and the effective tax rate was 11.5% in the second quarter of 2020, compared with an income tax expense of $72.8 million and an effective tax rate of 32.6% for the same period in 2019. The income tax expense was $32.1 million and the effective tax rate was 11.6% in the first half of 2020, compared with an income tax expense of $103.9 million and an effective tax rate of 24.8% for the same period in 2019. The higher effective tax rates of 32.6% and 24.8% during the second quarter and first half of 2019, respectively, were primarily due to $30.1 million of additional income tax expense recorded to reverse certain previously claimed tax credits related to the Company&#8217;s investment in DC Solar. Excluding this $30.1 million of additional income tax expense, non-GAAP effective tax rates for the second quarter and first half of 2019 were 19.1% and 17.6%, respectively. For more details, see reconciliations of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Supplemental Information &#8212; Explanation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-Q . The year-over-year decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the decreases in pre-tax income during the second quarter and first half of 2020, as compared with the same periods of 2019, combined with a year-over-year increase in tax credits recognized from investments in renewable energy and solar tax credit projects. 

Operating Segment Results 

The Company organizes its operations into three reportable operating segments: (1) Consumer and Business Banking; (2) Commercial Banking; and (3) Other. These segments are defined by the type of customers served and the related products and services provided. The segments reflect how financial information is currently evaluated by management. For additional description of the Company&#8217;s internal management reporting process, including the segment cost allocation methodology, see Note 15 &#8212; Business Segments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Net interest income before provision for credit losses of each segment represents the difference between actual interest income earned on loans and interest expense paid on customer deposits of the segment, adjusted for funding charges for loans or funding credits for deposits through the Company&#8217;s internal funds transfer pricing (&#8220;FTP&#8221;) process. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company enhanced its FTP methodology related to deposits by setting a minimum floor rate for the FTP credits for deposits in consideration of the flattened and inverted yield curve. This methodology has been retrospectively applied to the segment financial results for the second quarter and first half of 2019.

Consumer and Business Banking 

The Consumer and Business Banking segment primarily provides financial products and services to consumer and commercial customers through the Company&#8217;s domestic branch network. This segment offers consumer and commercial deposits, mortgage and home equity loans, and other products and services. It also originates commercial loans for small and medium-sized enterprises through the Company&#8217;s branch network. Other products and services provided by this segment include wealth management, treasury management and foreign exchange services. 

The Consumer and Business Banking segment reported net income of $38.1 million for the second quarter of 2020, compared with $78.7 million for the same period in 2019. The decrease in segment net income of $40.6 million or 52% was primarily due to a decrease in net interest income before provision for credit losses. 

Second quarter 2020 net interest income before provision for credit losses for this segment was $124.9 million, a decrease of $56.0 million or 31%, compared with $180.9 million for the same period in 2019. Interest income earned on loans decreased by 3%, driven by a decrease in average loan yields, partially offset by average loan growth; interest expense paid on deposits decreased by 52%, driven by a decline in the average cost of deposits; FTP funding charges assessed for loans decreased, reflecting a decline in the loans FTP rate, and FTP credits received for deposits also decreased, reflecting a decline in the deposits FTP rate. Combined, these factors contributed to a 31% decrease in segment net interest income before provision for credit losses, with the largest driver of the unfavorable result being lower FTP credits received for deposits. 

Second quarter 2020 average loans for this segment were $12.01 billion, an increase of $1.48 billion or 14% from $10.53 billion for the same period in 2019, primarily driven by an increase in single-family residential portfolio. Second quarter 2020 average deposits for this segment were $27.00 billion, an increase of $1.99 billion or 8% from $25.01 billion for the same period in 2019, primarily driven by increases in noninterest-bearing demand and money market deposits. 

The Consumer and Business Banking segment reported net income of $91.3 million for the first half of 2020, compared with $155.9 million for the same period in 2019. The decrease in segment net income of $64.6 million or 41% was p rimarily due to a decrease in net interest income before provision for credit losses. 

First half 2020 net interest income before provision for credit losses for this segment was $277.5 million, a decrease of $88.5 million or 24%, compared with $366.0 million for the same period in 2019. Interest income earned on loans remained relatively flat; interest expense paid on deposits decreased by 36%, driven by a decline in the average cost of deposits; FTP funding charges assessed for loans decreased, reflecting a decline in the loans FTP rate, and FTP credits received for deposits also decreased, reflecting a decline in the deposits FTP rate. Combined, these factors drove a 24% decrease in segment net interest income before provision for credit losses, with the largest driver of the unfavorable result being lower FTP credits received for deposits. 

First half 2020 average loans for this segment were $11.64 billion, an increase of $1.20 billion or 11% from $10.44 billion for the same period in 2019, primarily driven by an increase in single-family residential portfolio. First half 2020 average deposits for this segment were $26.30 billion, an increase of $1.27 billion or 5% from $25.03 billion for the same period in 2019, primarily driven by increases in noninterest-bearing demand and money market deposits. 

Commercial Banking 

The Commercial Banking segment primarily generates commercial loans and deposits. Commercial loan products include commercial business loans and lines of credit, trade finance loans and letters of credit, CRE loans, construction and land lending, affordable housing loans and letters of credit, asset-based lending, and equipment financing. Commercial deposit products and other financial services include treasury management, foreign exchange services, and interest rate and commodity risk hedging. 

The Commercial Banking segment reported segment net income of $40.2 million for the second quarter of 2020, compared with $76.9 million for the same period in 2019. The decrease in segment net income of $36.7 million or 48% reflected an increase in provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in net interest income before provision for credit losses. Second quarter 2020 provision for credit losses was $96.9 million, an increase of $79.3 million or 449%, compared with $17.6 million for the same period in 2019. This increase was primarily due to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and outlook as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as due to loan risk rating downgrades. 

Second quarter 2020 net interest income before provision for credit losses for this segment was $183.8 million, an increase of $24.9 million or 16% compared with $158.9 million for the same period in 2019. Interest income earned on loans decreased by 21% , driven by a decrease in average loan yields, which more than offset the income growth driven by the average loan growth; interest expense paid on deposits decreased by 46%, driven by a decline in the average cost of deposits; FTP funding charges assessed for loans decreased, reflecting a decline in the FTP rate on loans, and FTP credits received for deposits also decreased, reflecting a decline in the FTP rate on deposits. Combined, these factors contributed to an increase of 16% in segment net interest income before provision for credit losses, which were primarily driven by lower FTP funding charges assessed for loans. 

Second quarter 2020 average loans for this segment were $25.13 billion, an increase of $2.68 billion or 12% from $22.45 billion for the same period in 2019, primarily driven by the growth in CRE and C&#38;I loan portfolios. Second quarter 2020 average deposits were $10.64 billion, an increase of $2.29 billion or 27% from $8.35 billion for the same period in 2019, primarily driven by an increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. 

The Commercial Banking segment reported segment net income of $97.3 million for the first half of 2020, compared with $139.2 million for the same period in 2019. The decrease in segment net income of $41.9 million or 30% reflected an increase in provision for credit losses, partially offset by increases in net interest income before provision for credit losses and noninterest income. First half 2020 provision for credit losses was $162.9 million, an increase of $125.7 million or 338%, compared with $37.2 million for the same period in 2019. This increase was primarily due to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and outlook as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as due to loan risk rating downgrades. 

First half 2020 net interest income before provision for credit losses for this segment was $367.3 million, an increase of $55.7 million or 18% compared with $311.6 million for the same period in 2019. Interest income earned on loans decreased by 13% , which was primarily attributable to a decrease in average loan yields, which more than offset income growth driven by average loan growth; interest expense paid on deposits decreased by 31% , driven by a decline in the average cost of deposits; FTP funding charges assessed for loans decreased, reflecting a decline in the FTP rate on loans; FTP credits received for deposits also decreased, reflecting a decline in the FTP rate on deposits. Combined, these factors drove an increase of 18% in segment net interest income before provision for credit losses, which were primarily driven by lower FTP funding charges assessed for loans. First half 2020 noninterest income was $66.3 million, an increase of $8.1 million or 14%, compared with $58.2 million for the same period in 2019. This increase was mainly attributable to an increase in the valuation of warrants received as part of lending relationships. 

First half 2020 average loans for this segment were $24.51 billion, an increase of $2.25 billion or 10% from $22.26 billion for the same period in 2019, primarily driven by the growth in CRE and C&#38;I loan portfolios. First half 2020 average deposits for this segment were $9.91 billion, an increase of $1.72 billion or 21% from $8.19 billion for the same period in 2019, primarily driven by increases in noninterest-bearing demand and time deposits. 

Other 

Centralized functions, including the corporate treasury activities of the Company and eliminations of inter-segment amounts, have been aggregated and included in the Other segment, which provides broad administrative support to the two core segments, namely the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments. 

The Other segment reported segment income before income taxes of $3.2 million and segment net income of $21.1 million for the second quarter of 2020, reflecting an income tax benefit of $17.9 million. In comparison, the Other segment reported segment income before income taxes of $5.4 million and segment net loss of $5.2 million for the second quarter of 2019, reflecting an income tax expense of $10.6 million. 

The decrease in second quarter 2020 segment income before income taxes was primarily driven by an increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by increases in net interest income before provision for credit losses and noninterest income. Noninterest expense was $42.6 million, an increase of $15.9 million or 60%, compared with $26.7 million for the same period in 2019. The increase was mainly attributable to a reduction in value for investments accounted for under the equity method and an increase in amortization expense from tax credit investments placed in service in 2020. In addition, the Company prepaid $150.0 million of repurchase agreements and incurred a debt extinguishment cost of $8.7 million during the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter 2020 net interest income before provision for credit losses was $35.1 million, an increase of $7.6 million or 28%, compared with $27.5 million for the same period in 2019. The increase mainly reflected a 6 7% decrease in interest expense paid on deposits, driven by a decline in average cost of deposits and an increase in FTP net spread. FTP net spread is the difference between the total internal FTP charges and credits and is recorded as part of net interest income in the Other segment. The favorable impact on net interest income before provision for credit losses was partially offset by a decrease in interest income on investment. Second quarter 2020 noninterest income was $10.8 million, an increase of $6.2 million or 135%, compared with $4.6 million for the same period in 2019, driven by an increase in gains on sales of municipal bonds during the second quarter of 2020. 

The Other segment reported segment income before income taxes of $13.2 million and segment net income of $55.6 million for the first half of 2020, reflecting an income tax benefit of $42.4 million. In comparison, the Other segment reported segment income before income taxes of $5.4 million and segment net income of $19.3 million for the first half of 2019, reflecting an income tax benefit of $13.9 million. 

The increase in segment income before income taxes was primarily driven by increases in net interest income before provision for credit losses and noninterest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. First half 2020 net interest income before provision for credit losses was $61.7 million, an increase of $9.5 million or 18%, compared with $52.2 million for the same period in 2019. The increase reflected a 42% decrease in interest expense paid on deposits, driven by a decline in the average cost of deposits and an increase in FTP net spread. The favorable impact on net interest income before provision for credit losses was partially offset by a decrease in interest income on investments. First half 2020 noninterest income was $16.0 million, an increase of $7.6 million or 90%, compared with $8.4 million for the same period in 2019, primarily driven by the aforementioned sales of municipal bonds during the second quarter of 2020. First half 2020 noninterest expense was $64.4 million, an increase of $9.2 million or 17%, compared with $55.2 million for the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily due to the aforementioned debt extinguishment cost of $8.7 million during the second quarter of 2020. 

The income tax expense or benefit in the Other segment consists of the remaining unallocated income tax expense or benefit after allocating income tax expense to the two core segments. Income tax expense is allocated to the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments by applying statutory income tax rates to the segment income before income taxes.

(1) Includes $1.43 billion of advances from the Federal Reserve&#8217;s PPPLF. 

As of June 30, 2020, total assets were $49.41 billion, an increase of $5.21 billion or 12% from December 31, 2019, primarily due t o loan growth and increases in cash equivalents, AFS debt securities, resale agreements and interest-bearing deposits with banks. The loan growth came from each of the Company&#8217;s major loan portfolios, with the strongest growth from C&#38;I, driven by PPP loan growth. CRE and single-family residential loans contributed to the growth as well. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by deposit growth and advances from PPPLF. 

As of June 30, 2020, total liabilities were $44.42 billion, an increase of $5.24 billion or 13% from December 31, 2019, primarily due to increases in deposits and long-term debt. The increase in deposits was largely driven by increases in noninterest-bearing demand and money market accounts, partially offset by a decrease in time deposits. Deposit growth was attributable to strong growth from consumer and small business commercial customers, as well as to PPP funds held in deposit accounts, partially offset by intentional run-off of higher-cost balances. The increase in long-term debt was primarily driven by advances from PPPLF. 

As of June 30, 2020, total stockholders&#8217; equity was $4.99 billion, a decrease of $30.4 million or 1% from December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by stock repurchase transactions, cash dividends declared on common stock and a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, partially offset by first half 2020 net income. 

Debt Securities 

The Company maintains a debt securities portfolio that consists of high quality and liquid securities with relatively short durations to minimize overall interest rate and liquidity risks. The Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities provide: 

&#8226; interest income for earnings and yield enhancement; 

&#8226; availability for funding needs arising during the normal course of business; 

&#8226; the ability to execute interest rate risk management strategies in response to changes in economic or market conditions; and 

&#8226; collateral to support pledging agreements as required and/or to enhance the Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity. 

Available-for-Sale Debt Securities 

As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities portfolio primarily consisted of mortgage-backed securities and debt securities issued by U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, collateralized loan obligations (&#8220;CLOs&#8221;), non-agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasury securities, municipal securities, and foreign bonds. Debt securities classified as AFS are carried at their fair value with the corresponding changes in fair value recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax , as a component of Stockholders&#8217; equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

The following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of AFS debt securities by major categories as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019:

(1) There were no securities of a single non-governmental agency issuer that exceeded 10% of stockholder&#8217;s equity as of both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

The fair value of AFS debt securities totaled $3.88 billion as of June 30, 2020, compared with $3.32 billion as of December 31, 2019. The $567.4 million or 17% increase was primarily attributable to the purchases of U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities, U.S. Treasury securities, and non-agency mortgage-backed securities; partially offset by the sales, repayments, calls, and maturities of U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities, U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise debt securities, foreign bonds, municipal securities and U.S Treasury securities. 

The Company&#8217;s debt securities portfolio had an effective duration of 2.6 years as of June 30, 2020 which shortened from 3.1 years as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decline in interest rates. In addition, the spread between central government-guaranteed securities and private issuers widened, as relatively higher risk premiums were paid for securities issued by private entities. As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, 94% and 97%, respectively, of the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s debt securities portfolio was rated &#8220;AA-&#8221; or &#8220;Aa3&#8221; or higher by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. Credit ratings of BBB- or higher by Standard and Poor&#8217;s (&#8220;S&#38;P&#8221;) and Fitch Ratings (&#8220;Fitch&#8221;), or Baa3 or higher by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;), are considered investment grade. 

The Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities are carried at fair value with noncredit-related unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. If a credit loss exists, the Company records impairment related to credit losses through allowance for credit losses with a corresponding Provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Pre-tax net unrealized gains on AFS debt securities were $60.9 million as of June 30, 2020, which improved from net unrealized losses of $3.4 million as of December 31, 2019. This change was primarily due to the decrease in interest rates during the period, partially offset by increased spreads. 

Gross unrealized losses on AFS debt securities totaled $29.7 million as of June 30, 2020, compared with $23.2 million as of December 31, 2019. Of the securities with gross unrealized losses, substantially all were rated investment grade as of both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, as classified based upon the lowest of the credit ratings issued by S&#38;P, Moody&#8217;s, or Fitch. The Company believes that the gross unrealized losses were due to non-credit related factors and the gross unrealized losses across all major security types were primarily attributable to widened spreads arising from the negative outlook and uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and yield curve movement. The Company believes that the credit support levels of the AFS debt securities are strong and, based on current assessments and macroeconomic forecasts, expects that full contractual cash flows will be received, even if the credit performance deteriorates from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

As of June 30, 2020, the Company had no intention to sell securities with unrealized losses and believed it is more-likely-than-not that it would not be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized costs. The Company assesses individual securities for credit losses for each reporting period. There were no credit losses recognized in earnings for the second quarter and first half of 2020, and no OTTI credit losses recognized in earnings for the same periods of 2019. For additional information of the Company&#8217;s accounting policies, valuation and composition, see Note 2 &#8212; Current Accounting Developments and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , Note 3 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Note 5 &#8212; Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The following table presents the weighted-average yields and contractual maturity distribution, excluding periodic principal payments, of the Company&#8217;s debt securities as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Actual maturities of mortgage-backed securities can differ from contractual maturities as the borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties. In addition, factors such as prepayments and interest rates may affect the yields on the carrying values of mortgage-backed securities.

Loan Portfolio 

The Company offers a broad range of financial products designed to meet the credit needs of its borrowers. The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio segments include commercial loans, which consist of C&#38;I, CRE, multifamily residential, and construction and land loans; and consumer loans, which consist of single-family residential, home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;) and other consumer loans. Total net loans, including loans held-for-sale, were $36.60 billion as of June 30, 2020, an increase of $2.18 billion or 6% from $34.42 billion as of December 31, 2019. This was primarily driven by increases of $1.27 billion or 10% in C&#38;I loans driven by PPP loan growth , $623.7 million or 6% in CRE loans and $554.9 million or 8% in single-family residential loans. The composition of the loan portfolio as of June 30, 2020 was similar to the composition as of December 31, 2019.

Actions to Support Customers during the COVID-19 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company provided assistance to customers faced with financial difficulties by offering SBA PPP loans and also provided customers with payment relief through various loan modification programs. For a summary of the loans that the Company has modified in response to COVID-19, please refer to Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Credit Risk Management in this Form 10-Q . 

In April 2020, the Company started accepting PPP applications and began to originate loans to qualified small businesses under the PPP established by the CARES Act. These loans are included in the C&#38;I portfolio, carrying an interest rate of 1%, and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. No allowance for loan losses were recorded for these loans as of June 30, 2020. The Company has funded over 7,200 PPP loans for customers with an outstanding loan balance totaling $1.75 billion as of June 30, 2020 . The majority of the Company&#8217;s PPP loans have a term of two years. The SBA pays the Company fees for processing PPP loans in the following amounts: (1) five percent for loans of not more than $350,000; (2) three percent for loans of more than $350,000 and less than $2,000,000; and (3) one percent for loans of at least $2,000,000. Loan processing fees paid to the Company by the SBA are accounted for as loan origination fees, where net deferred fees are recognized over the estimated life of the loan as a yield adjustment on the loans. Payments by borrowers on PPP loans begin ten months after the loan forgiveness covered period. Under the terms of the PPP, such loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied, in which case the SBA will make payments to the Company for the forgiven amounts. If a loan is paid off or forgiven by the SBA prior to its projected estimated life, the remaining unamortized deferred fees will be recognized as interest income in that period. The PPP was originally set to expire on June 30, 2020. On July 4, 2020, the President signed legislation extending the PPP to August 8, 2020. The Company will continue to originate loans to qualified small businesses through the latest extension date. 

Commercial 

The commercial loan portfolio comprised 75% of total loans as of both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Given the widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. and the global economy, a number of industries have been or will be adversely impacted. The Company continues to actively evaluate and monitor all industries and its entire commercial portfolio for elevated levels of credit risk. During the second quarter of 2020, we undertook a review of our loan portfolio to evaluate credit exposures for sensitivity to prospective weakening of economic conditions and reviewed certain C&#38;I and CRE loans, with a particular focus on sectors that we believe are of higher risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Commercial &#8212; Commercial and Industrial Loans. C&#38;I loans totaled $13.42 billion and $12.15 billion, which accounted for 36% and 35% of total loans held-for-investment, as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The $1.27 billion or 10% increase in C&#38;I loans was primarily due to the funding of PPP loans during the second quarter of 2020. The majority of the C&#38;I loans are variable interest rate loans. The C&#38;I loan portfolio includes loans and financing for businesses in a wide spectrum of industries, and includes asset-based lending, equipment financing and leasing, project-based finance, revolving lines of credit, SBA lending, structured finance, term loans and trade finance. The Company also had a portfolio of broadly syndicated C&#38;I loans, comprised primarily of Term B loans, which totaled $960.8 million and $894.6 million as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

The C&#38;I portfolio is well-diversified by industry. The Company monitors the concentrations within the C&#38;I loan portfolio by customer exposure and industry classification, setting diversification targets and limits for specialized underwriting portfolios. Exposures to various industries within our C&#38;I portfolio are shown in the following charts as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Given the uncertainty and rapidly evolving socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company is actively monitoring its loan portfolio, assessing the financial conditions of borrowers and guarantors, and the valuation of collateral. 

Oil &#38; gas loans comprised 10% of C&#38;I loans and 3% of total loans held-for-investment as of June 30, 2020. There were $1.27 billion in oil &#38; gas loans outstanding and $346.9 million in unfunded commitments as of June 30, 2020. Based on total commitment as of June 30, 2020, the oil &#38; gas portfolio consisted of 62% exploration &#38; production (&#8220;E&#38;P&#8221;) companies, 32% midstream and downstream companies, and 6% oilfield services and other companies. Oil &#38; gas loans comprised 11% of C&#38;I loans and 4% of total loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2019. T here were $1.33 billion in oil &#38; gas loans outstanding and $477.6 million in unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2019. Based on total commitment as of December 31, 2019, the oil &#38; gas portfolio consisted of 64% E&#38;P companies, 29% midstream and downstream companies, and 7% oilfield services and other companies. The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the high volatility and downward pressure on oil &#38; gas prices, have unfavorably impacted the credit risk of the oil &#38; gas industry sector. Accordingly, the Company increased its allowance for loan loss coverage against the oil &#38; gas portfolio to 9% as of June 30, 2020, up from 5% as of December 31, 2019. 

Commercial &#8212; Commercial Real Estate Portfolio. The total CRE loan portfolio, which consists of income-producing CRE, multifamily residential, and construction and land loans, totaled $14.50 billion and $13.76 billion, which accounted for 39% and 40% of total loans held-for-investment as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

The Company&#8217;s total CRE portfolio is broadly diversified by property type, which serves to mitigate some of the geographical concentration in California. The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s total CRE loan portfolio by property type as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019:

Approximately 90% of our total CRE loans had a loan-to-value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) ratio of 65% or lower as of June 30, 2020, compared to 85% as of December 31, 2019. The weighted-average LTV ratios of total CRE loans were 52% and 50% as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The low LTV ratio was consistent across the various CRE property types. The average loan size of total CRE loans was $2.3 million and $2.1 million as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The consistency of the Company&#8217;s low LTV underwriting standards has resulted in historically lower levels of credit losses in the income-producing CRE and multifamily residential loans.

As the majority of these loans are concentrated in the California geographic market, changes in California&#8217;s economy and real estate values could have a significant impact on the collectability of these loans and the required level of allowance for loan losses. 

Commercial &#8212; Income-Producing Commercial Real Estate Loans. The Company focuses on providing financing to experienced real estate investors and developers who have moderate levels of leverage, many of whom are long-time customers of the Bank.

20% of the income-producing CRE loans were owner occupied properties as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The remainder were non-owner-occupied properties, where 50% or more of the debt service for the loan is primarily provided by unaffiliated rental income from a third party. Interest rates on CRE loans may be fixed, variable or hybrid. The distribution of the CRE loan portfolio reflects the Company&#8217;s geographical footprint, with a primary concentration in California, which accounted for 77% and 76% of the CRE loan portfolio as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

Commercial &#8212; Multifamily Residential Loans. The multifamily residential loan portfolio is largely comprised of loans secured by residential properties with five or more units.

The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 using the prospective transition approach for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration that were previously classified as purchased credit impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) and accounted for under ASC 310-30. On January 1, 2020, the amortized cost basis of the purchased credit deteriorated (&#8220;PCD&#8221;) loans was adjusted to reflect the $1.2 million addition of allowance for loan losses. The Company did not acquire any PCD loans during the first and second quarter of 2020. For additional details regarding PCD loans, see Note 2 &#8212; Current Accounting Developments and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the carrying value of PCI loans totaled $222.9 million as of December 31, 2019. 

Loans Held-for-Sale 

As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, loans held-for-sale totaled $3.9 million and $434 thousand, respectively, and consisted of single-family residential loans. At the time of commitment to originate or purchase a loan, a loan is determined to be held-for-investment if it is the Company&#8217;s intent to hold the loan to maturity or for the &#8220;foreseeable future,&#8221; subject to periodic reviews under the Company&#8217;s evaluation processes, including liquidity and credit risk management. If the Company subsequently changes its intent to hold certain loans, those loans are transferred from held-for-investment to held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value. 

Loan Purchases, Transfers and Sales 

All loans originated by the Company are underwritten pursuant to the Company&#8217;s policies and procedures. Although the Company&#8217;s primary focus is on directly originated loans, in certain circumstances, the Company also purchases loans and participates in loans with other banks. The Company also participates out interests in commercial loans to other financial institutions and sells loans in the normal course of business. 

The following tables provide information on loan sales during the second quarter and first half of 2020 and 2019. Refer to Note 7 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information of loan purchases and transfers.

Foreign Outstandings 

The Company&#8217;s overseas offices, which include the branch in Hong Kong and the subsidiary bank in China, are subject to the general risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries, such as regulations, or economic and political uncertainties. In addition, the Company&#8217;s financial assets held in the Hong Kong branch and the subsidiary bank in China may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors. The Company&#8217;s country risk exposure is largely concentrated in China and Hong Kong. The following table presents the major financial assets held in the Company&#8217;s overseas offices as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019:

Capital 

The Company maintains a strong capital base to support its anticipated asset growth, operating needs and credit risks, and to ensure that the Company and the Bank are in compliance with all regulatory capital guidelines. The Company engages in regular capital planning processes on at least an annual basis to optimize the use of available capital and to appropriately plan for future capital needs, allocating capital to existing and future business activities. Furthermore, the Company conducts capital stress tests as part of its capital planning process. The stress tests enable the Company to assess the impact of adverse changes in the economy and interest rates on its capital base. 

In March 2020, the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of the Company&#8217;s common stock. This $500.0 million repurchase authorization is inclusive of the Company&#8217;s $100.0 million stock repurchase authorization previously outstanding. The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases, based on its assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. The Company repurchased 4,471,682 shares at a total cost of $146.0 million during the first quarter of 2020. The Company did not repurchase shares during the second quarter of 2020. The Company's total remaining available share repurchase authorization as of June 30, 2020 was $354.0 million. 

The Company&#8217;s stockholders&#8217; equity was $4.99 billion as of June 30, 2020, a $30.4 million or 1% decrease from $5.02 billion as of December 31, 2019. The decrease in the Company&#8217;s stockholders&#8217; equity was primarily due to share repurchase activity of $146.0 million during the first quarter of 2020; a decrease in opening retained earnings of $98.0 million as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, and cash dividends declared of $79.9 million during the first half of 2020, partially offset by first half of 2020 net income of $244.2 million. For other factors that contributed to the changes in stockholders&#8217; equity, refer to Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders&#8217; Equit y in this Form 10-Q. 

Book value was $35.25 per common share as of June 30, 2020, compared with $34.46 per common share as of December 31, 2019. The Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.275 for both first and second quarter of 2020, and $0.23 and $0.275 per common share for the first and second quarter of 2019, respectively. In July 2020, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors declared third quarter 2020 cash dividends of $0.275 per common share. The dividend is payable on August 17, 2020 to stockholders of record as of August 4, 2020. 

Deposits and Other Sources of Funds 

Deposits are the Company&#8217;s primary source of funding, the cost of which has a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s net interest income and net interest margin. Additional funding is provided by short and long-term borrowings, and long-term debt. See Item 2 &#8212; MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity Risk Management in this Form 10-Q for a discussion of the Company&#8217;s liquidity management.

Deposits 

The Company offers a wide variety of deposit products to both consumer and commercial customers. The Company&#8217;s deposit strategy is to grow and retain relationship-based deposits, which provides a stable and low-cost source of funding and liquidity to the Company. 

Total deposits were $40.67 billion as of June 30, 2020, an increase of $3.35 billion or 9% from $37.32 billion as of December 31, 2019. This growth was primarily due to a $2.86 billion or 26% increase in noninterest-bearing demand and a $1.29 billion or 15% increase in money market, partially offset by a $951.8 million or 9% decrease in time deposits. The increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits was attributable to strong growth from consumer and small business commercial demand accounts, as well as PPP funds held in deposit accounts. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits comprised 34% and 30% of total deposits as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Additional information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest income and a comparison of average deposit balances and rates are provided in Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Results of Operations &#8212; Net Interest Income in this Form 10-Q. 

Other Sources of Funding 

Short-term borrowings were comprised of FRB discount window borrowing and short-term borrowings entered into by the Company&#8217;s subsidiary, East West Bank (China) Limited. The Company had $252.9 million of short-term borrowings outstanding as of June 30, 2020, compared with $28.7 million as of December 31, 2019. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company borrowed $200.0 million from the FRB discount window with a term of 90 days at a rate of 0.25%. Short-term borrowings entered by East West Bank (China) Limited was $52.9 million and $28.7 million as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of June 30, 2020, short-term borrowings entered by East West Bank (China) Limited had fixed interest rates ranging from 3.68% to 3.73%, and will mature between the third quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. 

FHLB advances were $656.8 million as of June 30, 2020, a decrease of $89.2 million or 12% from $745.9 million as of December 31, 2019. As of June 30, 2020, FHLB advances had fixed and floating interest rates ranging from zero to 2.34% with remaining maturities between 0.3 years and 2.4 years. 

Gross repurchase agreements totaled $300.0 million and $450.0 million as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the extinguishment of $150.0 million in the second quarter of 2020. Resale and repurchase agreements are reported net, pursuant to ASC 210-20-45-11, Balance Sheet Offsetting: Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements . As of June 30, 2020, the Company did not have gross resale agreements that were eligible for netting pursuant to ASC 210-20-45-11. In comparison, net repurchase agreements totaled $200.0 million as of December 31, 2019, after netting $250.0 million of gross repurchase agreements against gross resale agreements. As of June 30, 2020, gross repurchase agreements had interest rates ranging from 2.55% to 3.26%, original terms between 4.0 years and 8.5 years and remaining maturities between 3.1 years and 3.2 years. 

Repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded as liabilities based on the values at which the securities are sold. As of June 30, 2020, the collateral for the repurchase agreements was comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities. To ensure the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, the Company monitors the fair value of collateral pledged relative to the principal amounts borrowed under repurchase agreements. The Company manages liquidity risks related to the repurchase agreements by sourcing funds from a diverse group of counterparties and entering into repurchase agreements with longer durations, when appropriate. For additional details, see Note 4 &#8212; Securities Purchased under Resale Agreements and Sold under Repurchase Agreements to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The Company uses long-term debt to provide funding to acquire interest-earning assets, as well as to enhance liquidity and regulatory capital. Long-term debt totaled $1.58 billion and $147.1 million as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Long-term debt is comprised of PPPLF and junior subordinated debt. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company participated in the PPPLF and added $1.43 billion to long-term debt funding at a rate of 0.35%. Junior subordinated debt qualifies as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. The junior subordinated debt was issued in connection with the Company&#8217;s various pooled trust preferred securities offerings and includes the value of the common stock issued by six wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company in conjunction with these offerings. The junior subordinated debt had a weighted-average interest rate of 2.67% and 4.21% for the first half of 2020 and 2019, respectively, with remaining maturities ranging between 15.2 years and 17.2 years as of June 30, 2020. 

Regulatory Capital and Ratios 

The federal banking agencies have risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that is commensurate with the degree of risk associated with a banking organization&#8217;s operations. See Item 1. Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Capital Requirements of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K for additional details. 

The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. The Company has elected the phase-in option provided by regulatory guidance, which delays the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for two years and phases the impact over three years beginning in 2022. In April 2020, in recognition of CARES Act requirements, and to facilitate the use of the PPPLF, the U.S banking agencies issued an interim final rule that banking organizations may exclude from leverage and risk-based capital requirements any eligible assets sold or pledged to the Federal Reserve on a non-recourse basis as part of these programs. The interim final rule states that PPP covered loans originated by a banking organization under PPP will be risk-weighted at zero percent for regulatory capital purposes. As a result, the June 30, 2020 capital ratios exclude the impact of the increased allowance for loan losses and risk weighted PPP loans at zero percent. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 under the Basel III Capital Rules, and those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well-capitalized classification purposes:

(2) As of January 1, 2019, the 2.5% capital conservation buffer above the minimum capital ratios was required in order to avoid limitations on distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. 

The Company is committed to maintaining strong capital levels to assure the Company&#8217;s investors, customers and regulators that the Company and the Bank are financially sound. As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, both the Company and the Bank continued to exceed all &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; capital requirements and the fully phased-in required minimum capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules. Total risk-weighted assets were $36.20 billion as of June 30, 2020, an increase of $1.06 billion or 3% from $35.14 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in the risk-weighted assets was primarily due to loan growth. 

Other Matters 

LIBOR Transition 

On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Given LIBOR&#8217;s extensive use across financial markets, the transition away from LIBOR presents various risks and challenges to financial markets and institutions, including to the Company. The Company&#8217;s commercial and consumer businesses issue, trade, and hold various products that are currently indexed to LIBOR. A portion of the Company&#8217;s loans, derivatives, debt securities, resale agreements, FHLB advances, as well as junior subordinated debt and repurchase agreements are indexed to LIBOR and mature after 2021. The volume of the Company&#8217;s products that are indexed to LIBOR is significant, and if not sufficiently planned for, the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in financial, operational, legal, reputational or compliance risks. 

The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (&#8220;ARRC&#8221;) has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. In 2019, the ARRC released recommended fallback contract language for new issuances of LIBOR indexed bilateral business loans, syndicated loans, floating-rate notes, securitizations and residential adjustable rate mortgages. During 2020, the ARRC has continued to provide guidance on fallback language, SOFR adoption and spread adjustment methodology. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. is in the process of developing detailed guidance on fallback contract language and amendments to the 2006 International Swaps and Derivatives Association Definitions and related protocols. 

The Company has been closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 and any potential delay in the cessation of LIBOR. Although the Financial Conduct Authority continues to assess the evolving impact of COVID-19 on firms&#8217; LIBOR transition efforts, the target LIBOR cessation date currently remains unchanged. 

Due to the uncertainty surrounding the future of LIBOR, the transition is anticipated to span several reporting periods through the end of 2021. Certain actions already taken by the Company related to the transition of LIBOR include (1) establishing a cross-functional team to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the transition of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, (2) completing an inventory of LIBOR indexed products, (3) implementing more robust fallback contract language for new loans, which identifies LIBOR cessation trigger events, provides for an alternative index and permits an adjustment to the margin as applicable, and (4) creating an entity-wide transition project plan, to ensure an effective transition away from LIBOR. The Company continues to monitor this activity and evaluate the related risks. The Company&#8217;s cross-functional team also manages communication of the Company&#8217;s transition plans with both internal and external stakeholders and ensures that the Company appropriately updates its business processes, analytical tools, information systems and contract language to minimize disruption during and after the LIBOR transition. For additional information related to the potential impact surrounding the transition from LIBOR on the Company&#8217;s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the course of the Company&#8217;s business, the Company may enter into or be a party to transactions that are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are considered to be off-balance sheet arrangements. Off-balance sheet arrangements are any contractual arrangements to which a nonconsolidated entity is a party and under which the Company has: (1) any obligation under a guarantee contract; (2) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets; (3) any obligation under certain derivative instruments; or (4) any obligation under a material variable interest held by the Company in a nonconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the Company. 

Commitments to Extend Credit 

As a financial service provider, the Company routinely enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, commercial letters of credit for foreign and domestic trade, standby letters of credit (&#8220;SBLCs&#8221;) and financial guarantees to meet the financing needs of our customers. Many of these commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. The credit policies used in underwriting loans to customers are also used to extend these commitments. Under some of these contractual agreements, the Company may also have liabilities contingent upon the occurrence of certain events. The Company&#8217;s liquidity sources have been, and are expected to be, sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its lending activities. Information about the Company&#8217;s loan commitments, commercial letters of credit and SBLCs is provided in Note 10 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Guarantees 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into various guarantee agreements in which the Company sells or securitizes loans with recourse. Under these guarantee arrangements, the Company is contingently obligated to repurchase the recourse component of the loans when the loans default. Additional information regarding guarantees is provided in Note 10 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

A discussion of significant contractual arrangements under which the Company may be held contingently liable is included in Note 10 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. In addition, the Company has commitments and obligations under post-retirement benefit plans as described in Note 17 &#8212; Employee Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K, and has contractual obligations for future payments on debts, borrowings and lease obligations as detailed in Item 7.

Risk Management 

Overview 

In the course of conducting its businesses, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent to the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to the Company&#8217;s businesses. The Company operates under a Board-approved enterprise risk management (&#8220;ERM&#8221;) framework, which outlines its company-wide approach to risk management and oversight and describes the structures and practices employed to manage the current and emerging risks inherent to the Company. The Company&#8217;s ERM program incorporates risk management throughout the organization in identifying, managing, monitoring, and reporting risks. It identifies the Company&#8217;s major risk categories as capital risk, strategic risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, operational risk, reputational risk, and legal and compliance risk. 

The Board of Directors monitors the ERM program to ensure independent review and oversight of the Company&#8217;s risk appetite and control environment. The Risk Oversight Committee provides focused oversight of the Company&#8217;s identified enterprise risk categories on behalf of the full Board of Directors. Under the direction of the Risk Oversight Committee, management committees apply targeted strategies to reduce the risks to which the Company&#8217;s operations are exposed. 

The Company&#8217;s ERM program is executed along the three lines of defense model, which provides for a consistent and standardized risk management control environment across the enterprise. The first line of defense is comprised of production, operational, and support units. The second line of defense is comprised of various risk management and control functions charged with monitoring and managing specific major risk categories and/or risk subcategories. The third line of defense is comprised of the Internal Audit function and Independent Asset Review. Internal Audit provides assurance and evaluates the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes as established by the Company. Internal Audit has organizational independence and objectivity, reporting directly to the Board&#8217;s Audit Committee. Further discussion and analyses of each major risk area are included in the following sub-sections of Risk Management. 

Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk is the risk that a borrower or counterparty will fail to perform according to terms and conditions of a loan or investment and expose the Company to loss. Credit risk exists with many of our assets and exposures such as loans and certain derivatives. The majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities. 

The Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility of identifying enterprise risk categories including credit risk. The Risk Oversight Committee monitors management&#8217;s assessment of asset quality and credit risk trends, credit quality administration and underwriting standards, portfolio credit risk management and processes to enable management to control credit risk including diversification and liquidity. At the management level, the Credit Risk Management Committee has primary oversight responsibility for credit risk. The Senior Credit Supervision function manages credit policy and provides the resources to manage the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all exposure is risk rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy. The Senior Credit Supervision function reports on the overall credit risk portfolio to senior management and the Risk Oversight Committee. The Independent Asset Review function supports a strong credit risk management culture by providing independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, reporting directly to the Board&#8217;s Risk Oversight Committee. A key focus of our credit risk management is adherence to a well-controlled underwriting process. 

The company assesses overall credit quality performance of our held-for-investment portfolio through an integrate analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: Nonperforming Assets, TDRs and Allowance for Credit Losses. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans, other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;), and other nonperforming assets. OREO and other nonperforming assets are repossessed assets and properties acquired through foreclosure, or through full or partial satisfaction of loans held-for-investment. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due or when the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain regardless of the length of past due status. Collectability is generally assessed based on economic and business conditions, the borrower&#8217;s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, if any. For additional details regarding the Company&#8217;s nonaccrual loan policy, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Loans Held-for-Investment to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K. 

The following table presents information regarding nonperforming assets as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019:

Period-over-period changes to nonaccrual loans represent loans that are placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with the Company&#8217;s accounting policy, offset by reductions for loan repayments and for loans that are paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or no longer classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and improvement in the borrowers&#8217; financial condition. Nonaccrual loans were $178.8 million as of June 30, 2020, an increase of $58.6 million or 49% from $120.2 million as of December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily driven by the oil &#38; gas C&#38;I and CRE loans that became nonaccrual in the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by payoffs and charge-offs of C&#38;I loans. Credit risk related to the C&#38;I nonaccrual loans were partially mitigated by the collaterals in place. Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of loans held-for-investment were 0.48% and 0.35% as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. C&#38;I nonaccrual loans were 47% and 62% of total nonaccrual loans as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of June 30, 2020, $58.7 million, or 33%, of the $178.8 million nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent. In comparison, $35.6 million or 30%, of the $120.2 million nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent as of December 31, 2019. 

OREO increased by $19.4 million from $125 thousand as of December 31, 2019 to $19.5 million as of June 30, 2020 due to the Company taking possession of a retail CRE property located in Southern California in the first quarter of 2020.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

TDRs are loans for which contractual terms have been modified by the Company for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, and for which a concession to the borrower was granted that the Company would not otherwise consider. Our loan modifications are handled on a case-by-case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet the borrower&#8217;s financial needs. The Company has implemented various consumer and commercial loan modification programs to provide its borrowers relief from the economic impacts of COVID-19 that were not accounted for as TDRs. Existing TDRs that were subsequently modified in response to COVID-19 continue to be classified as TDRs. As of June 30, 2020, there were 14 TDRs totaling $29.3 million were provided subsequent modifications related to COVID-19. 

The following table presents the performing and nonperforming TDRs by portfolio segments as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019:

Performing TDRs were $82.8 million as of June 30, 2020, an increase of $4.9 million or 6% from $77.9 million as of December 31, 2019. This increase primarily reflected $26.7 million in newly designated C&#38;I TDR loans, partially offset by paydowns and payoffs of existing C&#38;I TDR loans. Nonperforming TDRs were $23.7 million as of June 30, 2020, a decrease of $30.8 million or 57% from $54.6 million as of December 31, 2019. This decrease primarily reflected $37.1 million in payoffs and paydowns of C&#38;I loans, $11.1 million in the transfer of nonperforming CRE loans to OREO, partially offset by $17.2 million new designation of C&#38;I non-performing TDR loans. The allowance for loan losses for TDRs was $1.6 million and $400 thousand as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. See Note 7 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Loan Modifications Due to COVID-19 

As of June 30, 2020, the Company provided $2.82 billion in COVID-19 related loan modifications that were not considered TDRs to consumer and commercial customers. The aging of loan modifications related to COVID-19 are frozen at the time of the modification. Interest income continues to be recognized over the contractual life of the loan. For more information related to the Company&#8217;s accounting policy on loan modifications related to COVID-19, see Note 2 &#8212; Current Accounting Developments and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q . 

Loan Modifications under Section 4013 CARES Act &#8212; The CARES Act includes a provision that permits a financial institution to elect to temporarily suspend TDR accounting under ASC Subtopic 310-40 in certain circumstances (&#8220;Section 4013 CARES Act&#8221;). To be eligible under section 4013, a loan modification must be (1) related to COVID-19; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of (a) 60 days after the date of termination of the federal National Emergency or (b) December 31, 2020. The Company provided relief programs under Section 4013 CARES Act to 2,890 loans totaling $2.68 billion, none of which were on nonaccrual status as of June 30, 2020. The majority of Section 4013 loan modification programs offered by our Company were comprised of payment deferrals. As of June 30, 2020, 288 commercial loans totaling $1.46 billion, comprising 55% of outstanding loan balances under the Section 4013 payment deferral program were primarily on a three-month payment deferral program, comprising of either principal payment deferrals or a combination of principal and interest payment deferrals. The deferred payments for commercial loans are either repaid at contractual maturity or over the remaining contractual term of the loan. As of June 30, 2020, 2,590 consumer loans totaling $ 1.17 billion, comprising 44% of the outstanding loan balances under the payment deferral program, were primarily comprised of single-family residential loans with payment deferrals ranging between two to six months. The deferred payments for consumer loans are either repaid at contractual maturity, or repaid over six or 12 months. Section 4013 forbearance programs consisted of interest rate reductions and/or concessions. As of June 30, 2020, there were three CRE loans totaling $30.6 million under the Section 4013 forbearance programs. 

Loan Modifications under Interagency Statement &#8212; In response to the loan modification provisions under the CARES Act, the federal banking regulators issued a revised interagency statement on April 7, 2020 that, in consultation with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;), confirmed that for loans not subject to section 4013, short-term modifications (i.e. six months or less) made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief are not TDRs under ASC Subtopic 310-40. As of June 30, 2020, there were 293 loans totaling $143.0 million under the payment deferral program, comprising primarily of single-family residential loans, of which 90 single-family residential loans totaling $15.1 million were under the Federal Housing Finance Agency payment deferral program. The remaining $127.9 million loans primarily had a three-month payment deferral to be repaid either over six or 12 months. The majority of these loans were performing loans. 

The following table presents loan modifications in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, by modification types, portfolio segments, and accommodation categories as of June 30, 2020, none of which were classified as TDRs:

Allowance for Credit Losses 

Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments &#8212; Credit Losses that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company&#8217;s relevant financial assets. The allowance for credit losses estimate uses various models and estimation techniques based on our historical loss experience, current borrower characteristics, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts and other relevant factors. The adoption of the new accounting standard increased the allowance for loan losses by $125.2 million, and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments by $10.5 million, partially offset by an after-tax decrease to opening retained earnings of $98.0 million on January 1, 2020. 

The Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups loans with similar risk characteristics and specific allowance for loans which are individually evaluated. For collectively evaluated loans, the Company uses quantitative models to forecast expected credit losses and these models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. The Company also considers qualitative factors in determining the allowance for loan losses. Qualitative adjustments are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses which are not fully captured within the Company&#8217;s expected credit loss models. 

In addition to the allowance for loan losses, the Company maintains an allowance for unfunded credit commitments. The Company has three general areas where it provides the allowance for unfunded credit commitments: recourse obligations for loans sold, letters of credit and unfunded lending commitments. The Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the allowance for unfunded lending commitments calculation uses the lifetime loss rates of the on-balance sheet commitment. Recourse obligations for loans sold and letters of credit use the weighted loss rates for the segment of individual credit. 

The Company employs a disciplined process and methodology to establish its allowance for loan losses each quarter. The process for estimating the allowance for loan losses takes into consideration many factors, including historical and forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and loan-specific risk characteristics. In addition to regular quarterly reviews of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, the Company performs ongoing assessments of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is complex and requires judgement by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 

The Company is committed to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level that is commensurate with the estimated inherent losses in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit facilities. While the Company believes that the allowance for loan losses was appropriate as of June 30, 2020, future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, accounting standard and regulatory changes, loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions. See Note 2 &#8212; &#160; Current Accounting Developments and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; &#160; New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted , Note 7 &#8212; Loans Receivables and Allowance for Loan Losses &#8212; Allowance for Loan Losses and Item 2.

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s credit quality ratios for the second quarters and the first half of 2020 and 2019: 

($ in thousands) Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Average loans held-for-investment $ 37,139,949 &#160; $ 32,981,161 &#160; $ 36,146,736 &#160; $ 32,699,380 &#160; Loans held-for-investment 37,229,412 &#160; $ 33,730,377 &#160; $ 37,229,412 &#160; $ 33,730,377 &#160; Allowance for loan losses to loans held-for-investment

0.21 % 0.09 % 0.11 % 0.14 % 

As of June 30, 2020, the allowance for loan losses amounted to $632.1 million or 1.70% of loans held-for-investment, compared with $358.3 million or 1.03% and $330.6 million or 0.98% of loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in allowance for loan losses were largely due to a combination of factors: deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and outlook as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a provision for credit losses of $102.4 million and $176.3 million for the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, and the adoption of ASU 2016-13, which increased the allowance for loan losses by $125.2 million on January 1, 2020. Second quarter 2020 gross charge-offs were $20.9 million and were primarily from C&#38;I loans, partially offset by gross recoveries of $1.7 million, resulting in net charge-offs of $19.2 million or annualized 0.21% of average loans held-for-investment. First half 2020 gross charge-offs were $33.9 million and were primarily from C&#38;I loans, partially offset by recoveries of $13.8 million, primarily from CRE loans, resulting in net charge-offs of $20.1 million or annualized 0.11% of average loans held-for-investment. Charge-offs in C&#38;I portfolio totaled $20.4 million and $32.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. These primarily comprised of oil &#38; gas loan charge-offs of $13.8 million and $25.7 million in these respective periods. 

As previously discussed, the Company has implemented various consumer and commercial loan modification programs to provide its borrowers relief from the economic impacts of COVID-19. As of June 30, 2020, the Bank funded PPP loans for over 7,200 customers, with an outstanding loan balance totaling $1.75 billion. As these loans are 100% guaranteed by SBA, the Company expects that these loans will have zero expected loss. As a result, as of June 30, 2020, these loans had no related allowance for loan losses. Additionally, in consideration of the economic disruption caused by COVID-19, the Company offered temporary loan accommodations. In calculating the allowance, these loans were included in the general reserve in their corresponding loan categories. The Company further evaluated these loans and noted that no additional qualitative allowance was needed for the impact of the pandemic because the effects were captured through the forecast used by the models. 

The allowance for unfunded credit commitments was $29.0 million as of June 30, 2020, compared with $11.2 million and $13.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. The Company believes that the allowance for loan losses as of June 30, 2020, December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 was adequate. 

The following table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13):

The allowance for loan losses increased $273.8 million or 76% from December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13 of $74.2 million in C&#38;I and $72.2 million in CRE loans, as well as first half 2020 provision for C&#38;I and CRE credit losses of $98.5 million and $54.8 million, respectively, mainly due to the significant deterioration in the economic outlook from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by first half 2020 C&#38;I gross charge-offs of $32.4 million, primarily from our oil &#38; gas loan portfolio. 

Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, allowance for loan losses for PCD loans is determined using the same methodology as other loans held-for-investment. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had no allowance for loan losses against $222.9 million of PCI loans. 

Liquidity Risk Management 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is a financial institution&#8217;s capacity to meet its deposit and other counterparties&#8217; obligations as they come due, or to obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost to meet those obligations. The objective of liquidity management is to manage the potential mismatch of asset and liability cash flows. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institution&#8217;s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flows, and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily operations or the financial condition of the institution. To achieve this objective, the Company analyzes its liquidity risk, maintains readily available liquid assets and utilizes diverse funding sources including its stable core deposit base. 

The Board of Directors&#8217; Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility. At the management level, the Company&#8217;s Asset/Liability Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) sets the liquidity guidelines that govern the day-to-day active management of the Company&#8217;s liquidity position. The ALCO regularly monitors the Company&#8217;s liquidity status and related management processes, and provides regular reports to the Board of Directors. These liquidity management practices have allowed the Company to effectively manage the market stress that began in the first quarter of 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Sources. The Company&#8217;s primary source of funding is from deposits generated by its banking business, which is relatively stable and low-cost. Total deposits amounted to $40.67 billion as of June 30, 2020, compared with $37.32 billion as of December 31, 2019. The Company&#8217;s loan-to-deposit ratio was 92% and 93% as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. In addition, the Company has access to various sources of wholesale funding, as well as borrowing capacity at the FHLB and FRB of San Francisco to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute its business strategy. Economic conditions and the stability of capital markets impact the Company&#8217;s access to and the cost of wholesale financing. The Company&#8217;s access to capital markets is also affected by the ratings received from various credit rating agencies. See Item 2 &#8212; MD&#38;A &#8212; Balance Sheet Analysis &#8212; Deposits and Other Sources of Funds in this Form 10-Q for further detail related to the Company&#8217;s funding sources. 

The Company&#8217;s liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits with banks, short-term resale agreements and AFS debt securities. The following table presents the Company&#8217;s liquid assets as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019:

Unencumbered liquid assets totaled $8.90 billion and $6.70 billion as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. AFS debt securities included as part of liquidity sources are primarily comprised of mortgage-backed securities and debt securities issued by U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, U.S. Treasury securities, municipal securities and foreign bonds. The Company believes these AFS debt securities provide quick sources of liquidity to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions, through sale or pledging. 

As a means of augmenting the Company&#8217;s liquidity, the Company maintains available borrowing capacity under secured borrowing lines with the FHLB and FRB, unsecured federal funds lines of credit with various correspondent banks, and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies. The Company&#8217;s available borrowing capacity with the FHLB and FRB as of June 30, 2020, was $7.19 billion and $4.35 billion, respectively. Unencumbered loans and/or securities were pledged to the FHLB and FRB discount window as collateral. Eligibility of collateral is defined in guidelines from the FHLB and FRB and is subject to change at their discretion. The Bank&#8217;s unsecured federal funds lines of credit, subject to availability, totaled $1.00 billion with correspondent banks as of June 30, 2020. Estimated borrowing capacity from unpledged AFS debt securities totaled $2.78 billion as of June 30, 2020. In connection with the Company&#8217;s participation in the PPP under the CARES Act, the Company has the ability to pledge loans it has made under the SBA&#8217;s PPP program to the PPPLF and receive term funding matching the term of the pledged loans for the full balance of PPP loans held by the Company. As of June 30, 2020, the Company had drawn down $1.43 billion from the Federal Reserve PPPLF and had $343.6 million PPP loans available to be pledged as collateral to secure additional funding. In sum, the Company had available borrowing capacity of $15.66 billion as of June 30, 2020, and the Company believes that its liquidity sources are sufficient to meet all reasonably foreseeable short-term needs over the next 12 months. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity for East West. East West&#8217;s primary source of liquidity is from cash dividends distributed by its subsidiary, East West Bank. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends as discussed in Item 1 . Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K. During the first half of 2020 and 2019, the Bank paid total dividends of $511.0 million and $90.0 million to East West, respectively. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Stress Testing. Liquidity stress testing is performed at the Company level, as well as at the foreign subsidiary and foreign branch levels. Stress testing and scenario analysis are intended to quantify the potential impact of a liquidity event on the financial and liquidity position of the entity. These scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, market triggers and potential uses of funding and economic conditions in certain countries. In addition, Company specific events are incorporated into the stress testing. Liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons, both immediate and longer term, and over a variety of stressed conditions. Given the range of potential stresses, the Company maintains a series of contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities. 

In response to recent developments relating to COVID-19, the Company is continuing to closely monitor the impact of the pandemic on its business. The uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and in the financial service industry in general could potentially impact the liquidity of the Company. The prolonged strained economic, capital, credit and/or financial market conditions may expose the Company to liquidity risk. Nevertheless, the Company believes that the market conditions have shown signs of improvement after the Federal Reserve stepped in with a broad array of actions to stabilize financial markets and lower borrowing costs. As of June 30, 2020, the Company was not aware of any material commitments for capital expenditures in the foreseeable future and believes it has adequate liquidity resources to conduct operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of business. Given the uncertainty and the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company will continue to actively evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business and financial position.

Operating Activities &#8212; Net cash provided by operating activities was $270.9 million and $290.0 million for the first half of 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the first half of 2020 and 2019, net cash provided by operating activities mainly reflected inflows of $244.2 million and $314.4 million from net income, respectively. During the first half of 2020, net operating cash inflows also benefited from $228.3 million of noncash adjustments to reconcile net income to net operating cash, as well as $257.4 million of net changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by $456.4 million of net changes in accrued interest receivable and other assets. The $456.4 million of net changes in accrued interest receivable and other assets between June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was primarily due to changes in derivative asset fair values. In comparison, during the same period in 2019, net operating cash inflows benefited from $113.6 million of noncash adjustments to reconcile net income to net operating cash, which was offset by $150.2 million of net changes in accrued interest receivable and other assets. 

Investing Activities &#8212; Net cash used in investing activities was $3.51 billion and $997.2 million for the first half of 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the first half of 2020, net cash used in investing activities primarily reflected cash outflows of $2.48 billion from loans held-for-investment, $501.1 million from AFS debt securities, $315.5 million from interest-bearing deposits with banks and $150.0 million from resale agreements. The cash outflows from loans held-for-investment were primarily due to C&#38;I, CRE and single-family residential loan growth during the first half of 2020. During the same period in 2019, net cash used in investing activities primarily reflected cash outflows of $1.35 billion from loans held-for-investment, partially offset by $222.4 million increase in interest-bearing deposits with banks and $175.7 million net decrease in AFS debt securities. 

Financing Activities &#8212; Net cash provided by financing activities was $4.53 billion and $1.33 billion for the first half of 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the first half of 2020, net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected net increases of $3.36 billion in deposits, $1.43 billion in PPPLF advances and $225.8 million in short-term borrowings, partially offset by $158.7 million in repayment of repurchase agreements and its extinguishment cost, $146.0 million in shares repurchased, $90.0 million net repayment of FHLB advances, and $80.3 million in cash dividends. During the same period in 2019, net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected a $1.04 billion net increase in deposits and a $418.0 million net increase in FHLB advances, partially offset by cash dividends of $74.9 million and a $38.1 million decrease in short-term borrowings. 

Market Risk Management 

Market risk is the risk that the Company&#8217;s financial condition may change resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, interest rate contracts, investment securities prices, credit spreads, and related risk resulting from mismatches in rate sensitive assets and liabilities. In the event of market stress, the risk could have a material impact on our results of financial condition. 

The Board&#8217;s Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility. At the management level, the ALCO establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market risk management activities. Corporate Treasury supports the ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks. 

Interest Rate Risk Management 

Interest rate risk results primarily from the Company&#8217;s traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans, and is the primary market risk for the Company. Economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates, and consumer preferences impact the level of noninterest-bearing funding sources at the Company, and affect the difference between the interest the Company earns on interest-earning assets and pays on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, changes in interest rates can influence the rate of principal prepayments on loans and the speed of deposit withdrawals. Due to the pricing term mismatches and the embedded options inherent in certain products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic value of these interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Other market risks include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk. These risks are not considered significant to the Company and no separate quantitative information concerning these risks is presented herein. 

With oversight by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, the ALCO coordinates the overall management of the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk. The ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing the Company&#8217;s open market positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. Management of interest rate risk is carried out primarily through strategies involving the Company&#8217;s investment securities portfolio, loan portfolio, available funding channels and capital market activities. In addition, the Company&#8217;s policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk. 

The interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools, which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under multiple interest rate scenarios. The model incorporates the Company&#8217;s cash instruments, loans, debt securities, resale agreements, deposits, borrowings and repurchase agreements, as well as financial instruments from the Company&#8217;s foreign operations. The Company incorporates both a static balance sheet and a forward growth balance sheet in order to perform these analyses. The simulated interest rate scenarios include a non-parallel shift in the yield curve (&#8220;rate shock&#8221;) and a gradual non-parallel shift in the yield curve (&#8220;rate ramp&#8221;). In addition, the Company also performs simulations using alternative interest rate scenarios, including various permutations of the yield curve flattening, steepening or inverting. Results of these various simulations are used to formulate and gauge strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the Company&#8217;s capital and liquidity guidelines. 

The net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and re-pricing characteristics of the Company&#8217;s interest-rate sensitive assets, liabilities and related derivative contracts. It also incorporates various assumptions, which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on results. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates, the yield curve evolution and shape, the correlation between various interest rate indices, financial instrument future repricing characteristics and spread relative to benchmark rates, and the effect of interest rate floors and caps. The modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit decay and deposit beta assumptions, derived from a regression analysis of the Company&#8217;s historical deposit data. Deposit beta commonly refers to the correlation of the change in interest rates paid on deposits to changes in benchmark market interest rates. The model is also sensitive to the loan and investment prepayment assumptions, based on an independent model and the Company&#8217;s historical prepayment data, which consider anticipated prepayments under different interest rate environments. 

Simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions. To the extent actual behavior is different from the assumptions in the models, there could be a material change in interest rate sensitivity. The assumptions applied in the model are documented and supported for reasonableness, and periodically back-tested to assess their effectiveness. The Company makes appropriate calibrations to the model as needed, continually refining the model, methodology and results. Changes to key model assumptions are reviewed by the ALCO. Scenario results do not reflect strategies that management could employ to limit the impact of changing interest rate expectations. 

As the federal funds target rate range has been lowered to near zero to between 0.00% and 0.25% in March 2020 and the Federal Reserve has committed its resources to support the financial markets, business, and state and local governments, it is not expected that rates can decline further, or into the negative territory. Consequently, the simulation results for the downward interest rate scenarios as of June 30, 2020 are not provided. 

Twelve-Month Net Interest Income Simulation 

Net Interest Income simulation modeling looks at interest rate risk through earnings. It projects the changes in interest rate sensitive asset and liability cash flows, expressed in terms of net interest income, over a specified time horizon for defined interest rates scenarios. Net interest income simulations generate insight into the impact of market rates changes on earnings and guide risk management decisions. The Company assesses interest rate risk by comparing net interest income using different interest rate scenarios. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s net interest income sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points in upward direction as of June 30, 2020 and in both directions as of December 31, 2019. 

Change in Interest Rates (Basis Points) Net Interest Income Volatility (1)(2) 

June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 +200 14.6 % 13.2 % +100 6.7 % 6.7 % -100 NM (5.5) % -200 NM (8.7) % 

(1) The percentage change represents net interest income over 12 months in a stable interest rate environment versus net interest income in the various rate scenarios. 

(2) NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

The Company&#8217;s estimated twelve-month net interest income sensitivity as of June 30, 2020 was higher when compared with the sensitivity as of December 31, 2019, for the upward 200 basis point rate scenario, while the sensitivity remained unchanged for the upward 100 basis point rate scenario. This reflects a greater rate of upward repricing in the Company&#8217;s rate sensitive assets, which offsets simulated increases in interest expense from higher rates on deposits. While there has been an increase in the population of floating rate loans that are currently at their floors under the current low interest rate environment, an increase in the cash and cash equivalents along with an increase in non-interest bearing deposits and the reduction in the base case twelve-month net interest income were the primary drivers for the increased the interest rate sensitivity under the upward interest rate scenarios. 

The Company&#8217;s net interest income profile as of June 30, 2020 reflects an asset sensitive position. Net interest income would be expected to increase if interest rates rise and to decrease if interest rates decline, albeit the federal funds rate is floored at the target range between 0.00% and 0.25%. The Company is naturally asset sensitive due to the large share of variable rate loans in its loan portfolio, which are primarily linked to Prime and LIBOR indices. The Company&#8217;s interest income is vulnerable to changes in short-term interest rates. The Company&#8217;s deposit portfolio is primarily comprised of non-maturity deposits, which are not directly tied to short-term interest rate indices, but are, nevertheless, sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. 

The federal funds target rate was between 0.00% and 0.25% as of June 30, 2020 and between 1.50% and 1.75% as of December 31, 2019. After cutting the rate to a range of between 0.00% and 0.25% in March 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee pledged to maintain monetary support and planned to leave interest rates unchanged through 2022 in order to support the markets, which continued to be strained from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

While an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates was used in the simulation model described in the preceding paragraphs, the Company believes that any shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact. The rate ramp table below shows the net income volatility under a gradual non-parallel shift upward and downward of the yield curve in even quarterly increments over the first twelve months, followed by rates held constant thereafter: 

Change in Interest Rates (Basis Points) Net Interest Income Volatility (1)(2) 

June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 +200 Rate Ramp 5.7 % 6.0 % +100 Rate Ramp 2.7 % 3.0 % -100 Rate Ramp NM (2.6) % -200 Rate Ramp NM (5.1) % 

(1) The percentage change represents net interest income under a gradual non-parallel shift in even quarterly increments over 12 months. 

(2) NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

The Company believes that the rate ramp table, shown above, when evaluated together with the results of the rate shock simulation, presents a better indication of the potential impact to the Company&#8217;s twelve-month net interest income in a rising and falling rate scenario. Between June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company&#8217;s modeled sensitivity slightly decreased under a ramp simulation under the upward interest rate scenarios. 

Economic Value of Equity at Risk 

Economic value of equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows. This calculation is used for asset/liability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank. The fair market values of a bank's assets and liabilities are directly linked to interest rates. In some ways, the economic value approach provides a broader scope than the net income volatility approach since it captures all anticipated cash flows. 

EVE simulation reflects the effect of interest rate shifts on the value of the Company and is used to assess the degree of interest rate risk exposure. In contrast to the earnings perspective, the economic perspective identifies risks arising from repricing or maturity gaps for the life of the balance sheet. Changes in economic value indicate anticipated changes in the value of the bank&#8217;s future cash flows. Thus, the economic perspective can provide a leading indicator of the bank&#8217;s future earnings and capital values. The economic valuation method also reflects those sensitivities across the full maturity spectrum of the bank&#8217;s assets and liabilities. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s EVE sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points in an upward direction as of June 30, 2020 and in both directions as of December 31, 2019: 

Change in Interest Rates (Basis Points) EVE Volatility (1)(2) 

June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 +200 12.8 % 7.0 % +100 6.4 % 3.6 % -100 NM (1.4) % -200 NM (3.5) % 

(1) The percentage change represents net portfolio value of the Company in a stable interest rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios. 

(2) NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

The Company&#8217;s EVE sensitivity for the upward interest rate scenarios increased as of June 30, 2020 compared with the results as of December 31, 2019. The changes in EVE sensitivity during this period were primarily due to the reduced base EVE and the changes in level and shape of the yield curve. 

The Company&#8217;s EVE profile as of June 30, 2020 reflects an asset sensitive EVE position under the upward interest rate scenarios. Given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements, and the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary from those predicted by the Company&#8217;s model. 

Derivatives 

It is the Company&#8217;s policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. However, the Company will, from time to time, enter into derivative transactions in order to reduce its exposure to market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Company believes that these derivative transactions, when properly structured and managed, may provide a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities and against risk in specific transactions. Hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps, forwards and options. Prior to entering into any hedging activities, the Company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies. In addition, the Company enters into derivative transactions in order to assist customers with their risk management objectives, primarily to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices. To economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered into with the Company&#8217;s customers, the Company enters into mirrored derivative contracts with third-party financial institutions. The exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash and/or eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements entered between the Company and the financial institutions. 

The Company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts. This counterparty credit risk is a multidimensional form of risk, affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty, both of which are sensitive to market-induced changes. The Company&#8217;s Credit Risk Management Committee provides oversight of credit risks and the Company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration, tenor limits and collateral. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties, entering into legally enforceable master netting arrangements and requiring collateral arrangements, where possible. The Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to institutional third parties through the use of credit risk participation agreements (&#8220;RPAs&#8221;). Certain derivative contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk. The Company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty&#8217;s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of its derivatives. 

Fair Value Hedges &#8212; The Company had one and two cancellable interest rate swap contracts as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, with original terms of 20 years each. These swap contracts involve the exchange of variable rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. The changes in fair value of the hedged brokered certificates of deposit are expected to be effectively offset by the changes in fair value of the swaps throughout the terms of these contracts. 

Cash Flow Hedges &#8212; As of June 30, 2020, the Company entered into two interest rate swap contracts designated to hedge against the risk of variable cash flow that the Company is exposed to from its variable interest rate borrowings, including FRB discount window borrowing and FHLB advances. For cash flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instruments is recognized in AOCI and reclassified to earnings in the same period during which the hedged cash flows impact earnings. 

Net Investment Hedges &#8212; ASC 830-20, Foreign Currency Matters &#8212; Foreign Currency Transactions and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, allow hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation. The Bank entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its investment in East West Bank (China) Limited, a non-U.S. dollar (&#8220;USD&#8221;) functional currency subsidiary in China. The hedging instruments designated as net investment hedges, involve hedging the risk of changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of a designated monetary amount of the Company&#8217;s net investment in East West Bank (China) Limited, against the risk of adverse changes in the foreign currency exchange rate of the Chinese Renminbi (&#8220;RMB&#8221;). As of June 30, 2020, the outstanding foreign currency forwards effectively hedged approximately 50% of the RMB exposure in East West Bank (China) Limited. The fluctuation in foreign currency translation of the hedged exposure is expected to be offset by changes in the fair value of the forwards. 

Interest Rate Contracts &#8212; The Company offers various interest rate derivative contracts to its customers. When derivative transactions are executed with its customers, the derivative contracts are offset by paired trades with third-party financial institutions including with central clearing organizations. Certain derivative contracts entered with central clearing organizations are settled-to-market daily to the extent the central clearing organizations&#8217; rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement. Derivative contracts allow borrowers to lock in attractive intermediate and long-term fixed rate financing while not increasing the interest rate risk to the Company. These transactions are not linked to specific Company assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet or to forecasted transactions in a hedging relationship and, therefore, are economic hedges. The contracts are marked-to-market at each reporting period. The changes in fair values of the derivative contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the derivative transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts, except for the credit valuation adjustment component. The Company records credit valuation adjustments on derivatives to properly reflect the variances of credit worthiness between the Company and the counterparties, considering the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements. 

Foreign Exchange Contracts &#8212; The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts with its customers, consisting of forward, spot, swap and option contracts to accommodate the business needs of its customers. For the foreign exchange contracts entered into with its customers, the Company managed its foreign exchange exposure by entering into offsetting foreign exchange contracts with third-party financial institutions and/or entering into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements with customer counterparties to manage its credit exposure. The changes in the fair values entered with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the foreign exchange transactions executed with the customers throughout the terms of these contracts. The Company also utilizes foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the economic effect of fluctuations in certain foreign currency on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, primarily foreign currency denominated deposits offered to its customers. The Company&#8217;s policies permit taking proprietary currency positions within approved limits, in compliance with the proprietary trading exemption provided under Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). The Company does not speculate in the foreign exchange markets, and actively manages its foreign exchange exposures within prescribed risk limits and defined controls. 

Credit Contracts &#8212; The Company may periodically enter into RPAs to manage the credit exposure on interest rate contracts associated with its syndicated loans. The Company may enter into protection sold or protection purchased RPAs with institutional counterparties. Under the RPA, the Company will receive or make a payment if a borrower defaults on the related interest rate contract. The Company manages its credit risk on the RPAs by monitoring the credit worthiness of the borrowers, which is based on the Company&#8217;s normal credit review process. 

Equity Contracts &#8212; As part of the loan origination process, from time to time, the Company obtained warrants to purchase preferred and/or common stock of technology and life sciences companies to which it provides loans. The warrants included on the Consolidated Financial Statements were from public and private companies. 

Commodity Contracts &#8212; The Company entered into energy commodity contracts with its customers to allow them to hedge against the risk of fluctuation in energy commodity prices. To economically hedge against the risk of fluctuation in commodity prices in the products offered to its customers, the Company enters into offsetting commodity contracts with third-party financial institutions including with central clearing organizations. Certain derivative contracts entered with central clearing organizations are settled to market daily to the extent the central clearing organizations&#8217; rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement. The changes in fair values of the energy commodity contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the energy commodity transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts. 

Additional information on the Company&#8217;s derivatives is presented in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K , Note 3 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Note 6 &#8212; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. 

Impact of Inflation 

The consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared according to GAAP, which require the measurement of financial and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs and the effect that inflation may have on both short-term and long-term interest rates. Since almost all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. While inflation expectations do affect interest rates, interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies and use of estimates are fundamental to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. Some accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. In addition, some significant accounting policies require significant judgments in applying complex accounting principles to individual transaction and determining the most appropriate treatment. The Company has procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For significant accounting policies and use of estimates of allowance for credit losses, see Note 2 &#8212; Current Accounting Developments and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Form 10-Q; and for all other significant accounting policies and use of estimates, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K. 

Certain accounting policies are considered to have a critical effect on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s judgment. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that require the most complex or subjective judgments and are reflective of significant uncertainties, and whose actual results could differ from the Company&#8217;s estimates. Future changes in the key variables could change future valuations and impact the results of operations. In each area, the Company has identified the most important variables in the estimation process. The Company has used the best information available to make the estimations necessary for the related assets and liabilities. The following accounting policies are critical to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements as they require management to make subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain where actual results could differ materially from the Company&#8217;s estimates: 

&#8226; fair value of financial instruments; 

&#8226; allowance for credit losses; 

&#8226; goodwill impairment; and 

&#8226; income taxes.

Supplemental Information &#8212; Explanation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement the Company&#8217;s unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company&#8217;s performance that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure may also be a financial metric that is not required by GAAP or other applicable requirement. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance, and allow comparability to prior periods. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. 

During the second quarter of 2020, the Company prepaid $150.0 million of repurchase agreements and incurred a debt extinguishment cost of $8.7 million . During the first and second quarters of 2019, the Company recorded a $7.0 million pre-tax impairment charge and reversed $30.1 million of certain previously claimed tax credits related to DC Solar, respectively. 

The following tables present the reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the periods presented:

Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking information about us that is intended to be covered by the safe harbor for &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company&#8217;s industry, management&#8217;s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond the Company&#8217;s control, particularly with regard to developments related to COVID-19. These statements relate to the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance or business. They usually can be identified by the use of forward-looking language, such as &#8220;likely result in,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;forecasts,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;intends to,&#8221; &#8220;assumes,&#8221; or may include other similar words or phrases, such as &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;trend,&#8221; &#8220;objective,&#8221; &#8220;continues,&#8221; &#8220;remains,&#8221; or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs, such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;can,&#8221; or similar verbs, and the negative thereof. You should not place undue reliance on these statements, as they are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in the documents incorporated by reference. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind these risks and uncertainties, as well as any cautionary statements the Company may make. Moreover, you should treat these statements as speaking only as of the date they are made and based only on information then actually known to the Company. 

There are a number of important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences, some of which are beyond the Company&#8217;s control, include, but are not limited to 

&#8226; the impact of disease pandemics, such as the worldwide spread of COVID-19, on the Company, its operations and its customers, employees and the markets in which the Company operates and in which its loans are concentrated; and the measures that international, federal, state and local governments, agencies, law enforcement and/or health authorities implement to address it, which may precipitate or exacerbate one or more of the below-mentioned and/or other risks, and significantly disrupt or prevent the Company from operating its business in the ordinary course for an extended period;

&#8226; impact of natural or man-made disasters or calamities, such as wildfires, or conflicts or other events that may directly or indirectly result in a negative impact on the Company&#8217;s financial performance. 

In addition to the risk factors enumerated above, the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could cause actual outcome to differ, possibly materially, from the Company&#8217;s forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond the Company&#8217;s control. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company&#8217;s business. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company will depend on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic and its impact on the Company&#8217;s customers, the actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic as well as its impact on global and regional economies, and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, among others. 

For a more detailed discussion of some of the factors that might cause such differences, see the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors and the information set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-Q. The Company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of events or circumstances after the date of such statements except as required by law.
