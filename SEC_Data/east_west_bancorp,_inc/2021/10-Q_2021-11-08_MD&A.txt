Coronavirus Disease 2019 Global Pandemic 

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) pandemic has created a historic public health crisis and caused unprecedented disruptions to global economies. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government has taken various steps to combat the disease and enacted a number of monetary and fiscal policies to provide fiscal stimulus and relief. Although the COVID-19 pandemic continues to present public health challenges, including the emergence of new variants, great progress has been made and continues to be made in virus containment and vaccination efforts. While these responses have largely mitigated the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and propelled the U.S. economy to recovery, the resurgence of the pandemic, the adoption and long-term effectiveness of the vaccines, and other factors including the continuing impact on global supply chains may slow down such progress. As a result, we are unable to quantify all the specific impacts, and the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, regulatory capital, and liquidity ratios for the remainder of 2021. The Company has been, and may continue to be, impacted by the pandemic. 

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has been focusing on serving our customers and communities and maintaining the well-being of our employees. 

On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (&#8220;ARPA&#8221;) to provide additional relief for individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;). The PPP Extension Act of 2021, enacted on March 30, 2021, extended the PPP through May 31, 2021. The Company has been a participating lender in the PPP since 2020. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had approximately 3,600 PPP loans outstanding with balances totaling $807.3 million, which were recorded in the commercial and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;) loan portfolio. During the first nine months of 2021, the Company submitted and received Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) approval for the forgiveness of approximately 7,800 PPP loans, totaling $1.64 billion. 

The Company also participated in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System&#8217;s (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) Main Street Lending Program (&#8220;MSLP&#8221;) and funded $233.6 million in MSLP loans as of December 31, 2020. As part of the MSLP, the related Main Street special purpose vehicle purchased 95% participations in the loans originated. The portion retained by the Company totaled $9.9 million and $9.5 million as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The MSLP was terminated on January 8, 2021. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has implemented protocols and processes to execute its business continuity plans to protect its employees and support its customers. As state and local governments have relaxed restrictions on temporary business closures, we have started phasing in the return of our U.S.-based corporate associates to the office. The Company continues to monitor the external environment and make changes to its safety protocols as appropriate. For additional information on the PPP and other U.S. government facilities, programs and loan modification relief as established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (&#8220;CARES Act&#8221;), and our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Overview &#8212; Coronavirus Disease 2019 Global Pandemic section in the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

Further discussion of the potential impacts on our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic is provided in Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K.

Financial Review 

The Company&#8217;s net income for the third quarter 2021 was $225.4 million or $1.57 per diluted share, compared with third quarter 2020 net income of $159.5 million or $1.12 per diluted share, an increase of $65.9 million or 41%. Net income for the first nine months of 2021 was $655.2 million or $4.58 per diluted share, compared with the first nine months of 2020 net income of $403.7 million or $2.82 per diluted share, an increase of $251.5 million or 62%. The increases in both periods were due to higher net interest income and noninterest income, reversals of provision for credit losses in the second and third quarter of 2021, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and income tax expense. 

Noteworthy items about the Company&#8217;s performance for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 included: 

&#8226; As of September 30, 2021, total assets were $60.96 billion, an increase of $8.80 billion or 17% from $52.16 billion as of December 31, 2020. 

&#8226; Total loans were $40.48 billion as of September 30, 2021, an increase of $2.09 billion or 5% from $38.39 billion as of December 31, 2020. Total loan growth was well-diversified across the Company&#8217;s major loan portfolios, including residential mortgage, commercial real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) and C&#38;I. 

&#8226; Total deposits were $53.36 billion as of September 30, 2021, an increase of $8.50 billion or 19% from $44.86 billion as of December 31, 2020. Total deposits&#8217; growth was primarily driven by growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and money market accounts. 

&#8226; Asset quality metrics improved. As of September 30, 2021, criticized loans totaled $1.01 billion or 2.50% of loans held-for-investment, a decrease of $207.2 million or 17%, compared with $1.22 billion or 3.17% of loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2020. Nonperforming assets were $172.6 million or 0.28% of total assets as of September 30, 2021, a decrease of $62.3 million or 26%, compared with $234.9 million or 0.45% of total assets as of December 31, 2020. 

&#8226; The Company recorded a reversal of provision for credit losses in 2021, primarily due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, the Company recorded a reversal of credit losses of $10.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively, compared with a provision for credit losses of $10.0 million and $186.3 million for the same periods in 2020, respectively. 

&#8226; Profitability expanded in 2021. Third quarter 2021 ROA was 1.46%, compared with 1.26% for the third quarter of 2020. First nine months of 2021 ROA was 1.50%, compared with 1.13% for the first nine months of 2020. Third quarter 2021 ROE was 15.75%, compared with 12.50% for the third quarter of 2020. First nine months of 2021 ROE was 15.98%, compared with 10.73% for the first nine months of 2020. 

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income 

The Company&#8217;s primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by several factors, including changes in average balances and the composition of interest-earning assets and funding sources, market interest rate fluctuations and the slope of the yield curve, repricing characteristics and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, volume of noninterest-bearing sources of funds, and asset quality. 

Third quarter 2021 net interest income before provision for credit losses was $395.7 million, an increase of $71.6 million or 22%, compared with third quarter 2020 net interest income of $324.1 million. Third quarter 2021 net interest margin was 2.70%, a decrease of two basis points (&#8220;bps&#8221;) from 2.72% for the third quarter of 2020. The change in net interest income and net interest margin primarily reflected higher interest income from loans and AFS debt securities due to volume growth, and a lower cost of time and money market deposits. Net interest income for the first nine months of 2021 was $1.13 billion, an increase of $95.3 million or 9%, compared with $1.03 billion for the first nine months of 2020. Net interest margin was 2.72% for the first nine months of 2021, a decrease of 33 bps from 3.05% for the first nine months of 2020. The changes in net interest income and net interest margin primarily benefited from a lower cost of time and money market deposits, higher interest income from AFS debt securities due to volume growth, partially offset by lower interest income on loans due to yield compression. The increase in average interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks, which earned an average yield of 0.25% and 0.26% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively, also contributed to net interest margin compression. 

Average interest-earning assets were $58.24 billion for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of $10.81 billion or 23% from $47.43 billion for the third quarter of 2020. For the first nine months of 2021, the average interest-earning assets were $55.35 billion, an increase of $10.27 billion or 23% from $45.08 billion for the first nine months of 2020. The year-over-year increases in average interest-earning assets for both periods reflect growth in the average balances of AFS debt securities, loans, and interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks. 

The yield on average interest-earning assets for the third quarter of 2021 was 2.83%, a decrease of 24 bps from 3.07% for the third quarter of 2020, primarily reflecting an increase in lower yielding AFS debt securities and interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks in the earnings asset mix. The yield on average interest-earning assets for the first nine months of 2021 was 2.89%, a decrease of 71 bps from 3.60% for the first nine months of 2020, primarily reflecting compression in average loan yields. 

Average loan yield was 3.61% for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of one bp from 3.60% for the third quarter of 2020. Average loan yield for the first nine months of 2021 was 3.59%, a decrease of 49 bps from 4.08% for the first nine months of 2020. Excluding the impacts of PPP loans, the adjusted average loan yield was 3.56% and 3.70% for the third quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively, and 3.58% and 4.10% for the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, respectively. For additional details, see the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-Q. Approximately 65% of loans held-for-investment were variable-rate or hybrid loans in their adjustable rate period as of both September 30, 2021 and 2020. 

Deposits are an important source of funds and impact both net interest income and net interest margin. The average cost of deposits was 0.12% for the third quarter of 2021, a 21 bp decrease from 0.33% for the third quarter of 2020. The average cost of deposits was 0.15% for the first nine months of 2021, a 38 bp decrease from 0.53% for the same period in 2020. The year-over-year decreases reflected a lower interest rate environment in 2021, as well as the year-over-year run-off of higher rate time deposits. The higher proportion of noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which comprised 43% and 40% of average total deposits for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, compared with 35% and 33% for the same periods of 2020, respectively, also contributed to the decrease in the average cost of deposits. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.21% for the third quarter of 2021, a 29 bp decrease from 0.50% for the third quarter of 2020. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.25% for the first nine months of 2021, a 54 bp decrease from 0.79% for the same period in 2020. 

The average cost of funds was 0.14% for the third quarter of 2021, a decrease of 24 bps from 0.38% for the third quarter of 2020. For the first nine months of 2021, the average cost of funds was 0.18%, a decrease of 41 bps from 0.59% for the first nine months of 2020. The decrease in the average cost of funds reflected the lower cost of deposits, as well as decreases in other sources of funding due to changes in the interest rate environment. Other sources of funding included FHLB advances, assets sold under repurchase agreements (&#8220;repurchase agreements&#8221;), long-term debt and short-term borrowings. 

The Company utilizes various tools to manage interest rate risk. Refer to the Interest Rate Risk Management section of Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Market Risk Management in this Form 10-Q.

Noninterest income comprised 16% of total revenue for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, compared with 14% for the same periods in 2020. Third quarter 2021 noninterest income was $73.1 million, an increase of $18.6 million or 34%, compared with $54.5 million for the same period in 2020. This increase was primarily due to increases in foreign exchange income and deposit account fees. Noninterest income for the first nine months of 2021 was $214.4 million, an increase of $48.7 million or 29%, compared with $165.7 million for the same period in 2020. This increase was primarily due to increases in foreign exchange income, deposit account fees, wealth management fees, other investment income, and gains on sales of loans, partially offset by a decrease in gains on sales of AFS debt securities. 

Deposit account fees increased $5.9 million or 47% to $18.5 million for the third quarter of 2021, and increased $17.3 million or 51% to $51.2 million for the first nine months of 2021, compared with the same periods in 2020. These increases primarily reflected an increase in treasury management service fees resulting from commercial deposit growth. 

Foreign exchange income increased $9.8 million or 296% to $13.1 million for the third quarter of 2021, and increased $19.9 million or 127% to $35.6 million for the first nine months of 2021, compared with the same periods in 2020. These increases reflected new customer acquisitions and growth in customer-driven transactions, favorable revaluation of foreign currency transactions, as well as remeasurement of certain foreign currency-denominated balance sheet items. 

Wealth management fees increased $1.0 million or 23% to $5.6 million for the third quarter of 2021, and increased $7.5 million or 57% to $20.5 million for the first nine months of 2021, compared with the same periods in 2020. These increases were primarily due to growth in customer-driven transactions. 

Net gains on sales of loans increased $3.0 million or 822% to $3.3 million for the third quarter of 2021, and increased $5.2 million or 357% to $6.6 million for the first nine months of 2021, compared with the same periods in 2020. These increases were primarily due to a higher volume of SBA loan sold. 

Gains on sales of AFS debt securities decreased $344 thousand or 49% to $354 thousand for the third quarter of 2021, compared with the same period in 2020. Gains on sales of AFS debt securities decreased $10.7 million or 90% to $1.2 million for the first nine months of 2021, compared with the same period in 2020. The decrease for the first nine months of 2021, compared with the same period in 2020, was primarily due to a lower volume of AFS debt securities sold. 

Other investment income increased $110 thousand or 2% to $5.3 million for the third quarter of 2021, and increased $7.2 million or 109% to $13.9 million for the first nine months of 2021, compared with the same periods in 2020. These increases primarily reflected higher earnings from equity method investments. 

Noninterest Expense 

The following table presents the components of noninterest expense for the third quarters and first nine months of 2021 and 2020:

Third quarter 2021 noninterest expense was $205.4 million, an increase of $32.8 million or 19%, compared with $172.6 million for the same period in 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher amortization of tax credit and other investments, compensation and employee benefits, and other operating expense. First nine months of 2021 noninterest expense was $586.0 million, an increase of $48.3 million or 9%, compared with $537.7 million for the same period in 2020. The increase primarily reflected higher amortization of tax credit and other investments, and compensation and employee benefits. 

Compensation and employee benefits increased $6.0 million or 6% to $105.8 million for the third quarter of 2021, and increased $20.3 million or 7% to $319.0 million for the first nine months of 2021, compared with the same periods in 2020. These increases were primarily due to higher bonus accruals. 

The increase in other operating expense of $3.9 million or 23% to $21.0 million for the third quarter of 2021, compared with the same period in 2020, was primarily due to higher charitable contributions. Other operating expense was $58.5 million and $57.5 million for the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Amortization of tax credit and other investments increased $20.8 million or 121% to $38.0 million for the third quarter of 2021, and increased $32.9 million or 57% to $90.7 million for the first nine months of 2021, compared with the same periods in 2020. These increases were primarily due to the timing of the tax credit recognition in each period, based on when new tax credit projects were put into service. 

During the second quarter of 2020, the Company prepaid $150.0 million of repurchase agreements and incurred a debt extinguishment cost of $8.7 million. No such expense was incurred in either the third quarter or first nine months of 2021. 

Efficiency ratio, calculated as noninterest expense divided by total revenue, was 43.81% and 45.58% for the third quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively, and 43.72% and 44.94% for the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, respectively. Non-GAAP efficiency ratio, adjusted for the amortization of tax credit and other investments and the amortization of core deposit intangibles, improved 524 bps to 35.55% for the third quarter of 2021, and improved 234 bps to 36.80% for the first nine months of 2021, compared with the same periods in 2020. For additional details, see the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-Q.

Third quarter 2021 income tax expense was $48.0 million and the effective tax rate was 17.5%, compared with third quarter 2020 income tax expense of $36.5 million and effective tax rate of 18.6%. The decrease in effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021, compared with the same period in 2020 was primarily due to the relative impact of tax credit investments on income tax expense. For the first nine months of 2021, income tax expense was $124.1 million and the effective tax rate was 15.9%, compared with income tax expense of $68.6 million and effective tax rate of 14.5% for the same period in 2020. The year-over-year increase in effective tax rate was predominantly driven by a higher level of income before income taxes, as well as the relative impact of tax credit investments on income tax expense in each period. 

Operating Segment Results 

The Company organizes its operations into three reportable operating segments: (1) Consumer and Business Banking; (2) Commercial Banking; and (3) Other.

For the third quarter of 2021, segment net income increased $33.5 million or 77% year-over-year to $76.8 million , driven by revenue growth, partially offset by increases in income tax expense, noninterest expense, and the provision for credit losses. Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased $55.7 million or 46% to $176.7 million , driven by lower interest expense, primarily due to lower interest rates and growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits; and higher interest income, primarily due to growth in residential mortgage loans. Noninterest income increased $5.0 million or 29% to $22.4 million, primarily due to higher foreign exchange income and deposit account fees, reflecting growth in customer-driven transactions. Noninterest expense increased $9.2 million or 11% to $90.6 million, primarily due to higher allocated corporate overhead, and compensation and employee benefits. 

For the first nine months of 2021, segment net income increased $81.2 million or 60% year-over-year to $215.7 million, due to revenue growth and a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher income tax expense and noninterest expense. Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased $101.9 million or 26% to $500.4 million, driven by higher interest income, primarily due to growth in residential mortgage loans; and lower interest expense, primarily due to growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and lower interest rates. Noninterest income increased $20.0 million or 42% to $67.7 million, primarily due to higher foreign exchange income, deposit account fees, and wealth management fees, partially offset by lower interest rate contracts and other derivative income. Noninterest expense increased $19.0 million or 8% to $267.5 million, primarily from increased compensation and employee benefits, and allocated corporate overhead. 

Commercial Banking 

The Commercial Banking segment primarily offers commercial loan and deposit products. Commercial loan products include commercial business loans and lines of credit, trade finance loans and letters of credit, CRE loans, construction and land lending, affordable housing loans and letters of credit, asset-based lending, and equipment financing.

For the third quarter of 2021, segment net income increased $43.4 million or 52% year-over-year to $126.8 million, driven by revenue growth and a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher income tax expense and noninterest expense. Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased $26.9 million or 17% to $189.8 million, driven by higher interest income, due to more PPP loan-related income and growth in commercial loans; and lower interest expense due to growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Noninterest income increased $13.9 million or 48% to $42.9 million, reflecting higher foreign exchange income, deposit account fees, gains on sales of loans, and interest rate contracts and other derivative income. Noninterest expense increased $4.8 million or 8% to $66.7 million, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits. 

For the first nine months of 2021, segment net income increased $184.0 million or 102% year-over-year to $364.6 million, reflecting a lower provision for credit losses and revenue growth, partially offset by higher income tax expense and noninterest expense. Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased $29.4 million or 6% to $559.6 million, driven by lower interest expense, due to lower interest rates and growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits; partially offset by lower interest income, due to compression in commercial loan yields. Noninterest income increased $30.2 million or 32% to $125.5 million, reflecting higher foreign exchange income, deposit account fees, interest rate contracts and other derivative income, and gains on sales of loans. Noninterest expense increased $3.2 million or 2% to $200.1 million, due to increases in compensation and employee benefits, and deposit related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in loan related expense. 

Other 

Centralized functions, including the corporate treasury activities of the Company and eliminations of inter-segment amounts, have been aggregated and included in the Other segment, which provides broad administrative support to the two core segments, namely the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments.

Net interest income before provision for credit losses decreased $11.0 million or 27% to $29.2 million. The decrease was primarily driven by lower FTP spread income absorbed by the Other segment, partially offset by growth in interest income from investments due to a higher volume of AFS debt securities. Noninterest expense increased $18.8 million or 64% to $48.1 million, primarily due to higher amortization of tax credits and other investments. 

Segment net income decreased $13.7 million or 15% year-over-year to $74.8 million for the first nine months of 2021. Net interest income before provision for credit losses decreased $36.0 million or 35% to $65.9 million. The decrease was primarily driven by lower FTP spread income absorbed by the Other segment, partially offset by growth in interest income from investments due to a higher volume of AFS debt securities. Noninterest expense increased $26.1 million or 28% to $118.4 million, primarily driven by higher amortization of tax credits and other investments. 

Balance Sheet Analysis 

Debt Securities 

The Company maintains a portfolio of high quality and liquid debt securities with moderate durations to minimize overall interest rate and liquidity risks. The Company&#8217;s debt securities provide: 

&#8226; interest income for earnings and yield enhancement; 

&#8226; availability for funding needs arising during the normal course of business; 

&#8226; the ability to execute interest rate risk management strategies in response to changes in economic or market conditions; and 

&#8226; collateral to support pledging agreements as required and/or to enhance the Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity. 

Available-for-Sale Debt Securities 

Debt securities classified as AFS are carried at their fair value with the corresponding changes in fair value recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as a component of Stockholders&#8217; equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

The following table presents the distribution of the Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities portfolio by fair value and percentage of portfolio as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and by credit ratings as of September 30, 2021:

The fair value of AFS debt securities totaled $9.71 billion as of September 30, 2021, an increase of $4.17 billion or 75% from $5.54 billion as of December 31, 2020. The largest changes came from U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities, which increased $1.25 billion, followed by U.S. Treasury securities, which increased $891.0 million, and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, which increased $836.4 million. 

The Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities portfolio had an effective duration, defined as the sensitivity of the value of the portfolio to interest rate changes, of 5.3 as of September 30, 2021. This increased from 4.2 as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to the steepening of the yield curve. As of September 30, 2021, 90% of the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s debt securities portfolio was rated &#8220;AA-,&#8221; &#8220;Aa3&#8221; or higher by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, compared with 88% as of December 31, 2020. Credit ratings of BBB- or higher by S&#38;P and Fitch, or Baa3 or higher by Moody&#8217;s, are considered investment grade. 

The Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities are carried at fair value with non-credit related unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Pre-tax net unrealized losses on AFS debt securities were $70.2 million as of September 30, 2021, compared with pre-tax net unrealized gains on AFS debt securities of $74.1 million as of December 31, 2020. This change was primarily due to interest rate movement and the widening of liquidity spreads. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had no intention to sell securities with unrealized losses and believed it is more-likely-than-not that it would not be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized costs. 

Of the securities with gross unrealized losses, substantially all were rated investment grade as of both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, based upon the lowest of the credit ratings issued by S&#38;P, Moody&#8217;s, or Fitch. The Company believes that the gross unrealized losses were due to non-credit related factors, and were primarily attributable to yield curve movement. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been reduced by the government&#8217;s aggressive monetary policy, including benchmark rate cuts and various relief measures that contributed to the gradual and steady recovery of the market to pre-pandemic levels. The Company believes that the credit support levels of its AFS debt securities are strong and, based on current assessments and macroeconomic forecasts, expects that full contractual cash flows will be received. 

The Company assesses individual security for credit losses for each reporting period. If a credit loss is identified, the Company records an impairment related to credit losses through the allowance for credit losses with a corresponding Provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. There were no credit losses recognized in earnings for both the third quarters and first nine months of 2021 and 2020. For a description of the policies, methodologies and judgments used to determine the allowance for credit losses, see Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K and Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-Sale Debt Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

The following table presents the weighted-average yields and contractual maturity distribution, excluding periodic principal payments, of the Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Actual maturities of certain securities can differ from contractual maturities as the borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties. In addition, factors such as prepayments and interest rates may affect the yields on the carrying values of these securities.

Loan Portfolio 

The Company offers a broad range of financial products designed to meet the credit needs of its borrowers. The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio segments include commercial loans, which consist of C&#38;I, CRE, multifamily residential, and construction and land loans; and consumer loans, which consist of single-family residential, home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;), and other consumer loans. Total net loans were $39.92 billion as of September 30, 2021, an increase of $2.15 billion or 6% from $37.77 billion as of December 31, 2020. This was primarily driven by well-diversified growth across our key loan portfolios including $1.20 billion or 12% in residential mortgage loans, $727.1 million or 5% in total CRE loans, and $199.9 million or 1% in C&#38;I loans. The composition of the loan portfolio was largely similar as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Approximately 90% of total CRE loans had an LTV ratio of 65% or lower as of September 30, 2021, compared with 89% as of December 31, 2020. The consistency of the Company&#8217;s low LTV underwriting standards has historically resulted in lower credit losses for income-producing CRE and multifamily residential loans. 

The following tables provide a summary of the Company&#8217;s income-producing CRE, multifamily residential, and construction and land loans by geography as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Deposits and Other Sources of Funds 

Deposits are the Company&#8217;s primary source of funding, the cost of which has a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s net interest income and net interest margin. Additional funding is provided by short- and long-term borrowings, and long-term debt. See Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity in this Form 10-Q for a discussion of the Company&#8217;s liquidity management. The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s sources of funds as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020:

Deposits 

The Company offers a wide variety of deposit products to consumer and commercial customers. To provide a stable and low-cost source of funding and liquidity, the Company&#8217;s strategy is to grow and retain relationship-based deposits. 

Total deposits were $53.36 billion as of September 30, 2021, an increase of $8.49 billion or 19% from $44.86 billion as of December 31, 2020. Deposit growth was attributable to strong growth in non-maturity deposits partially offset by a reduction in higher-cost time deposits, from both commercial and consumer customers. The strongest growth was in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which grew by $6.88 billion or 42% from December 31, 2020. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits were $23.18 billion or 44% of total deposits as of September 30, 2021, up from $16.30 billion or 36% of total deposits as of December 31, 2020. Additional information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest income, with a comparison of average deposit balances and rates, is provided in Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Results of Operations &#8212; Net Interest Income in this Form 10-Q. 

Other Sources of Funding 

There were no short-term borrowings as of September 30, 2021. Short-term borrowings of $21.0 million as of December 31, 2020 consisted of borrowings entered into by the Company&#8217;s subsidiary, East West Bank (China) Limited. 

FHLB advances were $248.9 million as of September 30, 2021, a decrease of $403.7 million from $652.6 million as of December 31, 2020. As of September 30, 2021, FHLB advances had floating interest rates ranging from 0.52% to 0.56% and remaining maturities between five months and 1.1 years. 

Gross repurchase agreements totaled $300.0 million as of both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Resale and repurchase agreements are reported net, pursuant to ASC 210-20-45-11, Balance Sheet Offsetting: Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements . As of both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any gross resale agreements that were eligible for netting. As of September 30, 2021, gross repurchase agreements had interest rates ranging from 2.35% to 2.40%, with original terms between 4.0 years and 8.5 years and remaining maturities between 1.8 years and 1.9 years. 

Repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded as liabilities based on the values at which the assets are sold. As of September 30, 2021, the collateral for the repurchase agreements was comprised of U.S. Treasury securities, and U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities. To ensure the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, the Company monitors the fair value of collateral pledged relative to the principal amounts borrowed under the repurchase agreements. The Company manages liquidity risks related to the repurchase agreements by sourcing funds from a diverse group of counterparties, and entering into repurchase agreements with longer durations, when appropriate. For additional details, see Note 3 &#8212; Assets Purchased under Resale Agreements and Sold under Repurchase Agreements to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The Company uses long-term debt to provide funding to acquire interest-earning assets, and to enhance liquidity and regulatory capital adequacy. Long-term debt totaled $147.6 million and $147.4 million as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Long-term debt consists of junior subordinated debt, which qualifies as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes. The junior subordinated debt was issued in connection with the Company&#8217;s various pooled trust preferred securities offerings, as well as with common stock issued by the six wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company in conjunction with these offerings. The junior subordinated debt had a weighted-average interest rate of 1.74% and 2.41% for the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, respectively, with remaining maturities ranging between 13.2 years and 16.0 years as of September 30, 2021. 

Regulatory Capital and Ratios 

The federal banking agencies have risk-based capital adequacy requirements intended to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that is commensurate with the degree of risk associated with a banking organization&#8217;s operations. The Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements. The Bank is a member bank of the Federal Reserve System and is primarily regulated by the Federal Reserve and the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (&#8220;DFPI&#8221;). The Company and the Bank are required to comply with the Basel III Capital Rules adopted by the federal banking agencies. Both the Company and the Bank are standardized approach institutions under Basel III Capital Rules. See Item 1. Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Regulatory Capital Requirements and &#8212; Recent Regulatory Capital-Related Development of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K for additional details. 

The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. The Company has elected the phase-in option provided by the regulatory guidance, which delays the estimated impact of Current Expected Credit Losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) on regulatory capital for two years and phases the impact over three years. As a result, the effects of CECL on the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s regulatory capital will be delayed through the year 2021, after which the effects will be phased-in over a three-year period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. In April 2020, in recognition of the CARES Act requirements, and to facilitate the use of the PPPLF, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that banking organizations may exclude from leverage and risk-based capital requirements any eligible assets sold or pledged to the Federal Reserve on a non-recourse basis as part of the PPPLF. In addition, under the CARES Act, loans originated by a banking organization under the PPP (whether or not sold or pledged in the PPPLF) will be risk-weighted at zero percent for regulatory capital purposes. Accordingly, the September 30, 2021 capital ratios exclude the impact of the increased allowance for loan losses due to CECL, and PPP loans are risk-weighted at zero percent. As of September 30, 2021, the Company did not have any PPPLF outstanding. Accordingly, there were no PPP loans pledged as collateral. The PPPLF ceased extending credit on July 30, 2021. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 under the Basel III Capital Rules, and those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well-capitalized classification purposes:

(1) The CET1 capital and Tier 1 leverage components of the &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; requirements apply only to the Bank since there is no CET1 or Tier 1 leverage ratio component in the regulatory definition of a well-capitalized bank-holding company. In addition, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio requirement for the Company to be considered well-capitalized is 6.0%. 

(2) As of January 1, 2019, the 2.5% capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital ratios was required in order to avoid limitations on distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. 

The Company is committed to maintaining strong capital levels to assure the Company&#8217;s investors, customers and regulators that the Company and the Bank are financially sound. As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, both the Company and the Bank continued to exceed all &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; capital requirements and the fully phased-in required minimum capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules. Total risk-weighted assets were $42.13 billion as of September 30, 2021, an increase of $3.72 billion or 10% from $38.41 billion as of December 31, 2020. The increase in the risk-weighted assets was primarily due to loan growth and increased AFS debt securities. 

Other Matters 

London Interbank Offered Rate Transition 

On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) confirmed that the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar (&#8220;USD&#8221;) London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) settings will permanently cease following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and that the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month USD LIBOR settings will permanently cease following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. The federal banking agencies have continued to encourage banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (&#8220;ARRC&#8221;) has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) as its preferred alternative to LIBOR, although the adoption of SOFR remains voluntary. The ARRC has also formally recommended the CME Group&#8217;s forward-looking SOFR term rates. The ARRC supports the use of SOFR term rates for business loan activity and continues to recommend using forms of overnight and averages of SOFR where possible. On October 6, 2021, the ARRC released a summary of its spread-adjusted fallback recommendations for contracts referencing USD LIBOR. 

A majority of the Company&#8217;s LIBOR-based loans, derivatives, debt securities, resale agreements, junior subordinated debt and repurchase agreements are indexed to LIBOR tenors that will cease to be published after June 30, 2023. The volume of the Company&#8217;s LIBOR-based products that mature after June 30, 2023 is significant and, if not sufficiently planned for, the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in financial, operational, legal, reputational or compliance risks to the Company. 

The transition is anticipated to span several reporting periods through mid-2023 with the confirmed LIBOR cessation dates. The Company created a cross-functional team to manage the communication of the Company&#8217;s transition plans with both internal and external stakeholders and to ensure that the Company appropriately updates its business processes, analytical tools, information systems and contract language to minimize disruptions during and after the LIBOR transition. The Company has taken steps to transition LIBOR contracts maturing after the LIBOR cessation dates to alternative rates. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company will no longer extend new LIBOR-based loans as a primary offering to customers. The Company will offer new variable rate loans based on alternative reference rates. For additional information related to the potential impact surrounding the transition from LIBOR on the Company&#8217;s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the ordinary course of the Company&#8217;s business, the Company may enter into or be a party to transactions that are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are considered to be off-balance sheet arrangements. Off-balance sheet arrangements are any contractual arrangements to which a nonconsolidated entity is a party and under which the Company has: (1) any obligation under a guarantee contract; (2) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets; (3) any obligation under certain derivative instruments; or (4) any obligation under a material variable interest held by the Company in a nonconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the Company. 

Commitments to Extend Credit 

As a financial service provider, the Company routinely enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, commercial letters of credit for foreign and domestic trade, standby letters of credit (&#8220;SBLCs&#8221;) and financial guarantees to meet the financing needs of its customers. Many of these commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. The credit policies used in underwriting loans to customers are also used to extend these commitments. Under some of these contractual agreements, the Company may also have liabilities contingent upon the occurrence of certain events. The Company&#8217;s liquidity sources have been, and are expected to be, sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its lending activities. 

Guarantees 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company periodically enters into various guarantee agreements in which the Company sells or securitizes loans with recourse. Under these guarantee arrangements, the Company is contingently obligated to repurchase the recourse component of the loans when the loans default. 

Further information and discussion about the Company&#8217;s loan commitments, commercial letters of credit, SBLCs, guarantees, and significant contractual arrangements under which the Company may be held contingently liable is included in Note 9 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. In addition, the Company has commitments and obligations under post-retirement benefit plans as described in Note 14 &#8212; Employee Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K, and has contractual obligations for future payments on debts, borrowings and lease obligations as detailed in Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

Risk Management 

Overview 

In conducting its businesses, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent to the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to the Company&#8217;s businesses. The Company operates under a Board-approved Enterprise Risk Management (&#8220;ERM&#8221;) framework, which outlines the company-wide approach to risk management and oversight, and describes the structures and practices employed to manage the current and emerging risks inherent to the Company. The Company&#8217;s ERM program incorporates risk management throughout the organization in identifying, managing, monitoring, and reporting risks. It identifies the Company&#8217;s major risk categories as credit risk; liquidity risk; capital risk; market risk; operational risk; compliance and regulatory risks; legal risks; strategic risks; and reputational risks. 

The Risk Oversight Committee of the Board of Directors monitors the ERM program through stated risk categories and provides oversight of the Company&#8217;s risk appetite and control environment. The Risk Oversight Committee provides focused oversight of the Company&#8217;s identified enterprise risk categories on behalf of the full Board of Directors. Under the direction of the Risk Oversight Committee, management committees apply targeted strategies to reduce the risks to which the Company&#8217;s operations are exposed. 

The Company&#8217;s ERM program is executed along the three lines of defense model, which provides for a consistent and standardized risk management control environment across the enterprise. The first line of defense is comprised of production, operational, and support units. The second line of defense is comprised of various risk management and control functions charged with monitoring and managing specific major risk categories and/or risk subcategories. The third line of defense is comprised of the Internal Audit function and Independent Asset Review. Internal Audit provides assurance and evaluates the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes as established by the Company. Internal Audit has organizational independence and objectivity, reporting directly to the Board&#8217;s Audit Committee. Further discussion and analysis of each major risk area are included in the following sub-sections of Risk Management. 

Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk is the risk that a borrower or counterparty will fail to perform according to the terms and conditions of a loan or investment and expose the Company to loss. Credit risk exists with many of the Company&#8217;s assets and exposures such as loans and certain derivatives. The majority of the Company&#8217;s credit risk is associated with lending activities. 

The Risk Oversight Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing enterprise risk categories including credit risk. The Risk Oversight Committee monitors management&#8217;s assessment of asset quality and credit risk trends, credit quality administration and underwriting standards, as well as portfolio credit risk management strategies and processes, such as diversification and concentration limits, all of which enable management to control credit risk. At the management level, the Credit Risk Management Committee has primary oversight responsibility for credit risk. The Senior Credit Supervision function manages credit policy and provides the resources to manage the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all exposure is risk-rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy. The Senior Credit Supervision function evaluates and reports the overall credit risk exposure to senior management and the Risk Oversight Committee. The Independent Asset Review function reports directly to the Board&#8217;s Risk Oversight Committee and supports a strong credit risk management culture by providing an independent and objective assessment of underwriting and asset quality of the loan portfolio. A key focus of the Company&#8217;s credit risk management is adherence to a well-controlled underwriting process. 

The Company assesses the overall credit quality performance of the loan held-for-investment portfolio through an integrated analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: Credit Quality, Nonperforming Assets, Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) and Allowance for Credit Losses. 

Credit Quality 

The Company utilizes a credit risk rating system to assist in monitoring credit quality. Loans are evaluated using the Company&#8217;s internal credit risk rating of one through ten. Loans risk rated one through five are assigned an internal risk rating category of &#8220;Pass.&#8221; Loans assigned with a credit risk rating of six have potential weaknesses that warrant closer attention by management and are assigned an internal risk rating category of &#8220;Special mention.&#8221; Loans assigned a credit risk rating of seven or eight have well-defined weaknesses that may jeopardize the full and timely repayment of the loan; these are assigned an internal risk rating category of &#8220;Substandard.&#8221; Loans assigned a credit risk rating of nine have insufficient sources of repayment and a high probability of loss; these are assigned an internal risk rating category of &#8220;Doubtful.&#8221; Loans assigned a credit risk rating of ten are uncollectible and of such little value that they are no longer considered bankable assets; these are assigned an internal risk rating category of &#8220;Loss.&#8221; Exposures categorized as criticized consist of &#8220;Special mention,&#8221; &#8220;Substandard,&#8221; &#8220;Doubtful&#8221; and &#8220;Loss&#8221; categories. Exposures categorized as classified consist of &#8220;Substandard,&#8221; &#8220;Doubtful&#8221; and &#8220;Loss&#8221; categories. For more information on credit quality indicators, refer to Note 6 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s criticized loans as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020:

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans, other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;) and other nonperforming assets. Other nonperforming assets and OREO are repossessed assets and properties, respectively, acquired through foreclosure, or through full or partial satisfaction of loans held-for-investment. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due or when the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain regardless of the length of past due status. Collectability is generally assessed based on economic and business conditions, the borrower&#8217;s financial condition, and the adequacy of collateral, if any. For additional details regarding the Company&#8217;s nonaccrual loan policy, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Loans Held-for-Investment to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K.

Nonaccrual loans decreased $82.0 million or 38% from $215.2 million as of December 31, 2020 to $133.2 million as of September 30, 2021. This decrease was predominantly due to resolutions of C&#38;I oil and gas exposures and CRE loans. 

As of September 30, 2021, C&#38;I comprised 73% and CRE comprised 12% of total nonaccrual loans. As of December 31, 2020, C&#38;I and total CRE loans comprised 62% and 23% of total nonaccrual loans, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, $101.9 million or 77% of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent. In comparison, $106.4 million or 49% of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent as of December 31, 2020. 

OREO was $28.8 million as of September 30, 2021, an increase of $13.0 million or 82% from $15.8 million as of December 31, 2020. The increase was due to an addition of a CRE office property totaling $28.8 million, which the Company took possession of during the third quarter of 2021, offset by a sale of a retail CRE property. 

Other nonperforming assets totaled $10.7 million and $3.9 million as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, a net increase of $6.8 million or 175%, due to transfers from oil and gas loans to foreclosed assets, partially offset by sales and write-downs of oil and gas foreclosed assets.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

TDRs are loans for which contractual terms have been modified by the Company for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, and for which a concession to the borrower was granted that the Company would not otherwise consider. The following table presents the performing and nonperforming TDRs by portfolio segment as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The allowance for loan losses for TDRs was $12.3 million as of September 30, 2021 and $10.3 million as of December 31, 2020.

As of September 30, 2021, performing TDRs were $104.1 million, a decrease of $39.1 million or 27% from $143.2 million as of December 31, 2020. This decrease mainly reflected payoffs of performing C&#38;I and construction TDRs, partially offset by the transfers of C&#38;I TDRs from nonperforming to performing status. Over 95% and 85% of the performing TDRs were current as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Nonperforming TDRs were $77.6 million as of September 30, 2021, an increase of $5.7 million or 8% from $71.9 million as of December 31, 2020 . This increase mainly reflected newly designated nonperforming C&#38;I TDR loans, partially offset by paydowns, payoffs and transfers of certain C&#38;I TDRs from nonperforming to performing status. 

Existing TDRs that were subsequently modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be classified as TDRs. As of September 30, 2021, there were no TDRs that were provided subsequent modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020 , there were four TDRs totaling $11.8 million that were provided subsequent modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Loan Modifications Due to COVID-19 Pandemic 

Since late March 2020, under various forbearance programs, the Company has granted a range of commercial and consumer loan accommodations, predominantly in the form of payment deferrals, to provide relief to borrowers experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (&#8220;CAA&#8221;), permits a financial institution to elect to temporarily suspend TDR accounting under ASC Subtopic 310-40 in certain circumstances. To be eligible under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as modified by the CAA, a loan modification must be (1) related to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of (a) 60 days after the date of termination of the federal National Emergency or (b) January 1, 2022. The federal banking regulators, in consultation with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;), issued the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customer Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised) (the &#8220;Interagency Statement&#8221;) on April 7, 2020 confirming that, for loans not subject to Section 4013 of the CARES Act, short-term modifications (i.e., six months or less) made on a good faith basis in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of a loan modification, or modifications granted under government mandated modification programs, are not considered as TDRs under ASC Subtopic 310-40. See additional information in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Troubled Debt Restructurings to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

The delinquency aging of loans modified related to the COVID-19 pandemic is frozen at the time of the modification. As a result, the recognition of delinquent loans, nonaccrual status and loan net charge-offs may be delayed for certain borrowers who are enrolled in these loan modification programs, which would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status. Interest income continues to be recognized over the accommodation periods. 

The following table provides a summary of the COVID-19 pandemic-related loan modifications that remained under their modified terms as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 . These amounts represent loan modifications that meet the criteria under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, or the Interagency Statement and therefore are not considered as TDRs. These amounts also exclude loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic made on existing TDRs. A loan is counted once in the table regardless of the number of accommodations the borrower has received.

The above table excludes loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not meet the criteria provided under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, or the Interagency Statement, and that were evaluated and deemed to not be classified as TDRs. The determination to not consider a modification a TDR was made on the premise that the amount of the delayed restructured payments was insignificant relative to the unpaid principal or the collateral value of the loan, resulting in an insignificant shortfall in the contractual amount due from the borrower, or an insignificant delay in the timing of the restructured payment period relative to the payment frequency under the loan&#8217;s original contractual maturity or expected duration. 

The COVID-19 pandemic-related loan modifications primarily consisted of payment deferrals six months or less in duration, in the form of either principal payment deferrals, where the borrower was still paying interest, or full principal and interest payment deferrals. Other forbearance programs consisted of interest rate concessions. The deferred payments for commercial loans are either repaid at contractual maturity or spread over the remaining contractual term of the loan. The deferred payments for consumer loans are repaid under defined payment plans between six to 72 months after the deferral period ends, or the loan term is extended beyond the contractual maturity by the number of payments deferred. 

As of September 30, 2021, the Company had $747.0 million of loans under payment deferral and forbearance programs, a decrease of $236.2 million or 24% from $983.2 million as of December 31, 2020. The loans on deferral as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, largely consisted of CRE and residential mortgage loans. The year-to-date decrease in loans on deferral reflected the lifting of COVID-19 related business shutdowns and restrictions on travel and restaurant dining. The increase of CRE COVID-19 related loan deferrals that were making at least partial payments from 73% as of December 31, 2020 to 92% a s of September 30, 2021 also signaled improvements in the economy. Loans that have exited the modification program were predominantly current as of September 30, 2021. The Company monitors the delinquency status of loans exiting relief programs on an ongoing basis. The impacts of the COVID-19 loan modifications were considered in the determination of the allowance for credit loss. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The Company&#8217;s measurement of the allowance for credit losses is based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company&#8217;s relevant financial assets. The allowance for credit losses estimate uses various models and estimation techniques based on historical loss experience, current borrower characteristics, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other relevant factors. In the case of loans and securities, allowance for credit losses are contra-asset valuation accounts that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the case of unfunded credit commitments, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account that is reported as a component of Accrued expenses and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

In addition to the allowance for loan losses, the Company maintains an allowance for unfunded credit commitments. The Company has three general areas for which it provides the allowance for unfunded credit commitments: 1) recourse obligations for loans sold, 2) letters of credit, and 3) unfunded lending commitments. The Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the allowance calculation for unfunded lending commitments uses the lifetime loss rates of the on-balance sheet commitment. Recourse obligations for loans sold and letters of credit use the weighted loss rates for the applicable segment of the individual credit. 

The Company is committed to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at a level that is commensurate with the estimated inherent losses in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit facilities. While the Company believes that the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2021 was appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and in unfunded credit commitments based on the information available, future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, accounting standard and regulatory changes, loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions. For a description of the policies, methodologies and judgments used to determine the allowance for credit losses, see Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K and Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K, and Note 6 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The following table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan portfolio segments and unfunded credit commitments as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 :

The allowance for loan losses was $560.4 million as of September 30, 2021, a decrease of $59.6 million from $620.0 million as of December 31, 2020, primaril y driven by a reduction in the allowance against the C&#38;I loan portfolio. Th e change in th e allowance reflects year-to-date improvement in the macroeconomic forecast, partially offset by loan growth. 

The Company considers multiple economic scenarios to develop the estimate of the allowance for loans. The scenarios may consist of a base forecast representing management's view of the most likely outcome and downside or upside scenarios reflecting possible worsening or improving economic conditions. The base forecast assumed an end to the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic and continuing improvement in the economic outlook, with annual GDP growth estimated at 6.0% and 4.3% for 2021 and 2022, respectively, and the projected unemployment rate declining to 3.4% by the end of 2022. The downside scenario assumed a pullback in the expected economic recovery due to rising concerns with COVID-19 variants and a rise in unemployment. The upside scenario assumed a more optimistic view for the economic recovery, including higher GDP growth through next year and a faster return to full employment. 

As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, PPP loans outstanding were $807.3 million and $1.57 billion, respectively. Since PPP loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA, there were no allowance for loan losses provided for these loans as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 . 

Third quarter 2021 net charge-offs were $13.5 million or annualized 0.13% of average loans-held-for-investment, compared with $24.2 million or annualized 0.26% of average loans held-for-investment for the same period of 2020. In the first nine months of 2021, net charge-offs were $40.2 million or annualized 0.14% of average loans held-for-investment, compared with $44.3 million or annualized 0.16% of average loans held-for-investment for the first nine months of 2020. The year-over-year decreases for both periods were primarily due to a decrease in C&#38;I charge-offs, partially offset by higher CRE charge-offs. The recognition of certain loan charge-offs could be delayed due to payment deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The following tables summarize activities in the allowance for loan losses for loans by portfolio segments for the third quarters and first nine months of 2021 and 2020:

Liquidity Risk Management 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is a financial institution&#8217;s capacity to meet its deposit and obligations to other counterparties as they come due, or to obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost to meet those obligations. The objective of liquidity management is to manage the potential mismatch of asset and liability cash flows. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institution&#8217;s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily operations or the financial condition of the institution. To achieve this objective, the Company analyzes its liquidity risk, maintains readily available liquid assets, and utilizes diverse funding sources including its stable core deposit base. 

The Board of Directors&#8217; Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility over liquidity risk management. At the management level, the Company&#8217;s Asset/Liability Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) establishes the liquidity guidelines that govern the day-to-day active management of the Company&#8217;s liquidity position by requiring sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are established and monitored for both the Bank and East West on a stand-alone basis to ensure that the Company can serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiaries. The ALCO regularly monitors the Company&#8217;s liquidity status and related management processes, providing regular reports to the Board of Directors. The Company believes its liquidity management practices have been effective under normal operating and stressed market conditions. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Sources. The Company&#8217;s primary source of funding is from deposits generated by its banking business, which are relatively stable and low-cost. Total deposits amounted to $53.36 billion as of September 30, 2021, compared with $44.86 billion as of December 31, 2020. The Company&#8217;s loan-to-deposit ratio was 76% as of September 30, 2021, compared with 86% as of December 31, 2020. 

In addition to deposits, the Company has access to various sources of wholesale funding, as well as borrowing capacity with the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (&#8220;FRBSF&#8221;) to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute its business strategy. Economic conditions and the stability of capital markets impact the Company&#8217;s access to and the cost of wholesale financing. The Company&#8217;s access to capital markets is also affected by the ratings received from various credit rating agencies. See Item 2 &#8212; MD&#38;A &#8212; Balance Sheet Analysis &#8212; Deposits and Other Sources of Funds in this Form 10-Q for further detail related to the Company&#8217;s funding sources. 

The Company maintains liquidity in the form of cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits with banks, short-term resale agreements and unencumbered high-quality and liquid AFS debt securities. The following table presents the Company&#8217;s liquid assets as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020: 

($ in thousands) September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Encumbered Unencumbered Total Encumbered Unencumbered Total Cash and cash equivalents $ &#8212; $ 4,852,901 $ 4,852,901 $ &#8212; $ 4,017,971 $ 4,017,971 Interest-bearing deposits with banks &#8212; 855,162 855,162 &#8212; 809,728 809,728 Short-term resale agreements &#8212; 1,961,142 1,961,142 &#8212; 900,000 900,000 U.S. Treasury, and U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise debt securities 378,213 1,926,620 2,304,833 91,637 773,443 865,080 U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities 481,425 3,584,106 4,065,531 494,132 2,320,532 2,814,664 Foreign government bonds &#8212; 254,848 254,848 &#8212; 182,531 182,531 Municipal securities &#8212; 501,489 501,489 1,033 395,040 396,073 Non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and CLOs 261 1,967,373 1,967,634 434 879,908 880,342 Corporate debt securities &#8212; 618,671 618,671 1,249 404,719 405,968 Total $ 859,899 &#160; $ 16,522,312 &#160; $ 17,382,211 &#160; $ 588,485 &#160; $ 10,683,872 &#160; $ 11,272,357 &#160; 

Unencumbered liquid assets totaled $16.52 billion as of September 30, 2021, compared with $10.68 billion as of December 31, 2020. AFS debt securities, included as part of liquidity sources, consist of high quality and liquid securities with moderate durations to minimize overall interest rate and liquidity risks. The Company believes these AFS debt securities provide quick sources of liquidity to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions, through sale or pledging. 

As a means to generate incremental liquidity, the Company maintains available borrowing capacity under secured borrowing lines with the FHLB and FRBSF, unsecured federal funds lines of credit with various correspondent banks, and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had available borrowing capacity of $22.40 billion, including $9.67 billion with the FHLB and $3.88 billion with the FRBSF. The Company believes that its liquidity sources are sufficient to meet all reasonably foreseeable short-term needs. Unencumbered loans and/or debt securities were pledged to the FHLB and the FRBSF discount window as collateral. The Company has established operational procedures to enable borrowing against these assets, including regular monitoring of the total pool of loans and debt securities eligible as collateral. Eligibility of collateral is defined in guidelines from the FHLB and FRBSF and is subject to change at their discretion. The Bank&#8217;s unsecured federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks, subject to availability, totaled $1.01 billion as of September 30, 2021. Estimated borrowing capacity from unpledged AFS debt securities totaled $7.84 billion as of September 30, 2021. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity for East West. In addition to bank level liquidity management, the Company manages liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock, principal and interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and additional investments in its subsidiaries. East West&#8217;s primary source of liquidity is from cash dividends distributed by its subsidiary, East West Bank. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends as discussed in Item 1 . Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. East West held $344.4 million and $439.1 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, management believes that East West has sufficient cash and cash equivalents to service its operating needs. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Stress Testing. Liquidity stress testing is performed at the Company level, as well as at the foreign subsidiary and foreign branch levels. Stress tests and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of a liquidity event on the financial and liquidity position of the entity. Scenario analyses include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, market triggers, and potential uses of funding and economic conditions in certain countries. In addition, Company specific events are incorporated into the stress testing. Liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons, both immediate and longer term, and over a variety of stressed conditions. Given the range of potential stresses, the Company maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities. 

As of September 30, 2021, the Company was not aware of any material commitments for capital expenditures in the foreseeable future and believes it has adequate liquidity resources to conduct operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of business. Given the uncertainty and the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company will continue to actively evaluate the nature and extent of the impact on its business and financial position. For more information of how the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our liquidity, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

Consolidated Cash Flows Analysis 

The following table presents a summary of the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the periods indicated. While this information may be helpful to highlight business strategies and certain macroeconomic trends, the cash flow analysis may not be as relevant when analyzing changes in the Company&#8217;s net earnings and assets. The Company believes that in addition to this traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to liquidity in Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity in this Form 10-Q may provide a useful context in evaluating the Company&#8217;s liquidity position and related activity. 

($ in thousands) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 745,831 $ 432,098 Net cash used in investing activities (7,817,886) (4,520,267) Net cash provided by financing activities 7,903,443 5,322,358 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 3,542 11,603 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 834,930 1,245,792 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 4,017,971 3,261,149 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 4,852,901 &#160; $ 4,506,941 &#160; 

Operating Activities &#8212; During the first nine months of 2021, net cash provided by operating activities mainly reflected inflow of $655.2 million from net income, plus net income adjusted for certain noncash items of $128.7 million, and a $30.2 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by a $78.6 million increase in accrued interest receivable and other assets. In comparison, during the same period in 2020, net cash provided by operating activities mainly reflected inflow of $403.7 million from net income, net income adjusted for certain noncash items of $273.2 million and a $220.3 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by a $467.1 million increase in accrued interest receivable and other assets. 

Investing Activities &#8212; During the first nine months of 2021, cash used in investing activities primarily reflected $4.30 billion of net AFS debt securities purchases (net of sales, maturities and redemptions), $2.13 billion in cash used for growth in the loan portfolio, and $1.14 billion in net resale agreements purchases (net of paydowns and maturities). During the same period in 2020, net cash used in investing activities primarily reflected cash outflows of $2.67 billion from loans held-for-investment, $1.14 billion of net AFS debt securities purchases (net of sales, maturities and redemptions), and $503.2 million in cash used for interest-bearing deposits with banks. 

Financing Activities &#8212; During the first nine months of 2021, net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected a net increase of $8.49 billion in deposits, partially offset by $405.0 million in repayment of FHLB advances, and $141.9 million in cash dividends paid. During the same period in 2020, net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected net increases of $4.34 billion in deposits and $1.43 billion in PPPLF advances, partially offset by $146.0 million in shares repurchased and $119.2 million in cash dividends paid. 

Market Risk Management 

Market risk is the risk that the Company&#8217;s financial condition may change resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, interest rate contracts, investment securities prices, credit spreads and related risk resulting from mismatches in rate sensitive assets and liabilities. In the event of market stress, the risk could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 

The Board&#8217;s Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility over market risk management. At the management level, the ALCO establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market risk management activities. Corporate Treasury supports the ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks. 

Interest Rate Risk Management 

Interest rate risk results primarily from the Company&#8217;s traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans, which are the primary areas of market risk for the Company. Economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates, and consumer preferences impact the level of noninterest-bearing funding sources at the Company, as well as affect the difference between the interest the Company earns on interest-earning assets and pays on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, changes in interest rates can influence the rate of principal prepayments on loans and the speed of deposit withdrawals. Due to the pricing term mismatches and the embedded options inherent in certain products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic value of these interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Other market risks include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk. These risks are not considered significant to the Company, and no separate quantitative information concerning these risks is presented herein. 

With oversight by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, the ALCO coordinates the overall management of the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk. The ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing the Company&#8217;s open market positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. Management of interest rate risk is carried out primarily through strategies involving the Company&#8217;s debt securities portfolio, loan portfolio, available funding channels and capital market activities. In addition, the Company&#8217;s policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk. 

The interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools, which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under multiple interest rate scenarios. The model incorporates the Company&#8217;s cash instruments, loans, debt securities, resale agreements, deposits, borrowings and repurchase agreements, as well as financial instruments from the Company&#8217;s foreign operations. The Company uses both a static balance sheet and a forward growth balance sheet to perform these analyses. The simulated interest rate scenarios include a non-parallel shift in the yield curve (&#8220;rate shock&#8221;) and a gradual non-parallel shift in the yield curve (&#8220;rate ramp&#8221;). In addition, the Company also performs simulations using alternative interest rate scenarios, including various permutations of the yield curve flattening, steepening or inverting. Results of these various simulations are used to formulate and gauge strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the Company&#8217;s capital and liquidity guidelines. 

The net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the Company&#8217;s interest-rate sensitive assets, liabilities and related derivative contracts. It also incorporates various assumptions, which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on results. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates, the yield curve evolution and shape, the correlation between various interest rate indices, financial instrument future repricing characteristics and spread relative to benchmark rates, and the effect of interest rate floors and caps. The modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit decay and deposit beta assumptions, which are derived from a regression analysis of the Company&#8217;s historical deposit data. Deposit beta commonly refers to the correlation of the changes in interest rates paid on deposits to changes in benchmark interest rates. The model is also sensitive to the loan and investment prepayment assumptions, based on an independent model and the Company&#8217;s historical prepayment data, which consider anticipated prepayments under different interest rate environments. 

Simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions. To the extent actual behavior is different from the assumptions in the models, there could be a material change in interest rate sensitivity. The assumptions applied in the model are documented and supported for reasonableness, and periodically back-tested to assess their effectiveness. The Company makes appropriate calibrations to the model as needed, continually refining the model, methodology and results. Changes to key model assumptions are reviewed by the ALCO. Scenario results do not reflect strategies that management could employ to limit the impact of changing interest rate expectations. 

Since the federal funds rate range was lowered to near zero in March 2020 and the Federal Reserve has committed its resources to support the U.S. economy, it is not expected that rates will decline further, nor is it expected that rates will enter into the negative territory. Consequently, the simulation results for the downward interest rate scenarios as of September 30, 2021 are not provided. 

Twelve-Month Net Interest Income Simulation 

Net interest income simulation modeling looks at interest rate risk through earnings. It projects the changes in interest rate sensitive asset and liability cash flows, expressed in terms of net interest income, over a specified time horizon for defined interest rates scenarios. Net interest income simulations generate insight into the impact of market rates changes on earnings and guide risk management decisions. The Company assesses interest rate risk by comparing net interest income using different interest rate scenarios. 

The federal funds target rate range was 0.25% as of both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. After lowering the range to between 0.00% and 0.25% in March 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee (&#8220;FOMC&#8221;) pledged to maintain monetary support for the economy. In the September 2021 meeting, the FOMC held the federal funds target rate at between 0.00% and 0.25%. The FOMC statement repeated language that inflation was transitory, but also acknowledged the inflation was elevated. In November 2021 meeting, the FOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds target rate at between 0.00% and 0.25% and to begin tapering its asset purchases in mid-November. The Bank anticipates the first rate hike will take place in 2022. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s net interest income sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates of 100 and 200 bps in upward direction as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Change in Interest Rates (in bps) Net Interest Income Volatility (1) 

September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 +200 16.3 % 12.6 % +100 7.8 % 5.6 % -100 NM NM -200 NM NM 

NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

(1) The percentage change represents net interest income over 12 months in a stable interest rate environment versus net interest income in the various rate scenarios. 

The Company&#8217;s net interest income profile as of September 30, 2021 reflects an asset sensitive position. Net interest income is expected to increase if interest rates rise and to decrease if interest rates decline. The potential impact of rate decreases is partially reduced due to the current low rate environment with the federal funds rate floored and the federal funds rate range between 0.00% and 0.25%. The Company is naturally asset sensitive due to the large share of variable rate loans in its loan portfolio, which are primarily linked to Prime and LIBOR indices. The Company&#8217;s interest income is vulnerable to changes in short-term interest rates. However, given the current low level of interest rates, the potential for further rate decreases is limited, which reduces the Bank&#8217;s exposure to risks associated with falling rates. The Company&#8217;s deposit portfolio is primarily comprised of non-maturity deposits, which are not directly tied to short-term interest rate indices, but are, nevertheless, sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. 

The Company&#8217;s estimated twelve-month net interest income sensitivity as of September 30, 2021 was slightly higher as compared with the sensitivity as of December 31, 2020 under both higher rate scenarios. This reflects both an increased rate sensitivity in the Company&#8217;s assets and an increase in noninterest bearing deposits. 

While an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates was used in the simulation model described in the preceding paragraphs, the Company believes that any shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore, have a more modest impact. The rate ramp table below shows the net income volatility under a gradual non-parallel shift of the yield curve upward direction, in even quarterly increments over the first 12 months, followed by rates held constant thereafter: 

Change in Interest Rates (in bps) Net Interest Income Volatility (1) 

September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 +200 Rate Ramp 7.1 % 4.9 % +100 Rate Ramp 3.0 % 2.2 % -100 Rate Ramp NM NM -200 Rate Ramp NM NM 

NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

(1) The percentage change represents net interest income under a gradual non-parallel shift in even quarterly increments over 12 months. 

The Company believes that the rate ramp table, shown above, when evaluated together with the results of the rate shock simulation, presents a more meaningful indication of the potential impact of rising interest rates to the Company&#8217;s twelve-month net interest income. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company&#8217;s modeled asset sensitivity increased under simulations for the up 200 and up 100 bps ramp scenarios. 

Economic Value of Equity at Risk 

Economic value of equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows. This calculation is used for asset/liability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank. The fair market values of a bank's assets and liabilities are directly linked to interest rates. The economic value approach provides a comparatively broader scope than the net income volatility approach since it captures all anticipated cash flows. 

EVE simulation reflects the effect of interest rate shifts on the value of the Company and is used to assess the degree of interest rate risk exposure. In contrast to the earnings perspective, the economic perspective identifies risks arising from repricing or maturity gaps over the life of the balance sheet. Changes in economic value indicate anticipated changes in the value of the Bank&#8217;s future cash flows. Thus, the economic perspective can provide a leading indicator of the Bank&#8217;s future earnings and capital values. The economic value method also reflects sensitivity across the full maturity spectrum of the Bank&#8217;s assets and liabilities. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s EVE sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates of 100 and 200 bps in an upward direction as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020: 

Change in Interest Rates (in bps) EVE Volatility (1) 

September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 +200 4.5 % 9.6 % +100 2.6 % 4.8 % -100 NM NM -200 NM NM 

NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

(1) The percentage change represents net portfolio value of the Company in a stable interest rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios. 

The Company&#8217;s EVE sensitivity for the upward interest rate scenarios decreased as of September 30, 2021, compared with the results as of December 31, 2020. The changes in EVE sensitivity during this period were primarily due to changes in the level and shape of the yield curve and changes in balance sheet mix. 

The Company&#8217;s EVE profile as of September 30, 2021 reflects an asset sensitive EVE position under the higher interest rate scenarios. Given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements, and the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary from those predicted by the Company&#8217;s model. 

Derivatives 

It is the Company&#8217;s policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. However, the Company will periodically enter into derivative transactions in order to reduce its exposure to market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Company believes that these derivative transactions, when properly structured and managed, may provide a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities and against risk in specific transactions. Hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps, forwards and options. Prior to entering into any hedging activities, the Company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies. In addition, the Company enters into derivative transactions in order to assist customers with their risk management objectives, such as managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices. To economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered into with the Company&#8217;s customers, the Company enters into mirrored derivative contracts with third-party financial institutions. The exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash and/or eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements entered between the Company and counterparty financial institutions. 

The Company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts. This counterparty credit risk is a multi-dimensional form of risk, affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty, both of which are sensitive to market-induced changes. The Company&#8217;s Credit Risk Management Committee provides oversight of credit risks and the Company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration, tenor limits and collateral. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties, by entering into legally enforceable master netting arrangements and by requiring collateral arrangements, where possible. The Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk-related to interest rate swaps to institutional third parties through the use of credit risk participation agreements. Certain derivative contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk. The Company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty&#8217;s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of its derivatives. 

The following table summarizes certain information about the derivative financial instruments utilized by the Company in its management of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020:

NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments &#8212; Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our asset and liability management activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the risk of variable cash flows that the Company is exposed to from its variable interest rate borrowings, including repurchase agreements and FHLB advances. The Company also uses derivatives to hedge the risk of changes in the USD equivalent value of a designated monetary amount of the Company&#8217;s net investment in East West Bank (China) Limited. For both cash flow and net investment hedges, the change in the fair value of the hedging instruments is recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax , on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

The fluctuation in foreign currency translation of the hedged exposure is expected to be offset by changes in the fair value of the forwards. As of September 30, 2021, the outstanding foreign currency forwards effectively hedged approximately 50% of the Chinese Renminbi exposure in East West Bank (China) Limited. 

Changes to the composition of the Company&#8217;s derivatives designated as hedging instruments reflect actions taken for interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions. 

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments &#8212; The Company enters into interest rate, foreign exchange and energy commodity contracts to support the business needs of its customers. When derivative transactions are executed with its customers, the derivative contracts are offset by paired trades with third-party financial institutions. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchange-traded, centrally cleared through a clearinghouse or over-the-counter. 

The Company offers various interest rate derivative contracts to its customers. For the interest rate contracts entered into with its customers, the Company managed its interest rate risk by entering into offsetting interest rate contracts with third-party financial institutions including with central clearing organizations. Certain derivative contracts entered with central clearing organizations are settled-to-market daily to the extent the central clearing organizations&#8217; rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement. Derivative contracts allow borrowers to lock in attractive intermediate and long-term fixed rate financing while not increasing the interest rate risk to the Company. These transactions are not linked to any specific Company assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, or to forecasted transactions in a hedging relationship, and are therefore classified as economic hedges. The contracts are marked-to-market at each reporting period. The changes in fair values of the derivative contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the derivative transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts, except for the credit valuation adjustment component. The Company records credit valuation adjustments on derivatives to properly reflect the variances of credit worthiness between the Company and the counterparties, considering the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements. 

The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts with its customers, consisting of forward, spot, swap and option contracts to accommodate the business needs of its customers. For the foreign exchange contracts entered into with its customers, the Company managed its foreign exchange and credit exposures by entering into offsetting foreign exchange contracts with third-party financial institutions and/or entering into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements with customer counterparties. The changes in the fair values entered with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the foreign exchange transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts. As of September 30, 2021, the Company anticipates performance by all counterparties and has not experienced nonperformance by any of its counterparties, and therefore did not incur any related losses. The Company also utilizes foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the economic effect of fluctuations in certain foreign currency on-balance sheet items, primarily foreign currency denominated deposits offered to its customers. The Company&#8217;s policies permit taking proprietary currency positions within approved limits, in compliance with exemptions to proprietary trading restrictions provided under Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Volcker Rule. The Company does not speculate in the foreign exchange markets, and actively manages its foreign exchange exposures within prescribed risk limits and defined controls. 

The Company enters into energy commodity contracts with its customers to allow them to hedge against the risk of fluctuation in energy commodity prices. To economically hedge against the risk of fluctuation in commodity prices in the products offered to its customers, the Company enters into offsetting commodity contracts with third-party financial institutions, including with central clearing organizations. Certain derivative contracts entered into with central clearing organizations are settled-to-market daily, to the extent the central clearing organizations&#8217; rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement. The changes in fair values of the energy commodity contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the energy commodity transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts. 

Additional information on the Company&#8217;s derivatives is presented in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K and Note 2 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Note 5 &#8212; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Impact of Inflation 

The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs and in the effect that inflation may have on both short- and long-term interest rates. Since almost all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than inflation. While inflation expectations do affect interest rates, interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or to the same extent, as the prices of goods and services.

The Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies ( Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K) are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Some accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments and may require significant judgments in applying complex accounting principles to individual transactions, where actual results could differ materially from the Company&#8217;s estimates. The Company has procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. In addition, certain accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements, and may apply to areas of relatively greater business importance. The following accounting policies are critical to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements: 

&#8226; fair value of financial instruments; 

&#8226; allowance for loan losses and unfunded credit commitments; 

&#8226; goodwill impairment; and 

&#8226; income taxes.

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement the Company&#8217;s unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with, or as an alternative to U.S. GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company&#8217;s performance that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure may also be a financial metric that is not required by U.S. GAAP or other applicable requirements. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance, and allow comparability to prior periods. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. 

The following tables present the reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the periods presented:

Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements that are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for such statements provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, the Company may make forward-looking statements in other documents that it files with, or furnishes to, the SEC and management may make forward-looking statements to analysts, investors, media members and others. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company&#8217;s industry, management&#8217;s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond the Company&#8217;s control, such as the future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. These statements relate to the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and/or business. They usually can be identified by the use of forward-looking language, such as &#8220;likely result in,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;forecasts,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;intends to,&#8221; &#8220;assumes,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;trend,&#8221; &#8220;objective,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; &#8220;continues,&#8221; &#8220;remains,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;can,&#8221; or similar expressions, and the negative thereof. You should not place undue reliance on these statements, as they are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in the documents incorporated by reference. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind these risks and uncertainties, as well as any cautionary statements the Company may make. Moreover, you should treat these statements as speaking only as of the date they are made and based only on information then actually known to the Company.
