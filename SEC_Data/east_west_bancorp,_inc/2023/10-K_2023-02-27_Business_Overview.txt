 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Organization 

East West is a bank holding company incorporated in Delaware on August 26, 1998, and is registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHC Act&#8221;). The Company commenced business on December 30, 1998 when, pursuant to a reorganization, it acquired all of the voting stock of East West Bank (&#8220;East West Bank&#8221; or the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), which became its principal asset. East West&#8217;s principal business is to serve as a holding company for the Bank and other banking or banking-related subsidiaries that East West may establish or acquire. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $64.11 billion in total assets, $47.63 billion in total net loans, $55.97 billion in total deposits, and $5.98 billion in total stockholders&#8217; equity. 

The Company operates in over 120 locations in the U.S. and Asia. In the U.S., the Bank&#8217;s corporate headquarters and main administrative offices are located in California; its U.S. branches and offices are located in California, Texas, New York, Washington, Georgia, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Nevada. In Asia, the Bank has four full-service branches in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Shantou and Shenzhen, and five representative offices in Beijing, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Xiamen and Singapore. 

Strategy 

We are committed to enhancing long-term stockholder value by growing loans, deposits and revenue, improving profitability, and investing for the future while managing risks, expenses and capital. Our business model is built on customer loyalty and engagement, understanding our customers&#8217; financial goals, and meeting our customers&#8217; financial needs through our diverse products and services. Our strategy focuses on seeking out and deepening client relationships that meet our risk/return parameters. This guides our decision-making across every aspect of our operations: the products we develop, the expertise we cultivate, and the infrastructure we build to help our customers conduct their businesses. We expect our relationship-focused business model to continue to generate organic growth from existing customers and to expand our targeted customer bases. We constantly invest in technology to improve the customer user experience, strengthen critical business infrastructure, and streamline core processes, while properly managing operating expenses. Our risk management activities are focused on ensuring that the Bank identifies and manages risks to sustain safety and soundness while maximizing profitability. 

East West has a commercial business operating license in China through its subsidiary, East West Bank (China) Limited, which makes it unique among U.S.-based regional banks. This license allows the Bank to open branches, make loans and collect deposits in the country. The Bank continues to develop its international banking presence with its network of overseas branches and representative offices. The latest expansion is the Singapore representative office, which opened in January 2023. In addition to facilitating traditional letters of credit and trade financing to businesses, these representative offices allow the Bank to assist existing clients and to develop new business relationships. Through its branches and offices, the Bank focuses on growing its cross-border client base between the U.S. and Asia, helping U.S.-based businesses expand in Asia, and helping companies based in Asia pursue business opportunities in the U.S. 

The Bank believes its customers benefit from the Bank&#8217;s understanding of the Asian market through its physical presence, corporate and organizational ties in Asia, as well as the Bank&#8217;s international banking products and services. The Bank believes this approach, combined with its senior management and Board of Directors&#8217; ties to Asian business opportunities and Asian American communities, provides the Bank with a competitive advantage. The Bank utilizes its presence overseas to identify and build corporate relationships, which the Bank may leverage to create business opportunities in California and other U.S. markets. 

Banking Services 

As of December 31, 2022, East West Bank was the largest independent commercial bank headquartered in Southern California based on total assets. The Bank is the largest independent bank in the U.S. focused on the financial service needs of individuals and businesses that operate both in the U.S. and Asia, and has a strong focus on the Asian American community. Through its network of over 120 banking locations in the U.S. and Asia, the Bank provides a wide range of personal and commercial banking services to businesses and individuals. The Bank provides services to its customers in English and in over 10 other languages. In addition to offering traditional deposit products that include personal and business checking and savings accounts, money market, and time deposits, the Bank also offers foreign exchange, treasury management and wealth management services. The Bank&#8217;s lending activities include commercial and residential real estate lending, construction finance, commercial business lending, working capital lines of credit, trade finance, letters of credit, affordable housing lending, asset-based lending, asset-backed finance, project finance, equipment financing and loan syndication. The Bank also provides financing services to clients in need of a financial bridge to facilitate their business transactions between the U.S. and Asia. Additionally, to support the business needs of its customers, the Bank offers hedging advisory and various derivative contracts such as interest rate, energy commodity and foreign exchange contracts. 

The integration of digital with brick and mortar channels has been an area of investment for the Bank, for both commercial and consumer banking. Our strategic priorities include the use of technology to innovate and expand commercial payments, treasury management products and services, and consumer banking. We have developed mobile and online banking platforms, which are continually enhanced to enrich our customer user experience, and which offer a full suite of banking services tailored to our customers&#8217; unique needs. In our view, the omnichannel banking service approach increases efficiency and deepens customer relationships. 

Operating Segments 

The Bank&#8217;s three operating segments, (1) Consumer and Business Banking, (2) Commercial Banking and (3) Other, are based on the Bank&#8217;s core strategy. The Consumer and Business Banking segment primarily provides financial products and services to consumer and commercial customers through the Company&#8217;s domestic branch network. The Commercial Banking segment primarily generates commercial loans and deposits. The remaining centralized functions, including the corporate treasury activities of the Company and eliminations of inter-segment amounts, are aggregated and included in the Other segment. For complete discussion and disclosure, see Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) &#8212; Results of Operation &#8212; Operating Segment Results and Note 17 &#8212; Business Segments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Competition 

The Bank operates in a highly competitive environment. The Company faces intense competition from domestic and foreign lending institutions, numerous other financial services providers and other entities, including as a result of emerging technologies. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service and convenience, quality and range of products and services offered, reputation, fees, interest rates on loans and deposits and lending limits. Competition also varies based on the types of customers and locations served. The Company is a leader of banking market share in the Asian American community; and maintains a differentiated presence within selected markets by providing cross-border commercial banking expertise to customers between the U.S. and Asia. 

While the Company believes it is well positioned within a highly competitive industry, the industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, economic, and technological changes, as well as continuing consolidation. 

Human Capital 

As a company that delivers relationship-driven financial solutions to a diverse customer base, we believe the strength of our workforce is one of the most significant contributors to our success. Our key human capital objectives are to attract, develop and retain quality talent who reflect our values and enable us to serve our customers. To achieve these objectives, our human resource programs have been designed based on our core values and the attributes we seek to foster, which include absolute integrity, customer orientation, creativity, respect, teamwork and selflessness. We use these core values to better service our customers and prepare our employees for leadership positions and to advance their careers. We are committed to promoting diversity in employment and advancement. 

As of December 31, 2022, we had 3,155 full-time equivalent employees, of which 230 were located in China and Hong Kong. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. The Company&#8217;s compensation and employee benefits expense was $477.6 million and $433.7 million, or 56% and 54% of total noninterest expense in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Diversity and Inclusion 

East West Bank was founded in 1973 in Chinatown, Los Angeles, California as a savings &#38; loan association for immigrants who were underserved by mainstream banks. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank was the largest FDIC-insured, minority-operated depository institution headquartered in the U.S., serving communities with diverse ethnicities and socio-economic backgrounds in eight states across the nation. Our operations are concentrated in areas that include larger numbers of immigrants and minorities. We proudly offer home loans and other products and services that support low-to-moderate income, minority and immigrant communities. We also provide community development loans, and partner with a diverse list of nonprofit and community-based organizations to promote wealth generation and entrepreneurship in underserved communities. Our focus on basic, fair-priced products and alternative credit criteria supports the under-banked, which is part of our founding mission. In addition, given our diverse customer base and the diversity of the communities that we serve, our retail bankers are able to assist customers in English and in over 10 other languages. 

Promoting diversity and inclusion in our workforce and executive leadership is critical to our continued growth and success, and is at the core of our history and guiding principles. Our commitment to this mission is reflected in the composition of our employees. In addition, we have adopted an Environmental and Social Policy Framework that governs our mission to support diversity, and formed two employee resource groups focused on cultural awareness and empowering women to pursue leadership development and opportunities. As of December 31, 2022, the composition of our workforce was as follows: 

##TABLE_START % of Total Workforce % of Total Managers 

Gender (1) :

(1) Presented as a percentage of the respective populations who self-identified. 

To put our diversity in context, minorities made up 46% of the workforce and 18% of the managers of FDIC-regulated institutions, according to the most recently available 2020 Diversity Self-Assessment from the FDIC&#8217;s Financial Institution Diversity Self-Assessment program. Our organizational commitment to diversity, under the leadership and oversight of our Board of Directors, is further reflected by the composition of our ten-member Board, which is presented in the following table as of December 31, 2022. This commitment to diversity was acknowledged in Bank Director&#8217;s 2022 &#8220;RankingBanking&#8221; study, in which we received the &#8220;Best Board&#8221; ranking due to our strong corporate governance practices, and the diversity and expertise of our directors.

Talent Acquisition, Development and Promotion 

An experienced and well qualified workforce is essential to delivering high quality and reliable banking services to our customers and to managing the Company in a safe and sound manner. We endeavor to attract, develop, and retain diverse, motivated talent as part of our ongoing commitment to building a stronger workforce to serve our customers and communities. 

The focus on leadership development and promoting from within is a critical part of our succession planning for key roles throughout the organization and fostering organizational stability. We recognize the importance of employee development and career growth in fostering retention of our employees, which is one of the Company's strategic objectives. In 2022, 20% of our employees advanced their careers within the Bank through over 600 internal promotions or new opportunities. We provide a variety of resources to help all employees grow in their current roles and build new skills for future advancement, including the encouragement of continuing education and providing benefits such as tuition reimbursement. 

Fair and Equitable Compensation 

Our compensation and benefits program provides both short- and long-term awards, incentivizing performance, and aligning employee and stockholder interests. Employee compensation packages include a competitive base salary and, subject to Company and individual performance, may include an annual cash and stock incentive bonus. We are committed to fair and equitable compensation programs, and regularly assess the current business environment and labor markets to review our compensation and benefits programs for pay equity. We sponsor a 401(k) plan for U.S. employees, provide a Company matching contribution, and maintain other defined contribution retirement plans. As of December 31, 2022, 94% of employees participated in our 401(k) plan. 

To foster a strong sense of ownership and to align the interests of our employees with our stockholders, restricted stock units are awarded to eligible employees under our stock incentive programs. W e also award stock grants under our &#8220;Spirit of Ownership&#8221; program to all of our employees, regardless of job title or part-time/full-time status. The program allows each employee to share directly in the success they help create. The fact that all our employees are also owners is a source of pride for us. In 2022, the Company granted over 500 thousand restricted stock units as part of its stock compensation programs. 

Wellness and Safety 

We are committed to supporting our employees&#8217; well-being by offering flexible and competitive benefits. Comprehensive health insurance coverage (medical, dental and vision) is offered to employees working at least 30 hours each week. We offer paid time off, life insurance, disability insurance, parental leave, wellness and benefits programs designed to assist employees in maintaining a healthy work-life balance. We also offer an Employee Assistance Program which aids benefits-eligible employees and their household members with personal and professional issues. We apply a consistent approach towards employee policies, opportunities, benefits, and protections to all employees regardless of their locations, except if there are contradictions between individual state laws. We took a wide variety of measures to protect the health and well-being of our employees and customers during the COVID-19 pandemic and are now supporting employees in returning to the office and/or shifting to new working arrangements. 

New Ways of Working 

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated our capabilities with respect to flexible work. We introduced a hybrid schedule and work-from-home arrangements to better support managers and employees as they adapt to new ways of working that embrace flexibility, promote inclusion and enhance productivity. 

Commitment to Community 

We are committed to making positive and lasting impacts in our communities through our business activities and our volunteer and charitable efforts. We aim to enhance the quality of life in our communities by engaging in meaningful and effective programs that help increase homeownership, preserve affordable housing, promote wealth building, enable more inclusive access to banking services and help alleviate homelessness. We are a vital part of the communities in which we live and work, and we encourage our employees to engage with our local communities by leading or participating in events to foster community development.

Supervision and Regulation 

Overview 

East West and the Bank are subject to extensive and comprehensive regulations under U.S. federal and state laws. Regulation and supervision by the federal and state banking agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) administered by the FDIC, consumers, and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of our investors. As a bank holding company, East West is subject to primary regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act. The Bank is regulated, supervised, and examined by the Federal Reserve, the DFPI, and, with respect to consumer laws, the CFPB. As the insurer of the Bank&#8217;s deposits, the FDIC has back-up examination authority of the Bank as well. In addition, the Bank is regulated by foreign regulatory agencies in international jurisdictions where we have a presence, including China, Hong Kong and Singapore. East West also has a wholly-owned nonbank subsidiary, East West Markets, LLC ("East West Markets"), which is an SEC-registered broker-dealer and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA"). East West Markets is subject to regulatory requirements from several regulatory bodies, including the SEC, FINRA, and state securities regulators. 

The Company is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, as amended, both as administered by the SEC. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol &#8220;EWBC&#8221; and subject to Nasdaq rules for listed companies. 

Described below are certain provisions of selected laws and regulations applicable to East West and the Bank. The descriptions are not intended to be complete, nor are they meant to fully address the statutes and regulations&#8217; effects and potential effects on East West and the Bank, and the descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations. A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policies may have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s business. 

East West 

As a bank holding company and pursuant to its election of financial holding company status, East West is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act. The BHC Act provides a federal framework for the regulation and supervision of bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. The BHC Act and other federal statutes grant the Federal Reserve authority to, among other things: 

&#8226; require periodic reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require in its discretion; 

&#8226; require bank holding companies to maintain certain levels of capital and, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), limit the ability of bank holding companies to pay dividends or bonuses unless their capital levels exceed the capital conservation buffer (see the section captioned &#8220;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#8221; included elsewhere under this item); 

&#8226; require bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to subsidiary banks and commit resources, as necessary, to support each subsidiary bank, including at times when bank holding companies may not be inclined to do so, and the failure to do so generally may be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and a violation of Federal Reserve regulations; 

&#8226; restrict dividends and other distributions from subsidiary banks to their parent bank holding companies; 

&#8226; require bank holding companies to terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain nonbank subsidiaries, affiliates or investments if the Federal Reserve believes that the activity, ownership, or control of the nonbank subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of the bank holding company, or if the activity, ownership, or control is inconsistent with the purposes of the BHC Act; 

&#8226; regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt, including by imposing interest ceilings and reserve requirements and requiring a bank holding company to obtain prior approval to purchase or redeem its securities in certain situations; 

&#8226; approve in advance senior executive officer or director changes and prohibit certain golden parachute payments to officers and employees, including change in control agreements and new employment agreements that are contingent upon termination; and 

&#8226; approve in advance the acquisitions of and mergers with bank holding companies, banks and other financial companies, and consider certain competitive, management, financial, financial stability and other factors in granting these approvals. DFPI approval may also be required for certain acquisitions and mergers involving a California state-chartered bank such as the Bank. 

East West&#8217;s election to be a financial holding company as permitted under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) generally allows East West to engage in any activity that the Federal Reserve has determined to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any such activity, without prior Federal Reserve approval. Activities that are considered financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance agency and underwriting, merchant banking activities and activities that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity. To maintain financial holding company status and continue to be able to engage in new activities or investments that are financial in nature, a financial holding company and all its depository institution subsidiaries must be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed,&#8221; and the financial holding company&#8217;s depository institution subsidiaries must have Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) ratings of at least &#8220;Satisfactory.&#8221; A depository institution subsidiary is considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it satisfies the requirements for this status discussed in the sections captioned &#8220; Regulatory Capital Requirements &#8221; and &#8220; Prompt Corrective Action ,&#8221; included elsewhere under this item. A depository institution subsidiary is considered &#8220;well managed&#8221; if it received a composite rating and a management rating of at least &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; in its most recent examination. See the section captioned &#8220; Community Reinvestment Act &#8221; included elsewhere under this item. 

The Bank and its Subsidiaries 

East West Bank is a California state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the FDIC. The Bank&#8217;s operations in the U.S. are primarily regulated and supervised by the Federal Reserve and the DFPI, and its activities outside the U.S. are regulated and supervised by its U.S. regulators and the applicable regulatory authority in the host country in which each overseas office is located. Specific federal and state laws and regulations that are applicable to banks monitor, among other things, their regulatory capital levels, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, and the nature and amount of collateral for certain loans. Bank regulatory agencies also have extensive discretion to impose various restrictions on management or operations and to issue policies and guidance in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies. California law permits state-chartered commercial banks to engage in any activity permissible for national banks, unless such activity is expressly prohibited by state law. The Bank may also form subsidiaries to engage in many activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries. Further, pursuant to the GLBA, the Bank may conduct certain &#8220;financial&#8221; activities in a subsidiary to the same extent permitted for a national bank, provided the Bank is &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed&#8221; and has a CRA rating of at least &#8220;Satisfactory.&#8221; 

Regulation of Foreign Subsidiaries and Branches 

The Bank&#8217;s foreign subsidiary, East West Bank (China) Limited, is subject to applicable foreign laws and regulations, such as those implemented by the CBIRC. East West Bank&#8217;s Hong Kong branch is subject to applicable foreign laws and regulations, such as those implemented by the HKMA and the HKSFC. The Singapore representative office, which opened in January 2023, is subject to applicable foreign laws and regulations, such as those implemented by the MAS. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

The federal banking agencies have imposed capital adequacy requirements, known as the Basel III Capital Rules, intended to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that is commensurate with the degree of risk associated with their operations. The Basel III Capital Rules define the components of regulatory capital, including Common Equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;), Tier 1 and 2 capital, and set forth minimum capital adequacy ratios of capital to risk-weighted assets and total assets. The Basel III Capital Rules also prescribe a standardized approach for risk-weighting assets and include a number of risk- weighting categories that affect the denominator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios. 

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, to be considered adequately capitalized, standardized approach banking organizations, such as the Company and the Bank are required to maintain minimum capital ratios of at least 4.5% CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets, 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, 8.0% total risk-based capital (i.e., Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets and a 4.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets. The Basel III Capital Rules also include a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; of 2.5% on top of each of the minimum risk-based capital ratios. Banking institutions with a risk-based capital ratio that meets or exceeds the minimum requirement but does not exceed the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonus payments based on the amount of the shortfall. As of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios exceeded the minimum capital adequacy requirements of the federal banking agencies, including the capital conservation buffer, and the Company and the Bank were classified as &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221; For additional discussion and disclosure see Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Regulatory Capital and Ratios and Note 16 &#8212; Regulatory Requirements and Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

The Bank is also subject to additional capital requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action (&#8220;PCA&#8221;) regulations that implement Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (&#8220;FDIA&#8221;), as discussed below under the Prompt Corrective Action section. 

Regulatory Capital-Related Developments 

From time to time, the regulatory agencies propose changes and amendments to, and issue interpretations of, risk-based capital requirements and related reporting instructions. Such proposals and interpretations could, if implemented in the future, affect our regulatory capital requirements and reported capital ratios. 

In March 2020, the United States federal banking agencies adopted a rule that allowed banking organizations to elect to delay the estimated effects of adopting the current expected credit loss accounting standard (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) on regulatory capital until January 2022, and subsequently to phase in the effects through January 2025 (i.e., a five-year transition, in total). The Company adopted the five-year transition in 2020. As a result, the effects of CECL on the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s regulatory capital were delayed through the year 2021, after which the effects are being phased-in over a three-year period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For additional discussion and disclosure on CECL, see Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Regulatory Capital and Ratios and Note 16 &#8212; Regulatory Requirements and Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Prompt Corrective Action 

The FDIA, as amended, requires federal banking agencies to take PCA with respect to insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA includes the following five capital tiers: &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; A depository institution&#8217;s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulations. The capital tiers in the PCA framework do not apply directly to bank holding companies (such as the Company). Under the federal banking agencies&#8217; regulations implementing the PCA provisions of the FDIA, an insured depository institution (such as the Bank) generally is classified in the following categories based on the capital measures indicated: 

##TABLE_START PCA Category Risk-Based Capital Ratios Total Capital Tier 1 Capital CET1 Capital Tier 1 Leverage 

Well capitalized (1) 

&#8805; 10% &#8805; 8% &#8805; 6.5% &#8805; 5% Adequately capitalized &#8805; 8% &#8805; 6% &#8805; 4.5% &#8805; 4% Undercapitalized &#60; 8% &#60; 6% &#60; 4.5% &#60; 4% Significantly undercapitalized &#60; 6% &#60; 4% &#60; 3.0% &#60; 3% Critically undercapitalized Tangible Equity/Total Assets &#8804; 2% ##TABLE_END

(1) Additionally, to be classified as well capitalized, an insured depository institution may not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or PCA directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 

An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios, if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank&#8217;s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying PCA regulations and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank&#8217;s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. 

The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of any dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company, if the depository institution would thereafter be &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; Undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is &#8220;significantly undercapitalized.&#8221; Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to several requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; requirements to reduce total assets, cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks and/or restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits. &#8220;Critically undercapitalized&#8221; institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. The FDIA also generally permits only &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; insured depository institutions to accept brokered deposits, although an &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; institution may apply to the FDIC for a waiver of this restriction. 

Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act and Stress Testing 

In May 2018, the enactment of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;EGRRCPA&#8221;) amended certain provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act and other statutes administered by the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies. The EGRRCPA lifted the asset size threshold for many of the Dodd-Frank Act enhanced prudential standards that had previously applied to banks and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets between $50 billion and $100 billion, except for the requirement to maintain a risk committee. The EGRRCPA also raised the asset size threshold for required company-run stress testing at banks and bank holding companies from $10 billion to $250 billion. Additionally, based on authority provided in the EGRRCPA, the Federal Reserve raised the asset size threshold for required supervisory stress testing at bank holding companies from $50 billion to $100 billion. Although the Company and the Bank are not required to conduct company-run or supervisory stress tests, we continue to conduct annual capital and quarterly liquidity stress tests.

The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has the authority to implement, examine and enforce compliance with federal consumer financial laws that apply to banking institutions with total consolidated assets exceeding $10 billion (such as the Bank) and their affiliates. The CFPB focuses its supervisory, examination, and enforcement efforts on, among other things: 

&#8226; risks to consumers and compliance with federal consumer financial laws when evaluating the policies and practices of a financial institution; 

&#8226; unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices; 

&#8226; rulemaking to implement various federal consumer statutes such as the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Electronic Fund Transfer Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Credit Billing Act, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act; and 

&#8226; the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets. 

The statutes and regulations that the CFPB enforces mandate certain disclosure and other requirements, and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with consumers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting payments on loans, and providing other services. The CFPB&#8217;s rulemaking, examination and enforcement authority has affected and will continue to impact financial institutions that provide consumer financial products and services, including the Company and the Bank. These regulatory activities may limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer. Failure to comply with federal and state laws prohibiting unfair, abusive, or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition, can subject the Bank to various penalties, including, but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines or criminal penalties, punitive damages, restitution to consumers, and the loss of certain contractual rights or business opportunities and may also result in significant reputational harm. 

Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Reserve Requirements 

The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) of San Francisco. As an FHLB member, the Bank is required to own a certain amount of capital stock in the FHLB. The Bank may also access the FHLB for both short-term and long-term secured credit. 

The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts either in the form of vault cash or an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve Bank, or a pass-through account as defined by the Federal Reserve. Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent, eliminating the reserve requirement for all depository institutions, an action that provides liquidity in the banking system to support lending to households and businesses. The Bank is a member bank and stockholder of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (&#8220;FRBSF&#8221;). 

Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds 

The principal source of liquidity of East West is dividends received from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends. In addition, the banking agencies may prohibit or limit the Bank from paying dividends, depending upon the Bank&#8217;s financial condition, if such payment is deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Furthermore, under the federal PCA regime, the Federal Reserve or FDIC may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company&#8217;s bank subsidiary is classified as &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; or, in some circumstances, &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; It is the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy that a bank holding company should generally pay dividends on common stock only if the company&#8217;s net income available to common stockholders over the past four quarters, net of distributions, would be sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the company&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy that a bank holding company should not maintain dividend levels that undermine the company&#8217;s ability to be a financial source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve requires bank holding companies to continuously review their dividend policy in light of their organizations&#8217; financial condition and compliance with regulatory capital requirements, and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels, unless both asset quality and capital are strong. 

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 

Pursuant to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as implemented by the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation W, banks are subject to restrictions that limit their ability to engage in transactions with their affiliates, including their parent bank holding companies. Regulation W limits the types, terms and amounts of these transactions and generally requires the transactions to be on an arm&#8217;s-length basis. In general, Regulation W requires that &#8220;covered transactions,&#8221; which include a bank&#8217;s extension of credit to or purchase of assets from an affiliate, be limited to 10% of the bank&#8217;s capital and surplus with respect to any one affiliate, and 20% of the bank&#8217;s capital and surplus with respect to the aggregate of all covered transactions with all affiliates. In addition, a bank generally may not extend credit to an affiliate unless the extension of credit is secured by specified amounts of collateral. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions, including by treating derivative transactions resulting in a bank&#8217;s credit exposure to an affiliate as covered transactions. In addition, the Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act establishes certain prohibitions, restrictions and requirements (known as &#8220;Super 23A&#8221; and &#8220;Super 23B&#8221;) on transactions between a covered fund and a banking entity that serves as an investment manager, investment adviser, organizer and offeror, or sponsor with respect to that covered fund, regardless of whether the banking entity has an ownership interest in the fund. 

Federal law also limits a bank&#8217;s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons (collectively, &#8220;insiders&#8221;). Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. The terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank&#8217;s capital. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

Under the CRA, an insured depository institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help serve the credit needs of its communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers and neighborhoods. The Federal Reserve periodically evaluates a state member bank&#8217;s performance under applicable performance criteria and assign a rating of &#8220;outstanding,&#8221; &#8220;satisfactory,&#8221; &#8220;needs to improve&#8221; or &#8220;substantial noncompliance.&#8221; The Federal Reserve takes this performance into account when reviewing applications by banks and their parent companies to expand branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, expand into new financial activities and merge with or acquire other financial institutions. Unsatisfactory CRA performance may result in the denial of such applications. Based on the most recent CRA examination as of March 8, 2021, the Bank was rated &#8220;outstanding&#8221;. On May 5, 2022, the federal banking agencies issued a joint Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that requested comment on substantial revisions to the methods used to evaluate an insured institution&#8217;s record of satisfying the credit needs of its entire communities, including low- and moderate-income individuals and neighborhoods, under the CRA. The changes that the agencies have proposed could make it more challenging and costly for the Bank and other insured depository institutions to receive an &#8220;outstanding&#8221; or &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating, but the impact on the Company will ultimately depend on whether and how such changes are implemented and applied. 

FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments 

The FDIC insures the Bank&#8217;s customer deposits through the DIF up to $250,000 for each depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, for each account ownership category. The DIF is funded mainly through quarterly insurance assessments on insured banks based on their assessment base. The Dodd-Frank Act revised the FDIC&#8217;s fund management authority by establishing a minimum Designated Reserve Ratio of 1.35 percent of total estimated insured deposits and redefining the assessment base to be calculated as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. The Bank&#8217;s DIF quarterly assessment is calculated by multiplying its assessment base by the applicable assessment rate. The assessment rate is calculated based on an institution&#8217;s risk profile, including capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk ratings, certain financial measures to assess an institution&#8217;s ability to withstand asset related stress and funding related stress, and a measure of loss severity that estimates the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of the Bank&#8217;s failure. 

Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, extraordinary growth in insured deposits caused the DIF reserve ratio to fall below the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent. This growth was primarily due to U.S. monetary policy action, direct government assistance to consumers and businesses, and an overall reduction in spending. The FDIC adopted a restoration plan in September 2020, which it amended in June 2022, to restore the DIF reserve ratio to at least 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028. 

In October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly for insured depository institutions by two basis points (&#8220;bps&#8221;), beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The new assessment rate schedules will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds two percent. As a result of the adoption of the assessment rate schedules, the FDIC insurance costs of the Bank will likely increase but not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

The FDIC may terminate a depository institution&#8217;s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution&#8217;s financial condition is unsafe or unsound, that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, or that the institution has violated any applicable rule, regulation, condition, or order imposed by the FDIC. 

Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering 

The Bank Secrecy Act (&#8220;BSA&#8221;), USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (&#8220;PATRIOT Act&#8221;), and other federal laws and regulations impose obligations on U.S. financial institutions to implement and maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls, which are reasonably designed to prevent, detect and report instances of money laundering, the financing of terrorism and to comply with recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Regulatory agencies require that the Bank have an effective governance structure for the program that includes effective oversight by our Board of Directors and management. We regularly evaluate and continue to enhance our systems and procedures to comply with the BSA, the PATRIOT Act and other anti-money laundering (&#8220;AML&#8221;) initiatives. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate BSA/AML programs, or to comply with all applicable laws or regulations, could have serious legal, compliance, financial and reputational consequences for the institution. 

The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (&#8220;AML Act&#8221;) was enacted in January 2021 and includes the most substantial changes to U.S. AML law since the PATRIOT Act. Among other changes, the AML Act imposes new beneficial ownership reporting requirements for certain entities doing business in the U.S.; requires the U.S. Treasury&#8217;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (&#8220;FinCEN&#8221;) to establish government-wide priorities for AML and countering the financing of terrorism; increases AML whistleblower awards and expands whistleblower protections; modernizes the statutory definition of &#8220;financial institution&#8221; to include &#8220;value that substitutes for currency&#8221;; enhances penalties for BSA and AML violations; streamlines and modernizes BSA and AML requirements; and improves coordination and cooperation among international, federal, state, and tribal AML law enforcement agencies. The Bank regularly evaluates and seeks to continue to enhance its systems and procedures as needed to ensure compliance with BSA/AML laws and regulations. 

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 

The U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. financial institutions do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various executive orders and Acts of Congress. Federal banking regulators also examine banks for compliance with regulations administered by the OFAC for economic sanctions against designated foreign countries, designated nationals, and others. OFAC publishes lists of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. Generally, if a bank identifies a transaction or account relating to a person or entity on an OFAC list, it must freeze the account or block the transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal, strategic, and reputational consequences, and result in civil monetary penalties on the Company and the Bank. 

Privacy and Cybersecurity 

Federal statutes and regulations require banking organizations to take certain actions to protect nonpublic consumer financial information. The Bank has a privacy policy that it must disclose to consumers annually. In some cases, the Bank must obtain a consumer&#8217;s consent before sharing information with an unaffiliated third party, and the Bank must allow a consumer to opt out of the Bank&#8217;s sharing of information with its affiliates for marketing and certain other purposes. These additional conditions affect the Bank&#8217;s information exchanges with credit reporting agencies. The Bank&#8217;s privacy practices and the effectiveness of its systems to protect consumer privacy are subjects covered in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s periodic compliance examinations. 

The Federal Reserve pays close attention to the cybersecurity practices of state member banks and their holding companies and affiliates. The interagency council of the federal banking agencies, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (&#8220;FFIEC&#8221;), has issued several policy statements and other guidance for banks in light of the growing risk posed by cybersecurity threats. The FFIEC has recently focused on such matters as compromised customer credentials, cyber resilience and business continuity planning. Examinations by the banking agencies now include review of an institution&#8217;s information technology and its ability to thwart or mitigate cyber-attacks. The federal banking agencies require banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator of significant computer security incidents within 36 hours of determining that such an incident has occurred. 

Consumer data privacy and data protection are also the subject of state laws. For example, the Bank is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;). This statute grants consumers several rights, including the right to request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request correction of information, the right to request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), and the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information. However, a consumer does not have these rights with respect to information that is collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the GLBA or the California Financial Information Privacy Act. The CCPA was amended in November 2020, when California voters passed Proposition 24, the California Privacy Rights Act (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;). The CPRA, which amends existing CCPA requirements effective January 1, 2023, with a one-year look back period, includes limitations on the sharing of personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising and the use of &#8220;sensitive&#8221; personal information, creates a new correction right, and establishes a new agency to enforce California privacy law. The California Attorney General has adopted regulations to implement the CCPA and has drafted regulations to implement the CPRA. 

There has also been significant development of new privacy laws and regulations in China. For example, the Standing Committee of China&#8217;s National People&#8217;s Congress passed the Personal Information Protection Law (&#8220;PIPL&#8221;), effective November 1, 2021. The PIPL establishes guiding principles on protection of a Chinese citizen&#8217;s personal information and applies to entities operating in China, foreign organizations, and individuals processing personal information outside China. Failure to comply with the PIPL requirements and other applicable international protection laws and regulations can result in monetary penalties, entities or individuals being placed on government&#8217;s banned list, or potential termination of future business activities in China, and potentially impact our Hong Kong and China operations. 

Climate-Related Risk Management 

In recent years, the federal banking agencies have increased their focus on climate-related risks affecting the operations of banks, the communities they serve and the broader financial system. The agencies have begun to enhance their supervisory expectations regarding banks&#8217; climate risk management practices, including by proposing guidance that would encourage banking organizations to, among other things: evaluate the potential impact of climate-related risks on the bank&#8217;s financial condition, operations and business objectives as part of its strategic planning process; account for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments; revise expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors; and prepare for the transition risks to the bank associated with the adjustment to a low-carbon economy and related changes in laws, regulations, governmental policies, technology, and consumer behavior and expectations. While the agencies&#8217; efforts to-date have focused on banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total assets, their supervisory expectations on climate risk management practices ultimately may apply to smaller banking organizations such as the Bank. 

In addition, states, such as California, are considering taking similar actions on climate-related financial risks. To the extent that federal and state regulators adopt climate-related supervisory expectations and requirements that apply to East West and the Bank, we may be required to incur compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs to conform to such expectations and requirements. 

Future Legislation, Regulation and Supervision Activities 

New statutes, regulations and policies that contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions and public companies operating in the U.S. are regularly adopted. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (&#8220;IRA&#8221;) enacted in August 2022, contains certain tax measures, including a corporate alternative minimum tax on large U.S. corporations, an excise tax on corporate stock buy-backs, and certain clean-energy tax provisions, which may apply to the Company. Changes to applicable statutes, regulations, and policies may change the Company&#8217;s operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways, increase the Company&#8217;s cost of conducting business, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, subject the Company to increased supervision activities and disclosure and reporting requirements, and restrict or expand the activities in which the Company may engage. Accordingly, such changes may have a significant influence on our operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans or future prospects, and the overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits. We cannot predict whether or in what form any statute, regulation or policy will be proposed or adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new statute, regulation or policy.
