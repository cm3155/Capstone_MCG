 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Management&#8217;s discussion and analysis (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) of earnings and related financial data are presented to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of First Citizens BancShares, Inc. and its subsidiaries (&#8220;BancShares&#8221;). This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes presented within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q along with our financial statements and related MD&#38;A of financial condition and results of operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (&#8220;2020 Annual Report&#8221;). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Although certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform to statement presentations for 2021, the reclassifications had no effect on shareholders&#8217; equity or net income as previously reported. Unless otherwise noted, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;BancShares&#8221; refer to the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations for BancShares. 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

BancShares conducts its banking operations through its wholly-owned subsidiary First-Citizens Bank &#38; Trust Company (&#8220;FCB&#8221;), a state-chartered bank organized under the laws of the state of North Carolina. 

BancShares&#8217; earnings and cash flows are primarily derived from our commercial and retail banking activities. We gather deposits from retail and commercial customers and also secure funding through various non-deposit sources. We invest the liquidity generated from these funding sources in interest-earning assets, including loans and leases, investment securities and overnight investments. We also invest in bank premises, hardware, software, furniture and equipment used to conduct our commercial and retail banking business. We provide treasury services products, cardholder and merchant services, wealth management services and various other products and services typically offered by commercial banks. The fees and service charges generated from these products and services are primary sources of noninterest income which is an essential component of our total revenue. 

We are focused on expanding our position in legacy and target markets through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. We believe our franchise is positioned for continued growth as a result of our client centric banking principles, disciplined lending standards, and our people. 

Refer to our 2020 Annual Report for further discussion of our strategy. 

RECENT ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS 

During the first quarter of 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) spread throughout the world, causing significant disruptions to the domestic and global economies. In response to the outbreak, governments imposed restrictions resulting in business shutdowns, regional quarantines, disruptions of supply chains, changes in consumer behavior and overall economic instability. In recent months, COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and are now generally available for use in the United States and certain other countries, however, we cannot predict how widely utilized they will be or whether they will be effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 (including its variants). 

Although we cannot predict when or if normal economic activity and business operations will resume, we did observe general declines in the level of economic uncertainty and stabilization of macroeconomic forecasts during the first half of 2021. In recent weeks, we have seen an uptick in the number of new cases, although the absolute level of these new cases is significantly below the levels witnessed at the height of the pandemic. We are unable to predict whether these trends will continue and how this will affect the overall economy at the current time. However, we remain vigilant in our review and monitoring efforts around the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic (including any of its variants) and its effects on the overall economy and our financial results. 

During the second quarter of 2021, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Federal Open Market Committee (&#8220;FOMC&#8221;) maintained the federal funds rate at a target range of 0.00% to 0.25%. The FOMC acknowledged the economy&#8217;s accelerating recovery from COVID-19, but maintained that the recovery is incomplete and economic risks remain. The FOMC expects to maintain this target range, but could see rate hikes in 2023 and possibly earlier. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;SBA-PPP&#8221;) was established through the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 to direct aid via loans to small businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

We completed the first round of SBA-PPP funding in the second half 2020. During the second quarter of 2021, we completed the second round of funding, which resulted in the origination of approximately 12,000 SBA-PPP loans totaling $1.2 billion. We recorded $27.2 million of interest and fee income related to SBA-PPP loans for the quarter. As of June 30, 2021, remaining net deferred fees on SBA-PPP loans were $54.9 million. 

With respect to the first round of SBA-PPP, we began accepting and processing applications for forgiveness during the third quarter of 2020. We have received approximately 20,000 forgiveness decisions from the SBA to date, representing over $2.6 billion in forgiveness payments. We originated approximately 23,000 loans during round one totaling $3.2 billion.

Through June 30, 2021, over 99% of all COVID-19-related loan extensions have begun repayment. Delinquency trends among loans entering repayment are in line with the remainder of the portfolio, and we have not seen significant declines in overall credit quality. 

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN 2021 

On October 15, 2020, BancShares and CIT Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220;CIT&#8221;), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) by and among BancShares, FCB, FC Merger Subsidiary IX, Inc., a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of FCB (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;), and CIT, the parent company of CIT Bank, N.A., a national banking association (&#8220;CIT Bank&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into CIT, with CIT as the surviving entity (the &#8220;First-Step Merger&#8221;), and as soon as reasonably practicable following the effective time of the First-Step Merger, CIT will merge with and into FCB, with FCB as the surviving entity (together with the First-Step Merger, the &#8220;Mergers&#8221;). The Merger Agreement further provides that immediately following the consummation of the Mergers, CIT Bank will merge with and into FCB, with FCB as the surviving bank (together with the Mergers, the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;). 

The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of each of BancShares and CIT. The Transaction has been approved by the shareholders of both companies and has received regulatory approval from the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). Completion of the proposed merger remains subject to approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and closing is expected in the third quarter, subject to such approval and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions. 

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the First-Step Merger (the &#8220;Effective Time&#8221;), each share of CIT common stock, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (&#8220;CIT Common Stock&#8221;), except for certain shares of CIT Common Stock owned by CIT or BancShares, will be converted into the right to receive 0.06200 shares of BancShares Class A common stock, par value $1.00 per share. Holders of CIT Common Stock will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares. 

In addition, at the Effective Time, each share of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01 per share, of CIT and 5.625% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, par value $0.01 per share, of CIT issued and outstanding will automatically be converted into the right to receive one share of a newly created series of preferred stock, Series B, of BancShares and one share of a newly created series of preferred stock, Series C, of BancShares, respectively. 

The Merger Agreement requires that, effective as of the Effective Time, the Boards of Directors of the combined company and the combined bank will consist of 14 directors, (i) 11 of whom will be members of the current Board of Directors of BancShares, and (ii) three of whom will be selected from among the current Board of Directors of CIT and will include as one of those three Ellen R. Alemany, Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of CIT. We intend to appoint Michael A. Carpenter and Vice Admiral John R. Ryan, USN (Ret.), as the two other members from CIT&#8217;s current Board of Directors who will join the Boards of Directors of the combined company and the combined bank. 

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY 

Second Quarter Highlights 

&#8226; Net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $152.8 million, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 0.6% compared to the same quarter in 2020. Net income available to common shareholders totaled $148.2 million for the second quarter of 2021. Net income per common share increased $0.35, or 2.4%, to $15.09 in the second quarter of 2021, from $14.74 per share during the comparable quarter in 2020. 

&#8226; Return on average assets for the second quarter of 2021 was 1.13%, down from 1.36% in the second quarter of 2020. Return on average equity for the second quarter of 2021 was 14.64%, down from 16.43% during the comparable quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Net interest income was $346.4 million for the second quarter of 2021, an increase of $9.0 million, or 2.7% compared to the same quarter in 2020. This was primarily due to lower rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, interest and fee income on SBA-PPP loans, and organic loan growth, partially offset by a decline in the yield on interest-earning assets. SBA-PPP loans contributed $27.2 million in interest and fee income for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $19.0 million in the same quarter of 2020. The taxable-equivalent net interest margin (&#8220;NIM&#8221;) was 2.68% for the second quarter of 2021, a decrease of 46 basis points from 3.14% for the second quarter in 2020. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $19.6 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $20.6 million in expense for the same quarter in 2020. The net charge-off ratio was 0.02% for the second quarter of 2021, down from 0.03% for the first quarter of 2021 and 0.09% for the second quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Noninterest income was $134.2 million for the second quarter of 2021, a decrease of $31.3 million, or 18.9%, compared to $165.4 million for the same quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense was $301.6 million for the second quarter of 2021, an increase of $9.9 million or by 3.4% compared to the same quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; The allowance for credit losses was $189.1 million at June 30, 2021, compared to $210.7 million at March 31, 2021. The $21.6 million change was due primarily to a reserve release for the three months ended June 30, 2021 driven by continued improvement in macroeconomic factors, strong credit performance, and low net charge-offs. 

&#8226; Total loans were $32.7 billion as of June 30, 2021, a decrease of $491.2 million, or by 5.9% on an annualized basis, since March 31, 2021. Excluding loans originated under the SBA-PPP, total loans increased $605.6 million, or by 8.0% on an annualized basis, since March 31, 2020. 

&#8226; Total deposits grew to $48.4 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or by 9.1% on an annualized basis, since March 31, 2021. 

&#8226; At June 30, 2021, BancShares remained &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; as defined by regulatory standards with a total risk-based capital ratio of 14.2%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital of 12.1%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.1% and a leverage ratio of 7.7%.

&#8226; The allowance for credit losses was $189.1 million at June 30, 2021, compared to $224.3 million at December 31, 2020. The $35.2 million change was due primarily to a reserve release for the six months ended June 30, 2021 driven by continued improvement in macroeconomic factors, strong credit performance, and low net charge-offs. 

&#8226; Total loans grew to $32.7 billion, a decrease of $102.3 million since December 31, 2020. Excluding SBA-PPP loans, total loans increased $604.7 million, or by 3.7% on an annualized basis, since December 31, 2020.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 

CIT Group Inc. 

On October 15, 2020, BancShares and CIT, entered into the Merger Agreement by and among BancShares, FCB, the Merger Sub, and CIT, the parent company of CIT Bank. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub and CIT will ultimately merge with and into FCB, with FCB as the surviving entity. The Merger Agreement further provides that immediately following the consummation of the Mergers, CIT Bank will merge with and into FCB, with FCB as the surviving bank. 

The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of each of BancShares and CIT. The transaction has been approved by the shareholders of both companies and has received regulatory approval from the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks and the FDIC. Completion of the proposed merger remains subject to approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and closing is expected in the third quarter, subject to such approval and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions. 

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Assisted Transactions 

BancShares completed fourteen FDIC-assisted transactions between 2009 and 2017. Nine of the fourteen FDIC-assisted transactions included shared-loss agreements which, for their terms, protected us from a substantial portion of the credit and asset quality risk we would otherwise incur. 

For certain FDIC-assisted transactions, the shared-loss agreement included a provision related to a payment owed to the FDIC at the termination of the agreement. As of June 30, 2021, these agreements have been satisfied following a $16.1 million payment made to the FDIC for the final active agreement during the first quarter of 2021.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Net Interest Income and Margin (Taxable-Equivalent Basis) 

Second Quarter 2021 compared to Second Quarter 2020 

Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $347.0 million for the second quarter of 2021, an increase of $9.1 million, or 2.7%, compared to the second quarter of 2020. This was primarily due to lower rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, an increase in interest and fee income on SBA-PPP loans, and organic loan growth, partially offset by a decline in the yield on interest-earning assets. SBA-PPP loans contributed $27.2 million in interest and fee income during the second quarter of 2021 compared to $19.0 million in the second quarter of 2020. 

The taxable-equivalent NIM was 2.68% in the second quarter of 2021, a decrease of 46 basis points from the comparable quarter in the prior year. The margin decline was primarily due to changes in earning asset mix as excess liquidity drove an increase in overnight investments as a percentage of total assets. This was coupled with a decline in the yield on interest-earning assets and partially offset by lower rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and the yield on SBA-PPP loans. 

Average interest-earning assets increased by $8.7 billion to $51.5 billion, compared to the second quarter of 2020. The primary drivers for this change were the excess liquidity build up which led to higher average overnight investments of $5.6 billion, a $1.5 billion increase in average loan balances due to SBA-PPP loans as well as organic loan growth and higher average investment securities of $1.6 billion. 

The yield on interest-earning assets decreased by 58 basis points to 2.80% when compared to the second quarter of 2020. The yield on loans and leases decreased to 3.89%, or by 21 basis points, as a result of downward rate resets on variable rate loans and lower rates on new fixed rate loans. The yield on overnight investments increased one basis point, but the large increase in average balances resulted in a change in earning asset mix, which contributed to an overall decline in the yield. The yield on investment securities decreased by 29 basis points primarily due to increased premium amortization on mortgage-backed securities as a result of higher than expected prepayments. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $4.5 billion to $28.9 billion, compared to the second quarter of 2020. This increase was driven by an increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances of $4.6 billion driven by strong deposit growth. This was partially offset by a decrease in average long-term borrowings of $48.2 million. 

Rates on interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 21 basis points to 0.21%, primarily due to decreased rates paid on interest-bearing deposits as a result of maturing time deposits and a reduction in rates paid on money market accounts. This is coupled with lower rates paid on borrowings. 

Six Months of 2021 compared to Six Months of 2020 

The taxable-equivalent net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was $687.3 million, an increase of $10.2 million, or 1.5%, compared to the same period in 2020. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to a decrease in total interest expense of $25.9 million, driven largely by declining rates on interest-bearing deposits. This was partially offset by a decrease in interest on investment securities of $10.0 million and a decrease of $4.3 million in interest earned on loans, driven by a decrease in yields, partially offset by the impact of SBA-PPP loans. 

The taxable-equivalent NIM was 2.74% for the six months ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of 59 basis points from the comparable period of 2020. Th e margin decline was primarily due to changes in earning asset mix and a decline in the yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and the impact of SBA-PPP loans on loan yields. 

Average year-to-date interest-earning assets for the six months ended June 30, 2021, increased by $9.7 billion to $50.1 billion, compared to the same period in 2020. This increase was driven by an increase in average overnight investments of $5.0 billion, coupled with a $2.8 billion increase in average loans outstanding and increases in average investment securities of $2.0 billion. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased by 76 basis points to 2.86% for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. The yield on loans and leases decreased by 36 basis points as a result of decreases in yields on commercial and residential loans. The yield on overnight investments and the investment securities portfolio decreased by 45 basis points and 55 basis points, respectively. The lower federal funds rate was the primary driver for the yield decrease on overnight investments, while the accelerated prepayments on mortgage-backed securities and reinvestment at lower yields were the primary drivers of the yield decline on investment securities. 

Average year-to-date interest-bearing liabilities for the six months ended June 30, 2021 increased by $4.6 billion to $28.4 billion, compared to the same period in 2020. This increase was primarily due to a $4.5 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances driven by deposit growth. The rate paid on interest-bearing deposits decreased by 26 basis points driven by decreased rates on time deposits and money market accounts. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 26 basis points to 0.22% for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 driven by maturing time deposits and declines in the rate paid on money market accounts. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $19.6 million for the second quarter of 2021, compared to $20.6 million in expense for the comparable quarter in 2020. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, provision for credit losses was a benefit of $30.6 million compared to $48.9 million in expense for the first six months of 2020. The change was driven primarily by reserve release attributable to improvements in macroeconomic factors during 2021, continued low net charge-offs and strong credit performance. Provision expense for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2020 included reserve builds related to COVID-19 of $14.6 million and $36.1 million, respectively.

Noninterest income is an essential component of our total revenue and is critical to our profitability level. The primary sources of noninterest income consist of wealth management services, fees and service charges generated from deposit accounts, cardholder and merchant services, and mortgage lending and servicing. 

Noninterest income for the second quarter of 2021 was $134.2 million, compared to $165.4 million for the same period of 2020, a decrease of $31.3 million, or 18.9%. The most significant components of the change were as follows: 

&#8226; A $52.9 million decline in the amount of favorable fair market value adjustments on marketable equity securities. Fair market value adjustments on marketable equity securities were heightened in the second quarter of 2020 as we built up our equity portfolio when the market contracted. As the market started to improve in the second quarter of 2020, we sold a large portion of it to realize the gains. The $64.6 million of gains recognized in the second quarter of 2020 consisted of realized gains of $37.0 million and unrealized gains of $27.6 million. 

&#8226; Mortgage income decreased by $3.9 million primarily due to a decline in gain on sale driven by interest rate movements. 

&#8226; Wealth management services increased by $9.4 million driven by increases in annuity fees, assets under management, and advisory and transaction fees. 

&#8226; Cardholder services income, net increased by $4.9 million, service charges on deposit accounts increased by $4.4 million and merchant services income increased by $3.2 million. These increases were driven by increased transaction activity. 

Noninterest income was $270.8 million for the first six months of 2021, compared to $229.4 million for the same period of 2020, an increase of $41.4 million, or 18.0%. The most significant components of the change were as follows: 

&#8226; Wealth management services increased by $15.2 million, due to increased annuity fees, assets under management, and advisory and transaction fees. 

&#8226; Gains on the market value of equity securities, net increased by $14.5 million. 

&#8226; Cardholder services income, net increased $6.7 million primarily due to an increase in transaction volume. 

&#8226; Mortgage income increased $3.9 million primarily due to a mortgage servicing rights impairment reversal in the first quarter of 2021. 

&#8226; Realized gains on investment securities available for sale, net decreased by $8.5 million primarily due to a higher volume of sales of debt securities in the first quarter of 2020.

The primary components of noninterest expense are salaries and related employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense. 

Noninterest expense was $301.6 million during the second quarter of 2021, an increase of $9.9 million, or 3.4%, compared to the same quarter in 2020. The most significant components of the change were as follows: 

&#8226; Personnel expense increased $11.9 million driven by an increase in payroll incentives and higher health insurance claims. 

&#8226; Processing fees paid to third parties increased $4.2 million as we continue to make investments in our digital and technological capabilities. 

&#8226; Collection and foreclosure-related expenses decreased $3.8 million and other noninterest expense decreased by $2.2 million. 

Noninterest expense was $597.5 million for the first six months of 2021, compared to $591.7 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $5.9 million, or 1.0%. The most significant components of the change were as follows: 

&#8226; Personnel expense increased by $11.7 million primarily due to an increase in payroll incentives coupled with the impact of merit increases. 

&#8226; Processing fees paid to third parties increased $7.5 million as we continue to make investments in our digital and technological capabilities. 

&#8226; Merger-related expenses increased $4.0 million in anticipation of the upcoming merger with CIT. 

&#8226; Other expenses decreased $11.3 million primarily due to a decrease in pension expense as a result of higher expected returns on plan assets coupled with improvements in the reserve for unfunded commitments. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense was $45.8 million and $36.8 million for the second quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 23.1% and 19.3% during the periods. 

Income tax expense totaled $89.8 million and $53.7 million for the first six months of 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 23.0% and 20.3% for the respective six month periods. 

The effective tax rates in 2020 were favorably impacted by the utilization of an allowable alternative for computing our federal income tax liability. The allowable alternative enabled us to use the federal income tax rate for certain deductible amounts related to prior year FDIC-assisted acquisitions that was applicable when these amounts were originally subjected to tax. Without this alternative, the effective tax rate for the second quarter and first six months of 2020 would have been approximately 23%. 

We monitor and evaluate the potential impact of current events on the estimates used to establish income tax expenses and income tax liabilities. On a periodic basis, we evaluate our income tax positions based on current tax law, positions taken by various tax auditors within the jurisdictions where BancShares is required to file income tax returns as well as potential or pending audits or assessments by tax auditors. 

INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS 

Interest-earning assets include overnight investments, investment securities and loans and leases, all of which reflect varying interest rates based on the risk level and repricing characteristics of the underlying asset. Riskier investments typically carry a higher interest rate but expose us to higher levels of market risk. We strive to maintain a high level of interest-earning assets relative to total assets, while keeping non-earning assets at a minimum. 

Interest-earning assets totaled $51.6 billion and $47.2 billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The $4.4 billion increase was primarily composed of a $3.5 billion increase in overnight investments and a $971.3 million increase in investment securities, partially offset by a $102.3 million decrease in loans. 

Investment Securities 

The primary objective of the investment portfolio is to generate incremental income by deploying excess funds into securities with minimal liquidity and credit risk, and low to moderate interest rate risk. Other objectives include acting as a stable source of liquidity, serving as a tool for asset and liability management and maintaining an interest rate risk profile compatible with BancShares&#8217; objectives. Additionally, purchases of equities and corporate bonds in other financial institutions have been made largely under a long-term earnings optimization strategy. Changes in the total balance of our investment portfolio result from trends in balance sheet funding and market performance. Generally, when inflows arising from deposit and treasury services products exceed loan and lease demand, we invest excess funds into the securities portfolio and into overnight investments. Conversely, when loan demand exceeds growth in deposits and short-term borrowings, we allow overnight investments to decline and use proceeds from maturing securities and prepayments to fund loan demand. See Note C - Investments for additional disclosures. 

The carrying value of investment securities totaled $10.9 billion at June 30, 2021, an increase of $971.3 million compared to December 31, 2020. The increase in the portfolio was primarily attributable to a strong liquidity position, resulting in investment securities purchases of $4.1 billion, partially offset by sales of $1.1 billion and maturities and paydowns of $2.0 billion. 

Available for sale securities are reported at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included as a component of AOCI, net of deferred taxes. As of June 30, 2021, investment securities available for sale had a net pre-tax unrealized gain of $45.3 million, compared to a net pre-tax unrealized gain of $102.3 million as of December 31, 2020. Management evaluated the available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position and concluded that the unrealized losses relate to changes in interest rates relative to when the securities were purchased, and therefore, no allowance for credit losses was recorded at June 30, 2021 or December 31, 2020. 

BancShares&#8217; portfolio of held to maturity debt securities consists of mortgage-backed securities issued by government agencies and government sponsored entities. Given the consistently strong credit rating of the U.S. Treasury and the long history of no credit losses on debt securities issued by government agencies and government sponsored entities, no allowance for credit losses was needed at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Loans and Leases 

Loans held for sale were $107.8 million at June 30, 2021, a net decrease of $17.1 million since December 31, 2020. 

At June 30, 2021, loans totaled $32.69 billion, a decrease of $102.3 million, or by 0.6% on an annualized basis since December 31, 2020. Excluding SBA-PPP loans, total loans increased $604.7 million, or by 3.7% on an annualized basis since December 31, 2020. 

BancShares reports non-PCD and PCD loan portfolios separately, and the non-PCD portfolio is further divided into commercial and consumer segments. Non-PCD loans and leases were $32.3 billion at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, representing 98.8% and 98.6% of total loans, respectively. PCD loans at June 30, 2021 were $396.5 million, compared to $462.9 million at December 31, 2020, representing 1.2% and 1.4% of total loans, respectively. 

The discount related to acquired non-PCD loans and leases was $14.5 million and $19.5 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The discount related to PCD loans was $35.8 million and $45.3 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

During the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, accretion income on purchased non-PCD loans and leases was $2.5 million while interest and accretion income on PCD loans was $12.8 million and $14.4 million, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, accretion income on purchased non-PCD loans and leases was $5.0 million while interest and accretion income on PCD loans was $23.7 million and $33.0 million, respectively

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

The allowance for credit losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) was $189.1 million at June 30, 2021, representing a decrease of $35.2 million since December 31, 2020. The ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases was 0.58% at June 30, 2021, compared to 0.68% at December 31, 2020. The ACL as a percentage of loans and leases excluding SBA-PPP loans, which have no recorded ACL, was 0.61% at June 30, 2021, compared to 0.74% at December 31, 2020. 

The ACL is calculated using a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, charge-off and recovery activity, loan growth, changes in macroeconomic factors, collateral type, estimated loan life and changes in credit quality. For the period ended June 30, 2021, the ACL change since December 31, 2020 was driven by improvement in macroeconomic factors, continued strong credit performance and low net charge-offs. Forecasted economic conditions are developed using third party macroeconomic scenarios adjusted based on management&#8217;s expectations over a forecast period of two years. For most pools, we use a 12-month straight-line reversion period to historical averages for model inputs; however for the consumer other, consumer card and commercial card pools, immediate reversion to historical net loss rates is utilized. Significant macroeconomic factors used in estimating the expected losses include unemployment, gross domestic product, home price index and commercial real estate index. Our ACL forecast considers a range of economic scenarios from an upside scenario to a severely adverse scenario, but the June 30, 2021 ACL forecast was calculated using the consensus baseline scenario. This scenario showed improvements in the most significant economic factors compared to what was used to generate the December 31, 2020 ACL. These loss estimates were also influenced by our strong credit quality and low net charge-offs. 

As of June 30, 2021, the consensus baseline forecast utilized the following significant inputs over the two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period: 

Unemployment - Rates are expected to improve with a peak of over 5% in the third quarter of 2021 declining to around 4% in early 2023. 

GDP Growth - Peak growth of approximately 7% in the third quarter of 2021, decreasing to around 2% in 2022 and thereafter. 

Home Pricing Index - Growth rates to fluctuate between 3.5% and 5% throughout the forecast period. 

Commercial Real Estate Index - Forecasted downturn with a maximum 8% drop by the end of 2021, and then improving towards positive year over year growth. 

At June 30, 2021, the ACL allocated to non-PCD loans and leases was $170.4 million, or 0.53% of non-PCD loans and leases, compared to $200.3 million, or 0.62%, at December 31, 2020. The decrease of 9 basis points since December 31, 2020 was primarily due to improvement in the macroeconomic factors, continued strong credit quality and low net charge-offs. The ACL as 

a percentage of non-PCD loans and leases excluding SBA-PPP loans was 0.56% at June 30, 2021 compared to 0.67% at December 31, 2020. 

At June 30, 2021, the ACL for PCD loans totaled $18.7 million compared to $24.0 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to paydowns and the decline in the portfolio coupled with the impact of improved macroeconomic factors. 

In the period ended June 30, 2021, the ACL on our commercial portfolio decreased $4.8 million, with the largest share of the decrease within commercial real estate. The ACL on the consumer portfolio decreased $25.2 million, with the largest decrease within residential mortgages. These portfolios were most impacted by the improvement in macroeconomic factors which was the primary driver of the decline. 

Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $2.0 million during the second quarter of 2021, compared to $7.4 million during the second quarter of 2020. On an annualized basis, total net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loans and leases was 0.02% and 0.09% for the second quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excluding the impact of SBA-PPP loans on average loan balances, net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loans and leases was 0.03% and 0.10% for the second quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $4.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to $14.9 million during the same period of 2020. On an annualized basis, total net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loans and leases was 0.03% and 0.10% for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Average SBA-PPP loans did not have an impact on net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loans for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS 

We selectively agree to modify existing loan terms to provide relief to customers who are experiencing financial difficulties or other circumstances that could affect their ability to meet debt obligations. Typical modifications include short-term deferral of interest or modification of payment terms. Troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) not accruing interest at the time of restructure are included as nonperforming loans. TDRs accruing at the time of restructure and continuing to perform based on the restructured terms are considered performing loans.

INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES 

Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securities sold under customer repurchase agreements, FHLB borrowings, subordinated debt, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing liabilities totaled $29.4 billion at June 30, 2021, compared to $27.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase was mostly due to an increase of $2.0 billion in interest-bearing deposits. 

Deposits 

Due to our focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position, core deposit retention remains a key business objective. We believe traditional bank deposit products remain an attractive option for many customers, as evidenced by the significant deposit growth the industry has experienced over the past 12 months. As economic conditions improve, we recognize that our liquidity position could be adversely affected as bank deposits are withdrawn. Our ability to fund future loan growth is significantly dependent on our success at retaining existing deposits and generating new deposits at a reasonable cost. 

At June 30, 2021, total deposits were $48.4 billion, an increase of $5.0 billion, representing annualized growth of 23.1% since December 31, 2020, driven by organic growth and the effects of government stimulus.

We are committed to effectively managing our capital to protect our depositors, creditors and shareholders. We continually monitor the capital levels and ratios for BancShares and FCB to ensure they exceed the minimum requirements imposed by regulatory authorities and to ensure they are appropriate given growth projections, risk profile and potential changes in the regulatory or external environment. Failure to meet certain capital requirements may result in actions by regulatory agencies that could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), the unrealized gains and losses on certain assets and liabilities, net of deferred taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders&#8217; equity. These amounts are excluded from shareholders&#8217; equity in the calculation of our capital ratios under current regulatory guidelines.

As of June 30, 2021, BancShares and FCB continued to exceed minimum capital standards and remained well-capitalized under Basel III guidelines. Trust preferred capital securities continue to be a component of total risk-based capital. 

BancShares and FCB had capital conservation buffers of 6.13% and 5.79%, respectively, at June 30, 2021, which exceeded the 2.50% requirement and, therefore, result in no limit on distributions. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Risk is inherent in any business. BancShares has defined a moderate risk appetite, a conservative approach to risk taking, with a philosophy that does not preclude higher risk business activities balanced with acceptable returns while meeting regulatory objectives. Through the comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework, senior management has primary responsibility for day-to-day management of the risks we face with accountability of and support from all associates. Senior management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which BancShares activities may be exposed, with effective challenge and oversight by management committees. In addition, the Board of Directors strives to ensure that the business culture is integrated with the enterprise risk management program and that policies, procedures and metrics for identifying, assessing, measuring, monitoring and managing risk are part of the decision-making process. The Board of Directors&#8217; role in risk oversight is an integral part of our overall Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework. The Board of Directors administers its risk oversight function primarily through the Board Risk Committee. 

The Board Risk Committee structure is designed to allow for information flow, effective challenge and timely escalation of risk-related issues. The Board Risk Committee is directed to monitor and advise the Board of Directors regarding risk exposures, including credit, market, capital, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic and reputational risks; review, approve, and monitor adherence to the risk appetite and supporting risk tolerance levels via a series of established metrics; and evaluate, monitor and oversee the adequacy and effectiveness of the Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework. The Board Risk Committee also reviews: reports of examination by and communications from regulatory agencies; the results of internal and third party testing and qualitative and quantitative assessments related to risk management; and any other matters within the scope of the Committee&#8217;s oversight responsibilities. The Board Risk Committee monitors management&#8217;s response to certain risk-related regulatory and audit issues. In addition, the Board Risk Committee may coordinate with the Audit Committee and the Compensation, Nominations and Governance Committee for the review of financial statements and related risks, information security and other areas of joint responsibility. 

In combination with other risk management and monitoring practices, enterprise-wide stress testing activities are part of the Risk Management Framework and conducted within a defined framework. Stress tests are performed for various risks to ensure the financial institution can support continued operations during stressed periods. 

Credit risk management 

Credit risk is the risk of not collecting payments pursuant to the contractual terms of loans, leases and certain investment securities. Loans and leases we originate are underwritten in accordance with our credit policies and procedures and are subject to periodic ongoing reviews. Acquired loans, regardless of whether PCD or non-PCD, are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date and are subject to periodic reviews to identify any further credit deterioration. Our independent credit review function conducts risk reviews and analyses of both originated and acquired loans to ensure compliance with credit policies and to monitor asset quality trends and borrower financial strength. These reviews include portfolio analysis by geographic location, industry, collateral type and product. We strive to identify potential problem loans as early as possible, to record charge-offs or write-downs as appropriate and to maintain an adequate ACL that accounts for expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. 

We continue to actively monitor our loan portfolio for areas of increased risk as a result of COVID-19 and to date have not seen any significant declines in credit quality. Through June 30, 2021, over 99% of all COVID-19 related loan extensions have begun repayment. 

Additionally, we participated in both rounds of funding in the SBA-PPP program, which provided much needed funds to our existing small business customers. We continue to assess both the credit and operational risks this program presents and at June 30, 2021, BancShares had $1.7 billion in SBA-PPP loans outstanding. 

Interest rate risk management 

Interest rate risk (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) results principally from: assets and liabilities maturing or repricing at different points in time, assets and liabilities repricing at the same point in time but in different amounts, and short-term and long-term interest rates changing in different magnitudes. 

We assess our short-term IRR by forecasting net interest income over 24 months under various interest rate scenarios and comparing those results to forecasted net interest income, assuming stable rates. IRR scenarios modeled include, but are not limited to, immediate, parallel rate shocks, interest rate ramps, changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in the relationships of our rates to market rates. Market interest rates have increased from year-end driven by improving economic conditions. Net interest income deterioration in down rate shocks will remain muted due to the low absolute value of market interest rates. Assumptions that incorporate customer migration from low rate deposit instruments to intermediate term fixed rate instruments as rates rise have been adjusted based on actual deposit behavior over the last three years during a rising rate cycle. 

Table 19 provides the impact on net interest income over 24 months resulting from various instantaneous interest rate shock scenarios as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Table 19 

NET INTEREST INCOME SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 

Estimated percentage (decrease) increase in net interest income Change in interest rate (basis points) June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 -100 (5.93) % (6.24) % +100 7.82 8.09 +200 14.48 14.57 

The decreased asset sensitivity in net interest income sensitivity metrics as of June 30, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 resulted from a deployment of excess liquidity out of low-yielding overnight cash predominantly into investment securities. 

Long-term interest rate risk exposure is measured using the economic value of equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long-term cash flows on earnings and capital. EVE represents the difference between the sum of the present value of all asset cash flows and the sum of the present value of the liability cash flows. EVE sensitivity analysis involves discounting cash flows of balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios. Cash flows will vary by interest rate scenario, resulting in variations in EVE. The base-case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longer-term repricing and option risk in the balance sheet. 

Table 20 presents the EVE profile as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Table 20 

ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY MODELING ANALYSIS 

Estimated percentage (decrease) increase in EVE Change in interest rate (basis points) June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 -100 (16.40) % (21.20) % +100 8.45 12.18 +200 9.02 15.71 

The economic value of equity metrics at June 30, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 were primarily affected by redeployment of excess funds during the second quarter of 2021 coupled with lower market interest rates. We do not typically utilize interest rate swaps, floors, collars or other derivative financial instruments to hedge our overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivity and risk. 

Liquidity risk management 

Liquidity risk is the risk that an institution will be unable to generate or obtain sufficient cash or its equivalents on a cost-effective basis to meet commitments as they fall due. The most common sources of liquidity risk arise from mismatches in the timing and value of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet cash inflows and outflows. In general, on-balance sheet mismatches generate liquidity risk when the effective maturity of assets exceeds the effective maturity of liabilities. A commonly cited example of a balance sheet liquidity mismatch is when long-term loans (assets) are funded with short-term borrowings (liabilities). Other forms of liquidity risk include market constraints on the ability to convert assets into cash at expected levels, an inability to access funding sources at sufficient levels at a reasonable cost, and changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit, market, operational, legal and reputation risks that can affect an institution&#8217;s liquidity risk profile. 

We utilize various limit-based measures to monitor, measure and control three different categories of liquidity risk: 

&#8226; Tactical - Measures the risk of a negative cash flow position whereby cash outflows exceed cash inflows over a short-term horizon out to nine weeks; 

&#8226; Structural - Measures the amount by which illiquid assets are supported by long-term funding; and 

&#8226; Contingent - Measures the risk of having insufficient liquidity sources to support cash needs under potential future stressed market conditions or having an inability to access wholesale funding sources in a timely and cost effective manner. 

We aim to maintain a diverse mix of liquidity sources to support the liquidity management function, while aiming to avoid funding concentrations by diversifying our external funding with respect to maturities, counterparties and nature. Our primary source of liquidity is our branch-generated retail deposit portfolio due to the generally stable balances and low cost. Additional sources include cash in excess of our reserve requirement at the Federal Reserve Bank, and various other corresponding bank accounts and unencumbered securities, which totaled $13.2 billion at June 30, 2021 compared to $9.6 billion at December 31, 2020. Another source of available funds was advances from the FHLB of Atlanta. Outstanding FHLB advances were $646.7 million as of June 30, 2021, and we had sufficient collateral pledged to secure $8.3 billion of additional borrowings from the FHLB of Atlanta. Also, at June 30, 2021, $4.4 billion in non-PCD loans with a lendable collateral value of $3.5 billion were used to create additional borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank. We also maintain Federal Funds lines and other credit lines, which had $606.0 million of available capacity at June 30, 2021. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, which we enter into in order to meet the financing needs of our customers. These off-balance sheet instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. For more information on these commitments, see Note N - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements.
