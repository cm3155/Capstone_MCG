 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Management&#8217;s discussion and analysis (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) of earnings and related financial data are presented to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of First Citizens BancShares, Inc. and its subsidiaries (&#8220;BancShares&#8221;). This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes presented within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q along with our financial statements and related MD&#38;A of financial condition and results of operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (&#8220;2020 Annual Report&#8221;). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Although certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform to statement presentations for 2021, the reclassifications had no effect on shareholders&#8217; equity or net income as previously reported. Unless otherwise noted, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;BancShares&#8221; refer to the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations for BancShares. 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

BancShares conducts its banking operations through its wholly-owned subsidiary First-Citizens Bank &#38; Trust Company (&#8220;FCB&#8221;), a state-chartered bank organized under the laws of the state of North Carolina. 

BancShares&#8217; earnings and cash flows are primarily derived from our commercial and retail banking activities. We gather deposits from retail and commercial customers and also secure funding through various non-deposit sources. We invest the liquidity generated from these funding sources in interest-earning assets, including loans and leases, investment securities and overnight investments. We also invest in bank premises, hardware, software, furniture and equipment used to conduct our commercial and retail banking business. We provide treasury services products, cardholder and merchant services, wealth management services and various other products and services typically offered by commercial banks. The fees and service charges generated from these products and services are primary sources of noninterest income which is an essential component of our total revenue. 

We are focused on expanding our position in legacy and target markets through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. We believe our franchise is positioned for continued growth as a result of our client centric banking principles, disciplined lending standards, and our people. 

Refer to our 2020 Annual Report for further discussion of our strategy. 

RECENT ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS 

During the first quarter of 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) spread throughout the world, causing significant disruptions to the domestic and global economies. In response to the outbreak, governments imposed restrictions resulting in business shutdowns, regional quarantines, disruptions of supply chains, changes in consumer behavior and overall economic instability. Although vaccines for COVID-19 have been made available to the general public in the United States and many places around the world, vaccination rates vary and effectiveness may decrease over time. We cannot predict how widely utilized the vaccines and boosters will be or whether and for how long they will be effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 (including its variants). 

Although we cannot predict when or if normal economic activity and business operations will resume, we observed general declines in the level of economic uncertainty and stabilization of macroeconomic forecasts during the first three quarters of 2021. The US experienced an uptick in the number of new cases during the third quarter of 2021. We are unable to predict whether these trends will continue and how this will affect the overall economy at the current time. However, we remain vigilant in our review and monitoring efforts around the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic (including any of its variants) and its effects on the overall economy and our financial results. 

During the third quarter of 2021, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Federal Open Market Committee (&#8220;FOMC&#8221;) maintained the federal funds rate at a target range of 0.00% to 0.25%. The FOMC acknowledged the economy&#8217;s accelerating recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, but maintained that the recovery is incomplete and economic risks remain. The FOMC expects to maintain this target range, but rate hikes are expected in late 2022 or early 2023. Further, the committee suggested that they will begin tapering asset purchases, potentially as early as the fourth quarter of 2021 if economic progress continues as expected. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;SBA-PPP&#8221;) was established through the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 to direct aid via loans to small businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

We completed the first round of SBA-PPP funding in the second half 2020 and the second round of funding during the second quarter of 2021. As of September 30, 2021, there were $1.1 billion SBA-PPP loans outstanding with remaining net deferred fees of $39.4 million. 

With respect to the first round of SBA-PPP, we began accepting and processing applications for forgiveness during the third quarter of 2020. As of September 30, 2021, we have received approximately 98% of forgiveness decisions from the SBA to date, representing over $3.1 billion in forgiveness payments. 

With respect to the second round of SBA-PPP, we began accepting and processing applications for forgiveness during the third quarter of 2021. As of September 30, 2021, we have received approximately 14% of forgiveness decisions from the SBA, representing over $175 million in forgiveness payments.

Through September 30, 2021, over 99% of all COVID-19-related loan extensions have begun repayment. Delinquency trends among loans entering repayment are in line with the remainder of the portfolio, and we have not seen significant declines in overall credit quality. 

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN 2021 

On October 15, 2020, BancShares and CIT Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220;CIT&#8221;), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) by and among BancShares, FCB, FC Merger Subsidiary IX, Inc., a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of FCB (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;), and CIT, the parent company of CIT Bank, N.A., a national banking association (&#8220;CIT Bank&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into CIT, with CIT as the surviving entity (the &#8220;First-Step Merger&#8221;), and as soon as reasonably practicable following the effective time of the First-Step Merger, CIT will merge with and into FCB, with FCB as the surviving entity (together with the First-Step Merger, the &#8220;Mergers&#8221;). The Merger Agreement further provides that immediately following the consummation of the Mergers, CIT Bank will merge with and into FCB, with FCB as the surviving bank (together with the Mergers, the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;). 

The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of each of BancShares and CIT. The Transaction has been approved by the shareholders of both companies and has received regulatory approval from the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). 

On September 30, 2021, the parties entered into an amendment to the merger agreement pursuant to which the parties mutually agreed to extend until March 1, 2022 the date after which either party may elect to terminate the merger agreement if the merger has not yet been completed. Completion of the proposed merger remains subject to approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and both parties are committed to continuing to seek such approval. The parties have responded to all questions issued by the Staff of the Federal Reserve Board, and the Staff has informed us that they do not have further questions at this time. The parties have been informed that the application is presently at the Governor level, but the Board of Governors has not provided a time frame for its decision on the application. Closing is expected to occur as soon as practicable following receipt of such approval and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions. 

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the First-Step Merger (the &#8220;Effective Time&#8221;), each share of CIT common stock, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (&#8220;CIT Common Stock&#8221;), except for certain shares of CIT Common Stock owned by CIT or BancShares, will be converted into the right to receive 0.06200 shares of BancShares Class A common stock, par value $1.00 per share. Holders of CIT Common Stock will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares. 

In addition, at the Effective Time, each share of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01 per share, of CIT and 5.625% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, par value $0.01 per share, of CIT issued and outstanding will automatically be converted into the right to receive one share of a newly created series of preferred stock, Series B, of BancShares and one share of a newly created series of preferred stock, Series C, of BancShares, respectively. 

The Merger Agreement requires that, effective as of the Effective Time, the Boards of Directors of the combined company and the combined bank will consist of 14 directors, (i) 11 of whom will be members of the current Board of Directors of BancShares, and (ii) three of whom will be selected from among the current Board of Directors of CIT and will include as one of those three Ellen R. Alemany, Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of CIT. We intend to appoint Michael A. Carpenter and Vice Admiral John R. Ryan, USN (Ret.), as the two other members from CIT&#8217;s current Board of Directors who will join the Boards of Directors of the combined company and the combined bank.

Completion of the proposed merger remains subject to approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and both parties are committed to continuing to seek such approval. The parties have responded to all questions issued by the Staff of the Federal Reserve Board, and the Staff has informed us that they do not have further questions at this time. The parties have been informed that the application is presently at the Governor level, but the Board of Governors has not provided a time frame for its decision on the application. Closing is expected to occur as soon as practicable following receipt of such approval and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions. 

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Assisted Transactions 

BancShares completed fourteen FDIC-assisted transactions between 2009 and 2017. Nine of the fourteen FDIC-assisted transactions included shared-loss agreements which, for their terms, protected us from a substantial portion of the credit and asset quality risk we would otherwise have incurred. 

For certain FDIC-assisted transactions, the shared-loss agreement included a provision related to a payment owed to the FDIC at the termination of the agreement. As of September 30, 2021, these agreements have been satisfied following a $16.1 million payment made to the FDIC for the final active agreement during the first quarter of 2021.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Net Interest Income and Margin (Taxable-Equivalent Basis) 

Third Quarter 2021 compared to Third Quarter 2020 

Taxable-equivalent net interest income totaled $347.5 million for the third quarter of 2021, a decrease of $6.8 million, or 1.9%, compared to the third quarter of 2020. The decline in net interest income was driven primarily by a decline in the yield on interest-earning assets due to the sustained low rate environment and a reduction in interest and fee income on SBA-PPP loans. These declines were partially offset by organic loan growth, higher average investment balances as we have deployed some of the excess liquidity on our balance sheet, and a decline in the rate paid on interest bearing deposits. SBA-PPP loans contributed $20.0 million in interest and fee income for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $28.9 million for the same quarter in 2020. While SBA-PPP loans continue to support overall net interest income, the contribution from these loans continues to decline as forgiveness activity continues. 

Net interest income increased $0.5 million compared to the linked quarter despite a decline in SBA-PPP income and continued low interest rates. Higher investment and overnight yields and balances, organic loan growth and slightly lower deposit costs more than offset rate pressure on loans and a decline in SBA-PPP income. SBA-PPP loans contributed $27.2 million in interest and fee income for the second quarter of 2021. 

The taxable-equivalent NIM was 2.61% in the third quarter of 2021, a decrease of 45 basis points from the comparable quarter of 2020. The margin decline was primarily due to changes in earning asset mix driven by excess liquidity and higher balances in overnight investments as well as declines in loan yields. These declines were partially offset by lower rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and increased yield on SBA-PPP loans. As with prior quarters, we continue to operate with liquidity above normal operating ranges which puts downward pressure on net interest margin. The level of organic loan growth has helped to somewhat protect taxable equivalent NIM from the impacts of the low interest rate environment. We have also opportunistically deployed incremental liquidity of $1 billion into the investment portfolio since the third quarter of 2020. 

The taxable-equivalent NIM declined 7 basis points from 2.68% for the linked quarter primarily due to changes in earning asset mix as our overnight investments continued to grow, partially offset by higher investment yields. 

Nine Months of 2021 compared to Nine Months of 2020 

The taxable-equivalent net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $1.0 billion, an increase of $3.4 million, or 0.3%, compared to the same period in 2020. This increase was primarily due to organic loan growth, an increase in interest and fee income on SBA-PPP loans, and lower rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. These increases were largely offset by a decline in the yield on interest-earning assets. SBA-PPP loans contributed $78.1 million in interest and fee income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $47.9 million for the same period in 2020. 

The taxable-equivalent NIM was 2.69% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, a decrease of 54 basis points from the comparable period of 2020. The margin decline was primarily due to changes in earning asset mix and a decline in the yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and increased income on SBA-PPP loans. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2021, compared to an expense of $4.0 million for the comparable quarter in 2020. The third quarter of 2021 was favorably impacted by a $5.9 million reserve release driven primarily by continued strong credit performance, low net charge-offs and improvement in macroeconomic factors. The comparable quarter in 2020 included a $1.5 million reserve build due to continued uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and net loan growth. Total net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2021 were $4.8 million, an increase from $2.6 million for the comparable quarter in 2020 due to a higher volume of charge-offs and lower recoveries. The net charge-off ratio was 0.06% for the third quarter of 2021 compared to 0.03% for the same quarter in 2020. The impact of SBA-PPP loans on average loan balances did not affect the net charge-off ratio in either three-month period. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, provision for credit losses was a benefit of $31.7 million compared to $52.9 million in expense for the first nine months of 2020. Provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was favorably impacted by a $41.1 million reserve release driven primarily by continued strong credit performance, low net charge-offs and improvement in macroeconomic factors. The comparable period in 2020 included $36.1 million reserve build related to uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 were $9.4 million, a decrease from $17.4 million for the comparable period in 2020 due to a lower volume of charge-offs and stable recoveries. The net charge-off ratio was 0.04% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to 0.07% for the same period in 2020. The impact of SBA-PPP loans on average loan balances did not have an impact on the net charge-off ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Excluding the impact of SBA-PPP loans on average loan balances, the net charge-off ratio was 0.08% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

Noninterest income is an essential component of our total revenue and is critical to our profitability level. The primary sources of noninterest income consist of wealth management services, fees and service charges generated from deposit accounts, cardholder and merchant services, and mortgage lending and servicing. 

Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2021 was $122.9 million, compared to $120.6 million for the same period of 2020, an increase of $2.4 million, or 2.0%. The most significant components of the change were as follows: 

&#8226; A $6.1 million favorable change in the fair market value adjustments on marketable equity securities. 

&#8226; Wealth management services increased by $5.6 million, primarily due to growth in assets under management driving higher advisory and transaction fees. 

&#8226; Service charges on deposit accounts increased by $4.0 million due to volume. 

&#8226; Cardholder services income, net increased by $3.1 million and merchant services, net increased by $1.6 million, primarily due to an increase in transaction volume. 

&#8226; Realized gains on investment securities available for sale, net declined by $13.3 million. 

&#8226; Mortgage income decreased by $7.0 million, driven by reductions in gain on sale margins and lower production volume in 2021 due to higher mortgage rates and increased competition. 

Noninterest income was $393.7 million for the first nine months of 2021, compared to $350.0 million for the same period of 2020, an increase of $43.8 million, or 12.5%. The most significant components of the change were as follows: 

&#8226; Wealth management services increased by $20.7 million, primarily due to growth in assets under management driving higher advisory and transaction fees. 

&#8226; A $20.6 million favorable change in the fair market value adjustments on marketable equity securities. 

&#8226; Cardholder services income, net increased by $9.8 million and merchant services, net increased by $7.8 million, primarily due to an increase in transaction volume. 

&#8226; Realized gains on investment securities available for sale declined by $21.9 million.

The primary components of noninterest expense are salaries and related employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense. 

Noninterest expense was $312.8 million during the third quarter of 2021, an increase of $21.2 million, or 7.3%, compared to the same quarter in 2020. The most significant components of the change were as follows: 

&#8226; Salaries and wages increased $13.7 million driven primarily by annual merit increases, increases in revenue-driven incentives, and an increase in temporary personnel costs. 

&#8226; Processing fees paid to third parties increased $3.7 million driven by our continued investments in digital and technology to support revenue-generating businesses and improve internal processes. 

&#8226; Merger-related expenses increased $3.5 million in anticipation of the upcoming merger with CIT. 

Noninterest expense was $910.3 million for the first nine months of 2021, compared to $883.3 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $27.0 million, or 3.1%. The most significant components of the change were as follows: 

&#8226; Salaries and wages increased $23.2 million driven primarily by annual merit increases, increases in revenue-driven incentives, and an increase in temporary personnel costs. 

&#8226; Processing fees paid to third parties increased $11.2 million by our continued investments in digital and technology to support revenue-generating businesses and improve internal processes. 

&#8226; Merger-related expenses increased $7.5 million in anticipation of the upcoming merger with CIT. 

&#8226; Other expenses decreased $16.5 million primarily due to a decrease in pension expense as a result of higher returns on plan assets, coupled with a reduction in the reserve for unfunded commitments. 

&#8226; Collection and foreclosure-related expenses declined $7.0 million. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense was $34.1 million and $35.8 million for the third quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 21.5% and 20.1% during the respective periods. 

Income tax expense totaled $123.9 million and $89.5 million for the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 22.6% and 20.2% for the respective nine month periods. 

The effective tax rates during 2020 were favorably impacted by BancShares&#8217; decision to utilize an allowable alternative for computing its federal income tax liability. The allowable alternative provided BancShares the ability to use the federal income tax rate for certain current year deductible amounts related to prior year FDIC-assisted acquisitions that was applicable when these amounts were originally subjected to tax. Without this alternative, the effective tax rate is materially unchanged for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 and the effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 would have been approximately 22.0% and 22.6% respectively. 

We monitor and evaluate the potential impact of current events on the estimates used to establish income tax expenses and income tax liabilities. On a periodic basis, we evaluate our income tax positions based on current tax law, positions taken by various tax auditors within the jurisdictions where BancShares is required to file income tax returns as well as potential or pending audits or assessments by tax auditors. 

INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS 

Interest-earning assets include overnight investments, investment securities and loans and leases, all of which reflect varying interest rates based on the risk level and repricing characteristics of the underlying asset. Riskier investments typically carry a higher interest rate but expose us to higher levels of market risk. We strive to maintain a high level of interest-earning assets relative to total assets, while keeping non-earning assets at a minimum. 

Interest-earning assets totaled $53.4 billion and $47.2 billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The $6.2 billion increase was primarily composed of a $5.5 billion increase in overnight investments and a $952.4 million increase in investment securities, partially offset by a $275.8 million decrease in loans. 

Investment Securities 

The primary objective of the investment portfolio is to generate incremental income by deploying excess funds into securities with minimal liquidity and credit risk, and low to moderate interest rate risk. Other objectives include acting as a stable source of liquidity, serving as a tool for asset and liability management and maintaining an interest rate risk profile compatible with BancShares&#8217; objectives. Additionally, purchases of equities and corporate bonds in other financial institutions have been made largely under a long-term earnings optimization strategy. Changes in the total balance of our investment portfolio result from trends in balance sheet funding and market performance. Generally, when inflows arising from deposit and treasury services products exceed loan and lease demand, we invest excess funds into the securities portfolio and into overnight investments. Conversely, when loan demand exceeds growth in deposits and short-term borrowings, we allow overnight investments to decline and use proceeds from maturing securities and prepayments to fund loan demand. See Note C - Investments to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures. 

The carrying value of investment securities totaled $10.9 billion at September 30, 2021, an increase of $952.4 million compared to December 31, 2020 attributable to our continued growth in deposits. During the period we had $5.0 billion in investment security purchases, partially offset by sales of $1.4 billion and maturities and paydowns of $2.6 billion. 

Available for sale securities are reported at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes. As of September 30, 2021, investment securities available for sale had a net pre-tax unrealized gain of $26.0 million, compared to a net pre-tax unrealized gain of $102.3 million as of December 31, 2020. Management evaluated the available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position and concluded that the unrealized losses relate to changes in interest rates relative to when the securities were purchased, and therefore, no allowance for credit losses was recorded at September 30, 2021 or December 31, 2020. 

BancShares&#8217; portfolio of held to maturity debt securities consists of mortgage-backed securities issued by government agencies and government sponsored entities. Given the consistently strong credit rating of the U.S. Treasury and the long history of no credit losses on debt securities issued by government agencies and government sponsored entities, no allowance for credit losses was needed at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Loans and Leases 

Loans held for sale were $98.5 million at September 30, 2021, a net decrease of $26.4 million since December 31, 2020. 

At September 30, 2021, loans totaled $32.5 billion, a decrease of $275.8 million, or by 1.1% on an annualized basis since December 31, 2020. Excluding SBA-PPP loans, total loans increased $1.0 billion, or by 4.6% on an annualized basis since December 31, 2020. 

BancShares reports non-PCD and PCD loan portfolios separately, and the non-PCD portfolio is further divided into commercial and consumer segments. Non-PCD loans and leases were $32.1 billion at September 30, 2021 and $32.3 billion at December 31, 2020, representing 98.9% and 98.6% of total loans, respectively. PCD loans at September 30, 2021 were $373.3 million, compared to $462.9 million at December 31, 2020, representing 1.1% and 1.4% of total loans, respectively. 

The discount related to acquired non-PCD loans and leases was $13.4 million and $19.5 million at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The discount related to PCD loans was $32.6 million and $45.3 million at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, accretion income on purchased non-PCD loans and leases was $1.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively, while interest and accretion income on PCD loans was $10.8 million and $15.0 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, accretion income on purchased non-PCD loans and leases was $6.1 million and $7.8 million, respectively, while interest and accretion income on PCD loans was $34.5 million and $48.0 million, respectively

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

The allowance for credit losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) was $183.2 million at September 30, 2021, representing a decrease of $41.1 million since December 31, 2020. The ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases was 0.56% at September 30, 2021, compared to 0.68% at December 31, 2020. The ACL as a percentage of loans and leases excluding SBA-PPP loans, which have no recorded ACL, was 0.58% at September 30, 2021, compared to 0.74% at December 31, 2020. 

The ACL is calculated using a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, charge-off and recovery activity, loan growth, changes in macroeconomic factors, collateral type, estimated loan life and changes in credit quality. For the period ended September 30, 2021, the ACL change since December 31, 2020 was driven by continued strong credit performance, low net charge-offs, and improvement in macroeconomic factors. Forecasted economic conditions are developed using third party macroeconomic scenarios adjusted based on management&#8217;s expectations over a forecast period of two years. For most pools, we use a 12-month straight-line reversion period to historical averages for model inputs; however for the consumer other, consumer card and commercial card pools, immediate reversion to historical net loss rates is utilized. Significant macroeconomic factors used in estimating the expected losses include unemployment, gross domestic product, home price index and commercial real estate index. Our ACL forecast considers a range of economic scenarios from an upside scenario to a severely adverse scenario, but the September 30, 2021 ACL forecast was calculated using the consensus baseline scenario. This scenario showed improvements in the most significant economic factors compared to what was used to generate the December 31, 2020 ACL. These loss estimates were also influenced by our strong credit quality and low net charge-offs. 

As of September 30, 2021, the consensus baseline forecast utilized the following significant inputs over the two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period: 

Unemployment - Rates are expected to improve to below 4% through the end of 2022 and stabilizing into early 2023. 

GDP Growth - Peak growth of just under 7% in the fourth quarter of 2021, decreasing to below 3% in 2022 and thereafter. 

Home Pricing Index - Growth rates of over 7% declining to below 4% over the forecast period. 

Commercial Real Estate Index - Small forecasted downturn through the first half of 2022 and then improving to over 6% into 2023. 

At September 30, 2021, the ACL allocated to non-PCD loans and leases was $164.8 million, or 0.51% of non-PCD loans and leases, compared to $200.3 million, or 0.62%, at December 31, 2020. The decrease of 11 basis points since December 31, 2020 was primarily due to continued strong credit performance, low net charge-offs, and improvement in macroeconomic factors. The ACL as a percentage of non-PCD loans and leases excluding SBA-PPP loans was 0.53% at September 30, 2021 compared to 0.67% at December 31, 2020. 

At September 30, 2021, the ACL for PCD loans totaled $18.4 million compared to $24.0 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to paydowns and the decline in the portfolio coupled with the impact of improved macroeconomic factors. 

In the period ended September 30, 2021, the ACL on our commercial portfolio decreased $8.2 million, with the largest share of the decrease within commercial real estate. The ACL on the consumer portfolio decreased $27.4 million, with decreases across all portfolios with the largest change in residential mortgages. These portfolios were largely impacted by the improvement in macroeconomic factors. 

Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $4.8 million during the third quarter of 2021, compared to $2.6 million during the third quarter of 2020. On an annualized basis, total net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loans and leases was 0.06% and 0.03% for the third quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. The impact of SBA-PPP loans on average loans balances did not affect the net charge-off ratio in either period. 

Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $9.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $17.4 million during the same period of 2020. On an annualized basis, total net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loans and leases was 0.04% and 0.07% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The impact of SBA-PPP loans on average loan balances did not have an impact on the net charge-off ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Excluding the impact of SBA-PPP loans on average loan balances, the net charge-off ratio was 0.08% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS 

We selectively agree to modify existing loan terms to provide relief to customers who are experiencing financial difficulties or other circumstances that could affect their ability to meet debt obligations. Typical modifications include short-term deferral of interest or modification of payment terms. Troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) not accruing interest at the time of restructure are included as nonperforming loans. TDRs accruing at the time of restructure and continuing to perform based on the restructured terms are considered performing loans.

INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES 

Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securities sold under customer repurchase agreements, FHLB borrowings, subordinated debt, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing liabilities totaled $30.4 billion at September 30, 2021, compared to $27.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase was mostly due to an increase of $3.1 billion in interest-bearing deposits. 

Deposits 

We strive to maintain a strong liquidity position, and therefore a focus on core deposit retention remains a key business objective. We believe traditional bank deposit products remain an attractive option for many customers, as evidenced by the significant deposit growth the industry has experienced over the past 18 months. As economic conditions improve, we recognize that our liquidity position could be adversely affected as bank deposits are withdrawn. Our ability to fund future loan growth is significantly dependent on our success at retaining existing deposits and generating new deposits at a reasonable cost. 

At September 30, 2021, total deposits were $50.1 billion, an increase of $6.6 billion, representing annualized growth of 20.4% since December 31, 2020, driven by organic growth.

We are committed to effectively managing our capital to protect our depositors, creditors and shareholders. We continually monitor the capital levels and ratios for BancShares and FCB to ensure they exceed the minimum requirements imposed by regulatory authorities and to ensure they are appropriate given growth projections, risk profile and potential changes in the regulatory or external environment. Failure to meet certain capital requirements may result in actions by regulatory agencies that could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), the unrealized gains and losses on certain assets and liabilities, net of deferred taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders&#8217; equity. These amounts are excluded from shareholders&#8217; equity in the calculation of our capital ratios under current regulatory guidelines.

As of September 30, 2021, BancShares and FCB continued to exceed minimum capital standards and remained well-capitalized under Basel III guidelines. Trust preferred capital securities continue to be a component of total risk-based capital. 

BancShares and FCB had capital conservation buffers of 6.30% and 5.93%, respectively, at September 30, 2021, and resulted in no limit on distributions. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Risk is inherent in any business. BancShares has defined a moderate risk appetite, a conservative approach to risk taking, with a philosophy that does not preclude higher risk business activities balanced with acceptable returns while meeting regulatory objectives. Through the comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework, senior management has primary responsibility for day-to-day management of the risks we face with accountability of and support from all associates. Senior management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which BancShares activities may be exposed, with effective challenge and oversight by management committees. In addition, the Board of Directors strives to ensure that the business culture is integrated with the enterprise risk management program and that policies, procedures and metrics for identifying, assessing, measuring, monitoring and managing risk are part of the decision-making process. The Board of Directors&#8217; role in risk oversight is an integral part of our overall Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework. The Board of Directors administers its risk oversight function primarily through the Board Risk Committee. 

The Board Risk Committee structure is designed to allow for information flow, effective challenge and timely escalation of risk-related issues. The Board Risk Committee is directed to monitor and advise the Board of Directors regarding risk exposures, including credit, market, capital, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic and reputational risks; review, approve, and monitor adherence to the risk appetite and supporting risk tolerance levels via a series of established metrics; and evaluate, monitor and oversee the adequacy and effectiveness of the Risk Management Framework and Risk Appetite Framework. The Board Risk Committee also reviews: reports of examination by and communications from regulatory agencies; the results of internal and third party testing and qualitative and quantitative assessments related to risk management; and any other matters within the scope of the Committee&#8217;s oversight responsibilities. The Board Risk Committee monitors management&#8217;s response to certain risk-related regulatory and audit issues. In addition, the Board Risk Committee may coordinate with the Audit Committee and the Compensation, Nominations and Governance Committee for the review of financial statements and related risks, information security and other areas of joint responsibility. 

In combination with other risk management and monitoring practices, enterprise-wide stress testing activities are part of the Risk Management Framework and conducted within a defined framework. Stress tests are performed for various risks to ensure the financial institution can support continued operations during stressed periods. 

Credit risk management 

Credit risk is the risk of not collecting payments pursuant to the contractual terms of loans, leases and certain investment securities. Loans and leases we originate are underwritten in accordance with our credit policies and procedures and are subject to periodic ongoing reviews. Acquired loans, regardless of whether PCD or non-PCD, are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date and are subject to periodic reviews to identify any further credit deterioration. Our independent credit review function conducts risk reviews and analyses of both originated and acquired loans to ensure compliance with credit policies and to monitor asset quality trends and borrower financial strength. These reviews include portfolio analysis by geographic location, industry, collateral type and product. We strive to identify potential problem loans as early as possible, to record charge-offs or write-downs as appropriate and to maintain an adequate ACL that accounts for expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. 

We continue to actively monitor our loan portfolio for areas of increased risk as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and to date have not seen any significant declines in credit quality. Through September 30, 2021, over 99% of all COVID-19 related loan extensions have begun repayment. 

Additionally, we participated in both rounds of funding in the SBA-PPP program, which provided much needed funds to our existing small business customers. At September 30, 2021, BancShares had $1.1 billion in SBA-PPP loans outstanding. 

Interest rate risk management 

Interest rate risk (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) results principally from: assets and liabilities maturing or repricing at different points in time, assets and liabilities repricing at the same point in time but in different amounts, and short-term and long-term interest rates changing in different magnitudes. 

We assess our short-term IRR by forecasting net interest income over 24 months under various interest rate scenarios and comparing those results to forecasted net interest income, assuming stable rates. IRR scenarios modeled include, but are not limited to, immediate, parallel rate shocks, interest rate ramps, changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in the relationships of our rates to market rates. Market interest rates have increased since year-end, driven by improving economic conditions. 

Table 19 provides the impact on net interest income over 24 months resulting from various instantaneous interest rate shock scenarios as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Table 19 

NET INTEREST INCOME SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 

Estimated percentage (decrease) increase in net interest income Change in interest rate (basis points) September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 -100 (6.94) % (6.24) % +100 7.42 8.09 +200 15.41 14.57 

Net interest income sensitivity metrics as of September 30, 2021 remain largely unchanged when compared to December 31, 2020. 

Long-term interest rate risk exposure is measured using the economic value of equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long-term cash flows on earnings and capital. EVE represents the difference between the sum of the present value of all asset cash flows and the sum of the present value of the liability cash flows. EVE sensitivity analysis involves discounting cash flows of balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios. Cash flows will vary by interest rate scenario, resulting in variations in EVE. The base-case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longer-term repricing and option risk in the balance sheet. 

Table 20 presents the EVE profile as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Table 20 

ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY MODELING ANALYSIS 

Estimated percentage (decrease) increase in EVE Change in interest rate (basis points) September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 -100 (15.09) % (21.20) % +100 8.32 12.18 +200 8.77 15.71 

The economic value of equity metrics at September 30, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 were primarily affected by ongoing growth in non-maturity deposits during 2021, coupled with higher market interest rates. We do not typically utilize interest rate swaps, floors, collars or other derivative financial instruments to hedge our overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivity and risk. 

LIBOR Transition 

In 2017, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;). Subsequent announcements have delayed the potential date for certain LIBOR tenors until June 30, 2023. 

We continue to transition away from LIBOR in order to cease issuance of loans indexed to LIBOR by December 31, 2021. Conforming and nonconforming adjustable rate mortgage originations transitioned to alternative rates in 2020. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) as the preferred alternative to LIBOR. We have introduced SOFR as an alternative rate for other business lines in mid-2021. We do not expect a material financial impact to BancShares or our customers from this transition. 

Liquidity risk management 

Liquidity risk is the risk that an institution will be unable to generate or obtain sufficient cash or its equivalents on a cost-effective basis to meet commitments as they fall due. The most common sources of liquidity risk arise from mismatches in the timing and value of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet cash inflows and outflows. In general, on-balance sheet mismatches generate liquidity risk when the effective maturity of assets exceeds the effective maturity of liabilities. A commonly cited example of a balance sheet liquidity mismatch is when long-term loans (assets) are funded with short-term borrowings (liabilities). Other forms of liquidity risk include market constraints on the ability to convert assets into cash at expected levels, an inability to access funding sources at sufficient levels at a reasonable cost, and changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit, market, operational, legal and reputation risks that can affect an institution&#8217;s liquidity risk profile. 

We utilize various limit-based measures to monitor, measure and control three different categories of liquidity risk: 

&#8226; Tactical - Measures the risk of a negative cash flow position whereby cash outflows exceed cash inflows over a short-term horizon out to nine weeks; 

&#8226; Structural - Measures the amount by which illiquid assets are supported by long-term funding; and 

&#8226; Contingent - Measures the risk of having insufficient liquidity sources to support cash needs under potential future stressed market conditions or having an inability to access wholesale funding sources in a timely and cost effective manner. 

We aim to maintain a diverse mix of liquidity sources to support the liquidity management function, while aiming to avoid funding concentrations by diversifying our external funding with respect to maturities, counterparties and nature. Our primary funding source is our branch-generated retail deposit portfolio due to the generally stable balances and low cost. Sources of liquidity include cash in excess of our reserve requirement at the Federal Reserve Bank, and various other corresponding bank accounts and unencumbered securities, which totaled $15.1 billion at September 30, 2021 compared to $9.6 billion at December 31, 2020. Another source of available funds is advances from the FHLB of Atlanta. Outstanding FHLB advances were $645.7 million as of September 30, 2021, and we had sufficient collateral pledged to secure $8.5 billion of additional borrowings from the FHLB of Atlanta. Also, at September 30, 2021, $4.6 billion in non-PCD loans with a lendable collateral value of $3.8 billion were used to create additional borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank. We also maintain Federal Funds lines and other credit lines, which had $556.0 million of available capacity at September 30, 2021. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, which we enter into in order to meet the financing needs of our customers. These off-balance sheet instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. For more information on these commitments, see Note N - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements.
