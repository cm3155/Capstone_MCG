 Item 1A. Risk Factors 

There have been no material changes in the risk factors during 2022 from those reported in our 2021 Annual Report, which had contemplated anticipated changes due to the CIT Merger. For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that management believes are material to an investment in us, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors , of our 2021 Annual Report, and Forward-Looking Statements of this Form 10-Q. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to management or that management does not currently deem material could also have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, the results of our operations or our business. If such risks and uncertainties were to materialize or the likelihoods of the risks were to increase, we could be adversely affected, and the market price of our securities could significantly decline.
