 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Market risk is the potential economic loss resulting from changes in market prices and interest rates. This risk can either result in diminished current fair values of financial instruments or reduced NII in future periods. Changes in fair value that result from movement in market rates cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Therefore, the impact that future changes in market rates will have on the fair values of financial instruments is uncertain. 

As of December 31, 2022, BancShares&#8217; market risk profile had changed since December 31, 2021, primarily due to the CIT Merger. 

Market risk information is set forth in Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations within the &#8220;Risk Management&#8221; section and in Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within Note 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, Note 14 &#8212; Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 16 &#8212; Fair Value.
