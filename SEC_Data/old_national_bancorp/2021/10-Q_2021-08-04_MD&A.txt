 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion is an analysis of our results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, and financial condition as of June 30, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

In this report, we have made various statements regarding current expectations or forecasts of future events, which speak only as of the date the statements are made. These statements are &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are also made from time-to-time in press releases and in oral statements made by the officers of Old National Bancorp (&#8220;Old National&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;). Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of the words &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; or the negative of those terms, and other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements also include, but are not limited to, statements regarding estimated cost savings, plans and objectives for future operations, the Company&#8217;s business and growth strategies, including future acquisitions of banks, regulatory developments, and expectations about performance as well as economic and market conditions and trends. 

Such forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and estimates, which although believed to be reasonable, may turn out to be incorrect. Therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon these estimates and statements. We cannot assure that any of these statements, estimates, or beliefs will be realized and actual results may differ from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. You are advised to consult further disclosures we may make on related subjects in our filings with the SEC. In addition to other factors discussed in this report, some of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include the following: 

&#8226; the possibility that the merger between Old National and First Midwest will not close when expected or at all because required regulatory, shareholder, or other approvals are not received or other conditions to the closing are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all, or are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated (and the risk that required regulatory approvals may result in the imposition of conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the proposed transaction); 

&#8226; the occurrence of any event, change, or other circumstances that could give rise to the right of one or both of the parties to terminate the definitive merger agreement between First Midwest and Old National; 

&#8226; the risk that any announcements relating to the merger could have adverse effects on the market price of the common stock of either or both parties to the transaction; 

&#8226; the possibility that the merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; 

&#8226; the length, severity, magnitude, and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the direct and indirect impact of such pandemic, including its impact on the Company&#8217;s financial conditions and business operations; 

&#8226; changes in the economy, which could materially impact credit quality trends and the ability to generate loans and gather deposits, including the pace of recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic; 

&#8226; market, economic, operational, liquidity, credit, and interest rate risks associated with our business; 

&#8226; competition; 

&#8226; government legislation and policies, including changes to address the impact of COVID-19 through the CARES Act and other legislative and regulatory responses to the COVID-19 pandemic; 

&#8226; our ability to execute our business plan, including the anticipated impact from the ONB Way strategic plan that may differ from current estimates; 

&#8226; unanticipated changes in our liquidity position, including but not limited to changes in our access to sources of liquidity and capital to address our liquidity needs; 

&#8226; our ability to successfully manage our credit risk and the sufficiency of our allowance for credit losses; 

&#8226; uncertainty about the discontinued use of LIBOR and the transition to an alternative rate; 

&#8226; failure or circumvention of our internal controls; 

&#8226; failure or disruption of our information systems; 

&#8226; significant changes in accounting, tax, or regulatory practices or requirements, including the impact of the CECL standard; 

&#8226; new legal obligations or liabilities or unfavorable resolutions of litigations; 

&#8226; disruptive technologies in payment systems and other services traditionally provided by banks; and 

&#8226; operational risks or risk management failures by us or critical third parties, including without limitation with respect to data processing, information systems, cyber-security, technological changes, vendor problems, business interruption, and fraud risks. 

Investors should consider these risks, uncertainties, and other factors in addition to risk factors included in this filing and our other filings with the SEC.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The non-GAAP financial measures presented below are used by our management and our Board of Directors on a regular basis in addition to our GAAP results to facilitate the assessment of our financial performance. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance an investor&#8217;s understanding of our financial results by providing a meaningful basis for period-to-period comparisons, assisting in operating results analysis, and predicting future performance. This information supplements our GAAP reported results, and should not be viewed in isolation from, or as a substitute for, our GAAP results. Accordingly, this financial information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, included elsewhere in this report, and included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items that are included in the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. 

The following table presents GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to similar measures that may be represented by other companies. 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Old National is devoted to the basic banking principles of organic loan growth, increases in non-interest income, prudent capital deployment, and expense management. We strive to continuously improve our operating leverage by growing our revenue faster than our expenses. In addition, we continue to actively seek new ways to serve our clients better by simplifying processes, offering superior products and services, and embracing new technologies. 

During the second quarter of 2021, Old National and First Midwest entered into a merger agreement. Both financial institutions are relationship-focused, with compatible cultures and a commitment to helping our clients achieve financial success. We believe this merger will create powerful synergies, additional market coverage, and create financial strength that will drive long-term shareholder value. 

During the second quarter of 2021, net income was $62.8 million, or $0.38 per diluted share. Net income was $51.7 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2020. 

During the second quarter of 2021, we recorded a provision for credit losses recapture of $4.9 million. This provision recapture was derived from the Moody&#8217;s baseline forecast, which included improved unemployment, gross domestic product, and house price index when compared to the forecast used in the prior quarter. 

Despite the challenging operating environment, we achieved strong fundamental results during the second quarter of 2021. 

Loans : Our loan balances, excluding loans held for sale, decreased $140.6 million to $13.785 billion at June 30, 2021 compared to $13.925 billion at March 31, 2021. This was primarily driven by a decline in PPP loans of $403.0 million, partially offset by growth in other commercial and commercial real estate loans. We reported strong total commercial loan production of $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2021 and the commercial loan pipeline totaled $2.6 billion at June 30, 2021. 

Net Interest Income : For the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020, our net interest income increased primarily due to higher average loans and investment securities, higher PPP related fees from forgiveness of loans, and lower costs of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by decreased loan and investment securities yields. Net interest income increased in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher average loans and investment securities, partially offset by decreased loan and investment securities yields. 

Noninterest Income : Noninterest income decreased $7.7 million to $108.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue, lower debt securities gains, and $1.5 million of swap termination fees. These decreases were partially offset by higher wealth management fees. The second quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2021 decreased $5.2 million primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue. 

Expenses : Noninterest expenses decreased $31.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to $36.1 million of charges related to the ONB Way in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The second quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2021 increased $11.9 million reflecting higher professional fees and salaries. 

Old National&#8217;s robust commercial pipeline at June 30, 2021, coupled with excess liquidity from deposit growth along with the momentum build from our ONB Way revenue initiatives bode well for future quarters. However, we are cautious that a peak in new cases of COVID-19 could stall the economy and cause a setback in the progress made during the first half of 2021. 

Pandemic Update 

As previously disclosed, the COVID-19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected our operations during 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021. Our historically careful underwriting practices, diverse and granular portfolios, and Midwest-based footprint has helped mitigate any adverse impact to Old National. In addition, the combination of the vaccine rollout, government stimulus payments, and reduced spending during the pandemic are likely contributing factors mitigating the impact of the pandemic on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations, and its customers as of June 30, 2021. However, there are some concerns that indicate a slower return to pre-pandemic routines. Examples of these concerns relate to more people than anticipated who refuse the vaccines and the emergence of resistant strains, which may cause 

businesses in some parts of the country to be much slower to reopen. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances surrounding the pandemic, it is difficult to predict the future adverse financial impact to Old National.

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the most significant component of our earnings, comprising 73% of revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Net interest income and margin are influenced by many factors, primarily the volume and mix of earning assets, funding sources, and interest rate fluctuations. Other factors include the level of accretion income on purchased loans, prepayment risk on mortgage and investment-related assets, and the composition and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We have observed signs of an economic recovery in the United States, with jobs, consumer spending, manufacturing, and other indicators rebounding from their weakest levels. However, there have been concerns about the emergence of communicable strains of the virus and whether enough people will agree to be vaccinated. Economic uncertainty remains and bouts of elevated volatility are expected to continue. 

Interest rates remained at near historic lows during the second quarter of 2021 after declining dramatically in the first half of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s Federal Funds range is currently in a target range of 0.00% to 0.25%, with the Effective Fed Funds Rate in the 0.05% to 0.10% range. If interest rates decline further, our interest rate spread could decline, which may result in a decrease in our net interest income. However, management has taken balance sheet restructuring, derivative, and deposit pricing actions to help mitigate this risk. 

Loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities. Funding from client deposits generally costs less than wholesale funding sources. Factors such as general economic activity, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and price volatility of competing alternative investments, can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize the mix of assets and funding, net interest income, and margin. 

Net interest income is the excess of interest received from interest-earning assets over interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. For analytical purposes, net interest income is presented in the table that follows, adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to reflect what our tax-exempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same after-tax yield as a taxable asset. We used the federal statutory tax rate in effect of 21% for all periods. This analysis portrays the income tax benefits related to tax-exempt assets and helps to facilitate a comparison between taxable and tax-exempt assets. Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Therefore, management believes these measures provide useful information for both management and investors by allowing them to make better peer comparisons. 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net interest income $ 149,927 &#160; $ 145,671 $ 298,047 &#160; $ 289,442 Conversion to fully taxable equivalent 3,470 &#160; 3,367 6,970 &#160; 6,690 Net interest income - taxable equivalent basis $ 153,397 &#160; $ 149,038 $ 305,017 &#160; $ 296,132 Average earning assets $ 21,095,280 &#160; $ 19,007,719 $ 20,849,829 &#160; $ 18,390,875 Net interest margin 2.84 &#160; % 3.07 % 2.86 &#160; % 3.15 % Net interest margin - taxable equivalent basis 2.91 &#160; % 3.14 % 2.93 &#160; % 3.22 % 

The increase in net interest income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to higher average earning assets, lower costs of average interest-bearing liabilities, and higher interest and fees related to PPP loans. Partially offsetting these increases were lower yields on average earning assets and lower accretion income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. Net interest income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 included accretion income (interest income in excess of contractual interest income) associated with acquired loans. Accretion income totaled $5.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2021 and $9.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to $5.8 million in the three months ended June 30, 2020 and $12.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020. We expect accretion income on loans to decrease over time, but this may be offset by future acquisitions. Net interest income included interest and net fees combined on PPP loans totaling $11.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and $24.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to $6.6 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020.

(1) The variance not solely due to rate or volume is allocated equally between the rate and volume variances. 

(2) Interest on investment securities and loans includes the effect of taxable equivalent adjustments of $2.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, during the three months ended June 30, 2021; and $4.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, during the six months ended June 30, 2021 using the federal statutory rate in effect of 21%. 

The decrease in the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to lower yields on interest earning assets and a change in the mix of average interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by higher average earning assets and lower costs of interest-bearing liabilities. The yield on interest earning assets decreased 37 basis points and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 18 basis points in the quarterly year-over-year comparison. The yield on interest earning assets is calculated by dividing annualized taxable equivalent net interest income by average interest earning assets while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities is calculated by dividing annualized interest expense by average interest-bearing liabilities. The yield on interest earning assets decreased 51 basis points and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 29 basis points in the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020. Accretion income represented 10 basis points of the net interest margin in both the three months ended June 30, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to 12 basis points for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 14 basis points for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The continued spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may offset the recent positive economic momentum and government stimulus programs, and could negatively impact net interest margin. Accordingly, there is still much uncertainty regarding the economic environment. 

Average earning assets were $21.095 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2021, compared to $19.008 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $2.087 billion, or 11%. Average earning assets were $20.850 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to $18.391 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $2.459 billion, or 13%. The increases in average earning assets were due to increases in average investment securities and average loans. The loan portfolio including loans held for sale, which generally has an average yield higher than the investment portfolio, was 67% of average interest earning assets for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to 70% for the six months ended June 30, 2020. 

Average loans including loans held for sale increased $545.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020 due to higher average commercial real estate loans, partially offset by lower average commercial loans, residential real estate loans, and consumer loans. Average loans including 

loans held for sale increased $1.093 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020 due to higher average commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by lower average residential real estate loans and consumer loans. The increase in average commercial loans for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020 reflected strong PPP loan production, which began in April 2020. Average commercial loans included PPP loans totaling $1.016 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and $1.012 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to $1.125 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and $562.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. 

Average investments increased $1.395 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and $1.137 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the same periods in 2020 reflecting excess liquidity. 

Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $1.269 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and $1.532 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the same periods in 2020. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $930.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and $1.077 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the same periods in 2020. This growth was primarily driven by the increased business and personal savings rates from various government stimulus actions. 

Average borrowed funds decreased $307.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and $323.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the same periods in 2020. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Old National recorded a provision for credit losses recapture of $4.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, compared to $22.5 million provision for credit losses expense for the three months ended June 30, 2020. Net recoveries on loans totaled $0.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2021, compared to net charge-offs of $0.5 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020. The provision for credit losses was a recapture of $22.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to expense of $39.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. Net recoveries on loans totaled $0.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to net charge-offs of $7.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The provision for credit losses recapture in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 reflected the improved economic forecast. PPP loans were factored in the provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021; however, due to the SBA guaranty and our borrowers&#8217; adherence to the PPP terms, the provision impact was insignificant. Continued loan growth in future periods, a decline in our current level of recoveries, or an increase in charge-offs could result in an increase in provision expense. Additionally, with the adoption of CECL beginning on January 1, 2020, provision expense may become more volatile due to changes in CECL model assumptions of credit quality, macroeconomic factors and conditions, and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses balance. 

Noninterest Income 

We generate revenues in the form of noninterest income through client fees, sales commissions, and other gains and losses from our core banking franchise and other related businesses, such as wealth management, investment consulting, and investment products. The following table details the components in noninterest income:

Noninterest income decreased $7.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue. 

Noninterest income decreased $7.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue, lower debt securities gains, and $1.5 million of swap termination fees in the six months ended June 30, 2021. These decreases were partially offset by higher wealth management fees. 

Wealth management fees increased $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and $2.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to higher personal and corporate trust fees and fiduciary account fees. 

Service charges and overdraft fees increased $0.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020 reflecting higher overdraft fees and service charges due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the three months ended June 30, 2020. 

Mortgage banking revenue decreased $9.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and $4.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the same periods in 2020 reflecting lower refinance transactions related to higher rates in 2021, which caused pipeline levels to drop and gain on sale margins to partially normalize. 

Investment product fees increased $1.2 million in for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the same periods in 2020 reflecting higher investment and advisor fees in 2021. 

Debt securities gains (losses), net had a favorable variance of $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to higher realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities in 2021. Debt securities gains (losses), net had an unfavorable variance of $3.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to lower realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities in 2021, partially offset by lower realized losses on sales of available-for-sale securities in 2021. 

Other income decreased $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to lower branded card incentives and unfavorable variances in net gains (losses) on sales of premises and other assets. Other income decreased $2.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to $1.5 million of swap termination fees in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and lower branded card incentives. 

Noninterest Expense 

The following table details the components in noninterest expense:

Noninterest expense increased $9.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020 reflecting higher salaries and employee benefits, higher professional fees associated with the anticipated First Midwest merger, higher data processing, and higher amortization of tax credit investments. These increases were partially offset by $4.9 million of charges related to the ONB Way strategic initiative in the three months ended June 30, 2020. 

Noninterest expense decreased $31.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020 reflecting $36.1 million of charges in the six months ended June 30, 2020 related to the ONB Way strategic initiative. 

Salaries and employee benefits increased $6.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to higher corporate incentives. Salaries and employee benefits decreased $5.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to personnel expenses related to the ONB Way totaling $7.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020. This decrease was partially offset by higher corporate incentives. 

Equipment expenses increased $0.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to higher accelerated depreciation and maintenance expenses of non-deployed assets related to the optimization of our branch network as part of the ONB Way strategic initiative. 

Marketing expenses decreased $0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to lower sales promotion expenses. 

Data processing expenses increased $2.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and $5.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the same periods in 2020 related to the modernization of our technology infrastructure. 

Professional fees increased $5.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and $3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the same periods in 2020 reflecting $6.2 million of professional fees incurred in the second quarter of 2021 related to the First Midwest merger, partially offset by consulting fees incurred in 2020 related to the ONB Way. 

FDIC assessment decreased $0.8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the same periods in 2020 due to decreased rates. 

Amortization of intangibles decreased $0.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and $1.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to lower amortization of core deposit intangibles. 

Amortization of tax credit investments increased $1.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020. Amortization of tax credit investments decreased $2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020. The recognition of tax credit amortization expense is contingent upon the successful completion of the rehabilitation of a historic building or completion of a solar project within the reporting period. Many factors including weather, labor availability, building regulations, inspections, and other unexpected construction delays related to a rehabilitation project can cause a project to exceed its estimated completion date. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our tax credit investments. 

Other expense decreased $5.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and $29.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to lease termination charges and impairments on long-lived assets related to branch consolidations that were part of the ONB Way strategic initiative totaling $3.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2020 and $24.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in other expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the same periods in 2020 also reflected favorable variances in provision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments totaling $2.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

We record a provision for income taxes currently payable and for income taxes payable or benefits to be received in the future, which arise due to timing differences in the recognition of certain items for financial statement and income tax purposes. The major difference between the effective tax rate applied to our financial statement income and the federal statutory tax rate is caused by a tax benefit from our tax credit investments and interest on tax-exempt securities and loans. The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of pre-tax income, was 18.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2021, compared to 15.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of pre-tax income, was 17.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to 14.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2020. In accordance with ASC 740-270, Accounting for Interim Reporting , the provision for income taxes was recorded at June 30, 2021 based on the current estimate of the 

effective annual rate. The higher effective tax rate during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the same periods in 2020 was primarily the result of increases in pre-tax book income. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Overview 

At June 30, 2021, our assets were $23.676 billion, a $715.0 million increase compared to assets of $22.961 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher investment securities. 

We have observed signs of an economic recovery in the United States, with jobs, consumer spending, manufacturing, and other indicators rebounding from their weakest levels. However, there have been concerns about the emergence of communicable strains of the virus and whether enough people will agree to be vaccinated. Economic uncertainty remains and bouts of elevated volatility are expected to continue. 

Earning Assets 

Our earning assets are comprised of investment securities, portfolio loans, loans held for sale, money market investments, interest earning accounts with the Federal Reserve, and equity securities. Earning assets were $21.085 billion at June 30, 2021, a $771.2 million increase compared to earning assets of $20.313 billion at December 31, 2020. 

Investment Securities 

We classify substantially all of our investment securities as available-for-sale to give management the flexibility to sell the securities prior to maturity if needed, based on fluctuating interest rates or changes in our funding requirements. 

Equity securities are recorded at fair value and totaled $2.5 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

At June 30, 2021, the investment securities portfolio, including equity securities, was $6.947 billion compared to $6.142 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $804.9 million. Investment securities represented 33% of earning assets at June 30, 2021, compared to 30% at December 31, 2020. Stronger commercial loan demand in the future could result in management&#8217;s decision to reduce the securities portfolio. At June 30, 2021, we had no intent to sell any securities that were in an unrealized loss position nor is it expected that we would be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery. 

The investment securities available-for-sale portfolio had net unrealized gains of $74.3 million at June 30, 2021, compared to net unrealized gains of $186.3 million at December 31, 2020. Net unrealized gains decreased from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021 reflecting lower net unrealized gains on mortgage-backed, U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, and tax exempt municipal securities due to an increase in long-term interest rates. 

The investment portfolio had an effective duration of 4.26 at June 30, 2021, compared to 4.08 at December 31, 2020. Effective duration measures the percentage change in value of the portfolio in response to a change in interest rates. Generally, there is more uncertainty in interest rates over a longer average maturity, resulting in a higher duration percentage. The annualized average yields on investment securities, on a taxable equivalent basis, were 2.10% for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2.16% for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to 2.63% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2.67% for the six months ended June 30, 2020. 

Loans Held for Sale 

Mortgage loans held for immediate sale in the secondary market were $50.1 million at June 30, 2021, compared to $63.3 million at December 31, 2020. Certain mortgage loans are committed for sale at or prior to origination at a contracted price to an outside investor. Other mortgage loans held for immediate sale are hedged with TBA forward agreements and committed for sale when they are ready for delivery and remain on the Company&#8217;s balance sheet for a short period of time (typically 30 to 60 days). These loans are sold without recourse, beyond customary representations and warranties, and Old National has not experienced material losses arising from these sales. Mortgage originations are subject to volatility due to interest rates and home sales, among other factors. 

We have elected the fair value option prospectively for residential loans held for sale. The aggregate fair value exceeded the unpaid principal balance by $1.9 million at June 30, 2021, compared to $3.5 million at December 31, 2020. 

Commercial and Commercial Real Estate Loans 

Commercial and commercial real estate loans are the largest classification within earning assets, representing 47% of earning assets at June 30, 2021, compared to 49% at December 31, 2020. At June 30, 2021, commercial and commercial real estate loans were $9.990 billion, an increase of $87.3 million compared to December 31, 2020 driven by strong production in the first half of 2021, partially offset by a decline in PPP loans. As of June 30, 2021, total PPP loans were $721.1 million, compared to $943.0 million at December 31, 2020. 

The following table provides detail on commercial loans by industry classification (as defined by the North American Industry Classification System) and by loan size.

(1) Other includes construction and land development properties, senior housing properties, religion properties, and mixed use properties. 

Residential Real Estate Loans 

At June 30, 2021, residential real estate loans held in our loan portfolio were $2.215 billion, a decrease of $33.4 million compared to December 31, 2020. Future increases in interest rates could result in a decline in the level of refinancings and new originations of residential real estate loans. 

Consumer Loans 

Consumer loans, including automobile loans and personal and home equity loans and lines of credit, decreased $55.8 million at June 30, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 due to decreases in consumer indirect loans, consumer direct loans, and home equity loans. 

Funding 

Total funding, comprised of deposits and wholesale borrowings, was $20.428 billion at June 30, 2021, an increase of $714.0 million from $19.714 billion at December 31, 2020. Included in total funding were deposits of $17.869 billion at June 30, 2021, an increase of $831.5 million from $17.037 billion at December 31, 2020. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $509.1 million from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Interest-bearing checking and NOW deposits decreased $55.6 million from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021, while savings deposits increased $280.0 million. Money market deposits increased $218.4 million from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Time deposits decreased $120.4 million from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021. 

We use wholesale funding to augment deposit funding and to help maintain our desired interest rate risk position. At June 30, 2021, wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and interbank borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances, and other borrowings, totaled $2.559 billion, a decrease of $117.4 million from December 31, 2020. Wholesale funding as a percentage of total funding was 13% at June 30, 2021 and 14% at December 31, 2020. The decrease in wholesale funding from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021 was primarily due to decreases in securities sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances, partially offset by an increase in other borrowings. 

Capital &#160; 

Shareholders&#8217; equity totaled $2.991 billion at June 30, 2021, compared to $2.973 billion at December 31, 2020. Old National paid cash dividends of $0.28 per share in the six months ended June 30, 2021, which reduced equity by $46.4 million. The change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investment securities decreased equity by $86.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2021. 

Capital Adequacy 

Old National and the banking industry are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. At June 30, 2021, Old National and its bank subsidiary exceeded the regulatory minimums and Old National Bank met the regulatory definition of &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; based on the most recent regulatory definition. 

Old National&#8217;s consolidated capital position remains strong as evidenced by the following comparisons of key industry ratios. 

Regulatory Guidelines Minimum June 30, December 31, 2021 2020 2020 Risk-based capital: Tier 1 capital to total average assets (leverage ratio) 4.00 % 8.38 &#160; % 8.12 % 8.20 % Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted total assets 7.00 11.95 &#160; 11.70 11.75 Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted total assets 8.50 11.95 &#160; 11.70 11.75 Total capital to risk-adjusted total assets 10.50 12.73 &#160; 12.68 12.69 Shareholders' equity to assets N/A 12.63 &#160; 12.96 12.95

In December 2018, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations&#8217; implementation of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. In March 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC published an interim final rule to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The interim final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). Old National is adopting the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period. 

Management views stress testing as an integral part of the Company&#8217;s risk management and strategic planning activities. The primary objective of the stress test is to ensure that Old National has a robust, forward-looking stress testing process and maintains sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. Management also uses the stress testing framework to evaluate decisions relating to pricing, loan concentrations, capital deployment, and mergers and acquisitions to ensure that strategic decisions align with Old National&#8217;s risk appetite statement. Old National&#8217;s stress testing process incorporates key risks that include strategic, market, liquidity, credit, operational, regulatory, compliance, legal, and reputational risks. Old National&#8217;s stress testing policy outlines steps that will be taken if stress test results do not meet internal thresholds under severely adverse economic scenarios. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Overview 

Old National has adopted a Risk Appetite Statement to enable the Board of Directors, Executive Leadership Group, and Senior Management to better assess, understand, and mitigate the risks of Old National. The Risk Appetite Statement addresses the following major risks: strategic, market, liquidity, credit, operational/technology/cyber, regulatory/compliance/legal, reputational, and human resources. Our Chief Risk Officer is independent of 

management and reports directly to the Chair of the Board&#8217;s Enterprise Risk Management Committee. The following discussion addresses these major risks: credit, market, liquidity, operational/technology/cyber, and regulatory/compliance/legal. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are committed and focused on the health and safety of our team members, clients, and communities. We will continue to evaluate and adjust our banking center hours and lobby usage as necessary depending on the path of the virus across our footprint. Our banking centers are still open for business and we continue to lend to qualified businesses for working capital and general business purposes, while our online banking network is continuously available for digital banking transactions. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk represents the risk of loss arising from an obligor&#8217;s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Our primary credit risks result from our investment and lending activities. 

Investment Activities 

We carry a higher exposure to loss in our pooled trust preferred securities, which are collateralized debt obligations, due to illiquidity in that market and the performance of the underlying collateral. At June 30, 2021, we had pooled trust preferred securities with a fair value of $9.4 million, or less than 1% of the available-for-sale securities portfolio. These securities remained classified as available-for-sale and at June 30, 2021, the unrealized loss on our pooled trust preferred securities was $4.4 million. The fair value of these securities is expected to improve as we get closer to maturity, but may be adversely impacted by credit deterioration. 

All of our mortgage-backed securities are backed by U.S. government-sponsored or federal agencies. Municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and other debt securities are evaluated by reviewing the credit-worthiness of the issuer and general market conditions. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details about our investment security portfolio. 

Counterparty Exposure 

Counterparty exposure is the risk that the other party in a financial transaction will not fulfill its obligation. We define counterparty exposure as nonperformance risk in transactions involving federal funds sold and purchased, repurchase agreements, correspondent bank relationships, and derivative contracts with companies in the financial services industry. Old National manages exposure to counterparty risk in connection with its derivatives transactions by generally engaging in transactions with counterparties having ratings of at least &#8220;A&#8221; by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Rating Service or &#8220;A2&#8221; by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. Total credit exposure is monitored by counterparty and managed within limits that management believes to be prudent. Old National&#8217;s net counterparty exposure was an asset of $227.6 million at June 30, 2021. 

Lending Activities 

Commercial 

Commercial and industrial loans are made primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital, and other general business purposes. Lease financing consists of direct financing leases and is used by commercial customers to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment. The credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant. A determination is made as to the applicant&#8217;s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved. In addition to an evaluation of the applicant&#8217;s financial condition, a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment, such as additional collateral or personal guarantees, to be relied upon in the transaction. Credit agency reports of the applicant&#8217;s credit history supplement the analysis of the applicant&#8217;s creditworthiness. 

Commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors, developers, and builders primarily domiciled in the geographic market areas we serve: Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. These loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate at LTV margins deemed appropriate for the property type, quality, location, and sponsorship. Generally, these LTV ratios do not exceed 80%. The commercial properties are predominantly non-residential properties such as retail centers, industrial properties and, to a lesser extent, more specialized properties. Substantially all of our commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area. 

In the underwriting of our commercial real estate loans, we obtain appraisals for the underlying properties. Decisions to lend are based on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan, we primarily emphasize the ratio of the property&#8217;s projected net cash flows to the loan&#8217;s debt service requirement. The debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than 120% and it is computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate. In addition, a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is often required from the principal(s) of the borrower. In most cases, we require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien, fire and extended coverage casualty insurance, and flood insurance, if appropriate, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property. In addition, business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required. 

Construction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income, business income from an owner-occupant, or the sale of the property to an end-user. We may mitigate the risks associated with these types of loans by requiring fixed-price construction contracts, performance and payment bonding, controlled disbursements, and pre-sale contracts or pre-lease agreements. 

Consumer 

We offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets, with residential home mortgages comprising our largest consumer loan category. These loans are secured by a primary residence and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks of the consumer. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, DTI ratios, liquidity, and credit scores. A maximum LTV ratio of 80% is generally required, although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance or other mitigating factors. We offer fixed rate mortgages and variable rate mortgages with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first, third, fifth, or seventh year, depending on the product and are based on indexed rates such as prime. We do not offer payment-option facilities, sub-prime loans, or any product with negative amortization. 

Home equity loans are secured primarily by second mortgages on residential property of the borrower. The underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permit borrowing availability, in the aggregate, up to 90% of the appraised value of the collateral property at the time of origination. We offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans, with variable rate loans underwritten at fully-indexed rates. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, DTI ratios, and credit scores. We do not offer home equity loan products with reduced documentation. 

Automobile loans include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles. We originate automobile loans and leases primarily on an indirect basis through selected dealerships. We require borrowers to maintain collision insurance on automobiles securing consumer loans, with us listed as loss payee. Our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicant&#8217;s overall financial capacity, including credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although an applicant&#8217;s creditworthiness is the primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount. 

Asset Quality 

Community-based lending personnel, along with region-based independent underwriting and analytic support staff, extend credit under guidelines established and administered by our Enterprise Risk Committee. This committee, which meets quarterly, is made up of independent outside directors. The committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies, credit exposures, peer comparisons, problem loans, and charge-offs. In addition, the committee reviews and approves recommended loan policy changes to assure our policy remains appropriate for the current lending environment. 

We lend to commercial and commercial real estate clients in various industries including manufacturing, agribusiness, transportation, mining, wholesaling, and retailing. Old National manages concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship, and loan size. At June 30, 2021, our average commercial loan size was approximately $260,000 and our average commercial real estate loan size was approximately $890,000. In addition, while loans to lessors of both residential and non-residential real estate exceed 10% of total loans, no individual sub-segment category within those broader categories reaches the 10% threshold. At June 30, 2021, we had minimal exposure to foreign borrowers and no sovereign debt. Our policy is to concentrate our lending activity in the geographic market areas we serve, primarily Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. We have experienced an adverse impact from COVID-19 during 2020 and during the first half of 2021; however, the depth of this crisis is ongoing and its effect is very broad-based. Management believes that trends in under-performing, criticized, and classified loans will be highly dependent on the distribution 

of vaccinations, as well as the length of time it will take consumers to return to their pre-pandemic spending routines. 

The following table presents a summary of under-performing, criticized, and classified assets: 

June 30, December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 2020 Total nonaccrual loans $ 128,268 &#160; $ 125,546 $ 147,339 TDRs still accruing 14,222 &#160; 16,582 17,749 Total past due loans (90 days or more and still accruing) 9 &#160; 779 167 Other real estate owned 520 &#160; 1,786 1,324 Total under-performing assets $ 143,019 &#160; $ 144,693 $ 166,579 Classified loans (includes nonaccrual, TDRs still accruing, past due 90 days, and other problem loans) $ 289,272 &#160; $ 318,758 $ 304,782 Other classified assets (1) 4,305 &#160; 2,565 3,706 Criticized loans 228,264 &#160; 220,300 287,192 Total criticized and classified assets $ 521,841 &#160; $ 541,623 $ 595,680 Asset Quality Ratios: Non-performing loans/total loans (2) (3) 1.03 &#160; % 1.04 % 1.20 % Under-performing assets/total loans and other real estate owned 1.04 &#160; 1.06 1.21 Under-performing assets/total assets 0.60 &#160; 0.65 0.73 Allowance/under-performing assets 76.52 &#160; 88.74 78.87 Allowance/nonaccrual loans 85.32 &#160; 102.27 89.17 

(1) Includes one pooled trust preferred security and two insurance policies at June 30, 2021. 

(2) Loans exclude loans held for sale. 

(3) Non-performing loans include nonaccrual loans and TDRs still accruing. 

Under-performing assets totaled $143.0 million at June 30, 2021, compared to $144.7 million at June 30, 2020 and $166.6 million at December 31, 2020. Under-performing assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate owned at June 30, 2021 were 1.04%, a 2 basis point improvement from 1.06% at June 30, 2020 and a 17 basis point improvement from 1.21% at December 31, 2020. 

Nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2020 primarily due to decreases in commercial, commercial real estate, and residential real estate nonaccrual loans. As a percentage of nonaccrual loans, the allowance was 85.32% at June 30, 2021, compared to 102.27% at June 30, 2020 and 89.17% at December 31, 2020. 

Total criticized and classified assets were $521.8 million at June 30, 2021, a decrease of $19.8 million from June 30, 2020, and a decrease of $73.8 million from December 31, 2020. Other classified assets include investment securities that fell below investment grade rating totaling $4.3 million at June 30, 2021, compared to $2.6 million at June 30, 2020 and $3.7 million at December 31, 2020. 

Old National may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans. The decision to restructure a loan, versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan, may benefit Old National by increasing the ultimate probability of collection. 

Any loans that are modified are reviewed by Old National to identify if a TDR has occurred, which is when, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, Old National Bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status. The modification of the terms of such loans includes one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan, an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate of new debt with similar risk, or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment of the loan. 

Loans modified in a TDR are typically placed on nonaccrual status until we determine that the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured, which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms for six months. 

If we are unable to resolve a nonperforming loan issue, the credit will be charged off when it is apparent there will be a loss. For large commercial type loans, each relationship is individually analyzed for evidence of apparent loss based on quantitative benchmarks or subjectively based upon certain events or particular circumstances. For residential and consumer loans, a charge off is recorded at the time foreclosure is initiated or when the loan becomes 120 to 180 days past due, whichever is earlier. 

For commercial TDRs, an allocated reserve is established within the allowance for credit losses for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and its computed value. To determine the computed value of the loan, one of the following methods is selected: (1) the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s original effective interest rate, (2) the loan&#8217;s observable market price, or (3) the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. The allocated reserve is established as the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the collectable value. If there are significant changes in the amount or timing of the loan&#8217;s expected future cash flows, impairment is recalculated and the valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly. 

When a residential or consumer loan is identified as a TDR, the loan is typically written down to its collateral value less selling costs. 

At June 30, 2021, TDRs consisted of $8.3 million of commercial loans, $16.0 million of commercial real estate loans, $0.1 million of BBCC loans, $2.5 of residential real estate loans, $0.7 million of direct consumer loans, and $0.2 million of home equity loans totaling $27.8 million. TDRs included within nonaccrual loans totaled $13.6 million at June 30, 2021. At December 31, 2020, TDRs consisted of $11.1 million of commercial loans, $17.6 million of commercial real estate loans, $0.1 million of BBCC loans, $2.8 million of residential real estate loans, $0.8 million of direct consumer loans, and $0.3 million of home equity loans, totaling $32.7 million. TDRs included within nonaccrual loans totaled $14.9 million at December 31, 2020. 

Old National has allocated specific reserves to customers whose loan terms have been modified as TDRs totaling $1.0 million at June 30, 2021 and $1.6 million of December 31, 2020. At June 30, 2021, Old National had committed to lend an additional $0.9 million to customers with outstanding loans that were classified as TDRs. At December 31, 2020, Old National had not committed to lend any additional funds to customers with outstanding loans that were classified as TDRs. 

The terms of certain other loans were modified during 2021 and 2020 that did not meet the definition of a TDR. It is our process to review all classified and criticized loans that, during the period, have been renewed, have entered into a forbearance agreement, have gone from principal and interest to interest only, or have extended the maturity date. In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. The evaluation is performed under our internal underwriting policy. We also evaluate whether a concession has been granted or if we were adequately compensated through a market interest rate, additional collateral, or a bona fide guarantee. We also consider whether the modification was insignificant relative to the other terms of the agreement or the delay in a payment. 

In general, once a modified loan is considered a TDR, the loan will always be considered a TDR, and therefore impaired, until it is paid in full, otherwise settled, sold, or charged off. However, guidance also permits for loans to be removed from TDR status when subsequently restructured under these circumstances: (1) at the time of the subsequent restructuring, the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulties, and this is documented by a current credit evaluation at the time of the restructuring, (2) under the terms of the subsequent restructuring agreement, the institution has granted no concession to the borrower; and (3) the subsequent restructuring agreement includes market terms that are no less favorable than those that would be offered for a comparable new loan. For loans subsequently restructured that have cumulative principal forgiveness, the loan should continue to be measured in accordance with ASC 310-10, Receivables &#8211; Overall . However, consistent with ASC 310-40-50-2, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, Creditor Disclosure of Troubled Debt Restructurings , the loan would not be required to be reported in the years following the restructuring if the subsequent restructuring meets both of these criteria: (1) has an interest rate at the time of the subsequent restructuring that is not less than a market interest rate; and (2) is performing in compliance with its modified terms after the subsequent restructuring. 

We have developed relief programs to assist borrowers in financial need due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Interagency Statement issued by our banking regulators encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations due to the effects of COVID-19. Additionally, Section 4013 of the CARES Act further provides that a qualified loan modification is exempt by law from classification as a TDR as defined by GAAP, from the period beginning March 1, 2020 until the earlier of December 31, 2020 or the date that is 60 days after the date on which the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak declared by the President of the United States under the National Emergencies Act terminates. The Interagency Statement was subsequently revised in April 2020 to clarify the interaction of the original guidance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as well as setting forth the banking regulators&#8217; views on consumer protection considerations. Additionally, section 541 of the CAA extended the relief provided by the CARES Act for financial institutions to suspend the GAAP accounting treatment for troubled debt restructuring to January 1, 2022. In accordance with such guidance, we are offering short-term modifications made in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who are current and otherwise not past due. These include short-term (180 days or less) modifications in the form of payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant. The table below presents these loan deferrals by loan category: 

December 31, 2020 June 30, 2021 (dollars in thousands) Deferrals Balance Deferrals Balance (1) Number of Deferrals Commercial and commercial real estate $ 53,823 $ 17,313 &#160; 40 &#160; Residential real estate 1,855 264 &#160; 4 &#160; Consumer 8,224 4,104 &#160; 217 &#160; Total $ 63,902 $ 21,681 &#160; 261 &#160; 

(1) Includes second deferrals between 90 and 180 days totaling $2.5 million of commercial and commercial real estate loans, $0.1 million of residential real estate loans, and $0.6 million of consumer loans. 

U.S. Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program 

Section 1102 of the CARES Act created the PPP, a program administered by the SBA to provide loans to small businesses for payroll and other basic expenses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Old National has participated in the PPP as a lender. These loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied and are fully guaranteed by the SBA. Additionally, loan payments will also be deferred for the first six months of the loan term. The PPP commenced on April 3, 2020 and was available to qualified borrowers through August 8, 2020. No collateral or personal guarantees are required. Neither the government nor lenders are permitted to charge the recipients any fees. During 2020, Old National originated over 9,700 loans with balances in excess of $1.5 billion to new and existing customers through the PPP. As of June 30, 2021, we have received payment from the SBA on 8,170, or 83%, of these loans totaling $1.3 billion. 

On December 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the CAA. The CAA, among other things, extends the life of the PPP, effectively creating a second round of PPP loans for eligible businesses. Old National has participated in the CAA&#8217;s second round of PPP lending. In mid-January we opened our lending portal and began processing PPP loan applications. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, Old National originated approximately 6,200 loans totaling $583.7 million through the second round of the PPP. As of June 30, 2021, we have received payment from the SBA on 1,112, or 18%, of second round PPP loans totaling $64.1 million. 

At June 30, 2021, remaining PPP loans totaled $721.1 million. 

To the extent the PPP loans are forgiven, this represents outside equity contributions to our borrowers; and, especially with respect to vulnerable industries, we believe these capital injections are going to be instrumental in assisting our borrowers in navigating through the pandemic. This capital injection, along with the level of capital each borrower had just prior to COVID-19 impacting them, are critical factors in determining the staying power of our borrowers. Upon receipt of interim financial results from our borrowers, we will use that information to update our understanding of the underlying strengths or weaknesses in each individual relationship and take actions, as appropriate. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Unfunded Commitments 

Net recoveries on loans totaled $0.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, compared to $0.5 million of net charge-offs for the three months ended June 30, 2020. Annualized, net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans were (0.01)% for the three months ended June 30, 2021, compared to 0.02% for the three months ended June 30, 2020. Net recoveries on loans totaled $0.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to $7.1 

million of net charge-offs for the six months ended June 30, 2020. Annualized, net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans were 0.00% for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to 0.11% for the six months ended June 30, 2020. Management will continue its efforts to reduce the level of non-performing loans and may consider the possibility of sales of troubled and non-performing loans, which could result in additional charge-offs to the allowance for credit losses on loans. 

Credit quality within the loans held for investment portfolio is continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses for loans. The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the Company&#8217;s loans held for investment portfolio. Credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process for estimating expected credit losses. Expected credit loss inherent in non-cancelable off-balance-sheet credit exposures is accounted for as a separate liability included in other liabilities on the balance sheet. The allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment is adjusted by a credit loss expense, which is reported in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 

The allowance for credit loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of our loan portfolio segments. These segments are further disaggregated into loan classes based on the level at which credit risk of the loan is monitored. When computing the level of expected credit losses, credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history, delinquency status, and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, evaluations of the overall loan portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods. 

The allowance level is influenced by loan volumes, loan AQR migration or delinquency status, changes in historical loss experience, and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. The methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses has two basic components: first, an asset-specific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans; and second, a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics. 

The allowance for credit losses for loans was $109.4 million at June 30, 2021, compared to $131.4 million at December 31, 2020. Continued loan growth in future periods, a decline in our current level of recoveries, or an increase in charge-offs could result in an increase in provision expense. Additionally, with the adoption of CECL beginning on January 1, 2020, provision expense may become more volatile due to changes in CECL model assumptions of credit quality, macroeconomic factors and conditions, and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses balance. 

We maintain an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses for loans, modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet within accrued expenses and other liabilities, while the corresponding provision for these credit losses is recorded as a component of other expense. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments totaled $10.4 million at June 30, 2021, compared to $11.7 million at December 31, 2020. 

Market Risk 

Market risk is the risk that the estimated fair value of our assets, liabilities, and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility, or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes. 

The objective of our interest rate management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. 

Potential cash flows, sales, or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities, especially those that earn or pay interest, are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. This interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, customer preferences, historical pricing relationships, and re-pricing characteristics of financial instruments. Our earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. 

In managing interest rate risk, we, through our Funds Management Committee, a committee of the Board of Directors, establish guidelines, for asset and liability management, including measurement of short and long-term sensitivities to changes in interest rates. Based on the results of our analysis, we may use different techniques to manage changing trends in interest rates including: 

&#8226; adjusting balance sheet mix or altering interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities; 

&#8226; changing product pricing strategies; 

&#8226; modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio; or 

&#8226; using derivative financial instruments, to a limited degree. 

A key element in our ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a model to quantify the likely impact of changing interest rates on Old National&#8217;s results of operations. The model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income. The model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario. The base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are held at current levels. Interest rates are floored at 0.00% in the down 50 basis points scenario. The model shows our projected net interest income sensitivity based on interest rate changes only and does not consider other forecast assumptions. 

The following table illustrates our projected net interest income sensitivity over a two year cumulative horizon based on the asset/liability model at June 30, 2021 and 2020:

Our asset sensitivity increased year over year primarily due to deposit pricing actions and changes in our hedging strategies, balance sheet mix, investment duration, and prepayment speed behavior. 

A key element in the measurement and modeling of interest rate risk is the re-pricing assumptions of our transaction deposit accounts, which have no contractual maturity dates. Because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income, we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results. For this reason, we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes, including shocks, ramps, yield curve flattening, yield curve steepening, as well as forecasts of likely interest rate scenarios tested. At June 30, 2021, our projected net interest income sensitivity based on the asset/liability models we utilize was within the limits of our interest rate risk policy for the scenarios tested. 

We use cash flow and fair value hedges, primarily interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, to mitigate interest rate risk. Derivatives designated as hedging instruments were in a net asset position with a fair value of $13.3 million at June 30, 2021, compared to a net asset position with a fair value of $15.2 million at December 31, 2020. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments. 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments, or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources. The Funds Management Committee of the Board of 

Directors establishes liquidity risk guidelines and, along with the Balance Sheet Management Committee, monitors liquidity risk. The objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner. Management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities, funding sources, and loan and deposit forecasts. We maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth, properly manage capital markets&#8217; funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements. On June 5, 2020, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC that permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities. 

Loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds. However, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, the housing market, general and local economic conditions, and competition in the marketplace. We continually monitor marketplace trends to identify patterns that might improve the predictability of the timing of deposit flows or asset prepayments. 

A maturity schedule for Old National Bank&#8217;s time deposits is shown in the following table at June 30, 2021.

Old National Bank maintains relationships in capital markets with brokers and dealers to issue certificates of deposit and short-term and medium-term bank notes as well. At June 30, 2021, Old National and its subsidiaries had the following availability of liquid funds and borrowings: 

(dollars in thousands) Parent Company Subsidiaries Available liquid funds: Cash and due from banks $ 99,185 $ 391,946 Unencumbered government-issued debt securities &#8212; 3,116,059 Unencumbered investment grade municipal securities &#8212; 972,511 Unencumbered corporate securities &#8212; 157,084 Availability of borrowings: Amount available from Federal Reserve discount window* &#8212; 452,008 Amount available from Federal Home Loan Bank Indianapolis* &#8212; 221,836 Total available funds $ 99,185 $ 5,311,444 

* Based on collateral pledged 

Old National Bancorp has routine funding requirements consisting primarily of operating expenses, dividends to shareholders, debt service, net derivative cash flows, and funds used for acquisitions. Old National Bancorp can obtain funding to meet its obligations from dividends and management fees collected from its subsidiaries, operating line of credit, and through the issuance of debt securities. Additionally, Old National Bancorp has a shelf registration in place with the SEC permitting ready access to the public debt and equity markets. At June 30, 2021, Old National Bancorp&#8217;s other borrowings outstanding were $213.4 million. Management believes the Company has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its requirements in the short-term and the long-term. 

Federal banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by banking subsidiaries without prior approval. Prior regulatory approval is required if dividends to be declared in any year would exceed net earnings of the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two years. Prior regulatory approval to pay dividends was not required in 2020 and is not currently required. 

Operational/Technology/Cyber Risk 

Operational/technology/cyber risk is the danger that inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, information security breaches, fraud, or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses and other adverse impacts to Old National, such as reputational harm. We maintain frameworks, programs, and internal controls to prevent or minimize financial loss from failure of systems, people, or processes. This includes specific programs and frameworks intended to prevent or limit the effects of cyber risks including cyber-attacks or other information security breaches that might allow unauthorized transactions or unauthorized access to customer, associate, or company sensitive information. Metrics and measurements are used by our management team in the management of day-to-day operations to ensure effective customer service, minimization of service disruptions, and oversight of operational and cyber risk. We continually monitor and report on operational, technology, and cyber risks related to clients, products, and business practices; external and internal fraud; business disruptions and systems failures; cyber-attacks, information security or data breaches; damage to physical assets; and execution, delivery, and process management. 

The Enterprise Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight, guidance, and monitoring of risks, including operational/technology/cyber risks, being taken by the Company. The monitoring is accomplished through ongoing review of management reports, data on risks and policy limits, and consistent discussion on enterprise risk management strategies, policies, and risk assessments. 

Regulatory/Compliance/Legal Risk 

Regulatory/compliance/legal risk is the risk that the Company violated or was not in compliance with applicable laws, regulations or practices, industry standards, or ethical standards. The legal portion assesses the risk that unenforceable contracts, lawsuits, or adverse judgments can disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the Company. The Board of Directors expects we will perform business in a manner compliant with applicable laws and/or regulations and expects issues to be identified, analyzed, and remediated in a timely and complete manner. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

Off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees. Commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees are used to meet the financial needs of our customers. Our banking affiliates have entered into various agreements to extend credit, including loan commitments of $4.151 billion and standby letters of credit of $72.0 million at June 30, 2021. At June 30, 2021, approximately $3.901 billion of the loan commitments had fixed rates and $250.4 million had floating rates, with the floating rates ranging from 0% to 14%. At December 31, 2020, loan commitments were $3.720 billion and standby letters of credit were $86.9 million. The term of these off-balance sheet arrangements is typically one year or less. 

Old National is a party in risk participation transactions of interest rate swaps, which had total notional amount of $74.8 million at June 30, 2021. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 

The following table presents our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations at June 30, 2021: 

&#160; Payments Due In &#160; (dollars in thousands) One Year or Less (1) One to Three Years Three to Five Years Over Five Years Total Deposits without stated maturity $ 16,866,392 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ 16,866,392 IRAs, consumer, and brokered certificates of deposit 469,563 434,035 79,992 18,929 1,002,519 Federal funds purchased and interbank borrowings 1,523 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 1,523 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 396,129 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 396,129 FHLB advances &#8212; 29,155 575,000 1,286,988 1,891,143 Other borrowings 1,006 4,192 179,400 85,720 270,318 Fixed interest payments (2) 17,360 66,670 54,569 62,683 201,282 Operating leases 7,066 22,786 16,885 50,549 97,286 Other long-term liabilities (3) 19,857 14,067 157 22 34,103 

(1) For the remaining six months of fiscal 2021. 

(2) Our senior notes, subordinated notes, certain trust preferred securities, and certain FHLB advances have fixed rates ranging from 0.45% to 4.96%. All of our other long-term debt is at LIBOR based variable rates at June 30, 2021. The projected variable interest assumes no increase in LIBOR rates from June 30, 2021. 

(3) Includes unfunded commitments on qualified affordable housing projects and other tax credit investments. 

We rent certain premises and equipment under operating leases. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term lease arrangements. 

We are party to various derivative contracts as a means to manage the balance sheet and our related exposure to changes in interest rates, to manage our residential real estate loan origination and sale activity, and to provide derivative contracts to our clients. Since the derivative liabilities recorded on the balance sheet change frequently and do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts, these liabilities are not included in the table of contractual obligations presented above. Further discussion of derivative instruments is included in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. 

In the normal course of business, various legal actions and proceedings are pending against us and our affiliates which are incidental to the business in which they are engaged. Further discussion of contingent liabilities is included in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. 

In addition, liabilities recorded under FASB ASC 740-10 (FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes &#8211; an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ) are not included in the table because the amount and timing of any cash payments cannot be reasonably estimated. Further discussion of income taxes and liabilities is included in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Certain accounting policies require management to use significant judgment and estimates, which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. We consider these policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgment and assumptions made are based upon historical experience, future forecasts, or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions, actual results could differ from estimates, which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

The following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant judgments and estimates. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our Audit Committee. 

Goodwill 

&#8226; Description. For acquisitions, we are required to record the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets such as goodwill, and the liabilities assumed at their fair value. These often involve estimates based on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition, inflation, asset growth rates, or other relevant factors. The carrying value of goodwill recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill. 

&#8226; Judgments and Uncertainties. The determination of fair values is based on valuations using management&#8217;s assumptions of future growth rates, future attrition, discount rates, multiples of earnings or other relevant factors. 

&#8226; Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions. Changes in these factors, as well as downturns in economic or business conditions, could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of goodwill and could result in impairment losses affecting our financial statements as a whole and our banking subsidiary in which the goodwill resides. 

&#8226; Pandemic. A prolonged COVID-19 outbreak, or any other epidemic that harms the global economy, U.S. economy, or the economies in which we operate could adversely affect our operations. Based on the required annual impairment test as of August 31, 2020, we have concluded that our goodwill was not impaired. On a quarterly basis, we will continue to evaluate our qualitative assessment assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, including: (1) forecasted revenues, expenses, and cash flows; (2) current discount rates; (3) our market capitalization; (4) observable market transactions and multiples; (5) changes to the regulatory environment; and (6) the nature and amount of government support that has been and is expected to be provided in the future. A prolonged economic downturn or deterioration in the economic outlook may lead management to conclude that an interim quantitative impairment test of our goodwill is required prior to the annual impairment test conducted on August 31. 

Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans 

&#8226; Description. The allowance for credit losses for loans represents management&#8217;s estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our loan portfolio. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the then-existing loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods. 

The allowance for credit losses for loans, as reported in our consolidated statements of financial condition, is adjusted by an expense for credit losses, which is recognized in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. 

&#8226; Judgments and Uncertainties. We utilize a discounted cashflow approach to determine the allowance for credit losses for performing loans and nonperforming loans. Expected cashflows are created for each loan and discounted using the effective yield. The discounted sum of expected cashflows is then compared to the amortized cost and any shortfall is recorded as reserve. Expected cashflows are created using a combination 

of contractual payment schedules, calculated PDs, LGD and prepayment assumptions as well as qualitative factors. For the commercial and commercial real estate loans, the PD is forecast using a regression model to determine the likelihood of a loan moving into nonaccrual within the time horizon. For residential and consumer loans, the PD is forecast using a regression model to determine the likelihood of a loan being charged-off within the time horizon. The regression models use combinations of variables to assess systematic and unsystematic risk. Variables used for unsystematic risk are borrower specific and help to gauge the risk of default from an individual borrower. Variables for systematic risk, risk inherent to all borrowers, come from the use of forward-looking economic forecasts and include variables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and house price index. The LGD is defined as credit loss incurred when an obligor of the bank defaults. Qualitative factors include items such as changes in lending policies or procedures and economic uncertainty in forward-looking forecasts. 

&#8226; Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions. The allowance represents management&#8217;s best estimate, but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance. Likewise, an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance. In either instance, unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations. 

The expense for credit loss recorded through earnings is the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses at the amount of expected credit losses inherent within the loans held for investment portfolio. The amount of expense and the corresponding level of allowance for credit losses for loans are based on our evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other significant qualitative and quantitative factors. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

&#8226; Description. As part of our overall interest rate risk management, we use derivative instruments to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and market prices for financial instruments. The application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness, identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items. To the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective, changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income. Management believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in preparation of the financial statements. All of the derivative financial instruments we use have an active market and indications of fair value can be readily obtained. We are not using the &#8220;short-cut&#8221; method of accounting for any fair value derivatives. 

&#8226; Judgments and Uncertainties. The application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness, identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items. 

&#8226; Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions. To the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective, changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income. However, if in the future the derivative financial instruments used by us no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment, all changes in fair value of the derivative would flow through the consolidated statements of income in other noninterest income, resulting in greater volatility in our earnings. 

Income Taxes 

&#8226; Description. We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states, and the municipalities in which we operate. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. We review income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets quarterly; and as new information becomes available, the balances are adjusted as appropriate. FASB ASC 740-10 (FIN 48) prescribes a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not, and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of our provision and related income tax assets and liabilities. 

&#8226; Judgments and Uncertainties. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review/adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. 

&#8226; Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates used are reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would result in a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. 

Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to it in this &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221;
