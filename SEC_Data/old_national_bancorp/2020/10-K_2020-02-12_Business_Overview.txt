GENERAL

Old National is a financial holding company incorporated in the state of Indiana and maintains its principal executive office in Evansville, Indiana. We, through our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, provide a wide range of services, including commercial and consumer loan and depository services, private banking, brokerage, trust, investment advisory, and other traditional banking services. At December 31, 2019, we employed 2,709 full-time equivalent associates.

COMPANY PROFILE

Old National Bank, our wholly-owned banking subsidiary (&#8220;Old National Bank&#8221;), was founded in 1834 and is the oldest company in Evansville, Indiana. In 1982, Old National Bancorp was formed&#59; in 2001 we became a financial holding company and we are currently the largest financial holding company headquartered in the state of Indiana with consolidated assets of $20.4 billion at December 31, 2019.

At December 31, 2019, Old National Bank operated 192 banking centers located primarily in Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Each of the branches of Old National Bank provide a group of similar community banking services, including such products and services as commercial, real estate and consumer loans, time deposits, checking and savings accounts, cash management, brokerage, trust, and investment advisory services. The individual bank branches located throughout our Midwest footprint have similar operating and economic characteristics.

We earn interest income on loans as well as fee income from the origination of loans. Lending activities include loans to individuals, which primarily consist of home equity lines of credit, residential real estate loans and consumer loans, and loans to commercial clients, which include commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, letters of credit, and lease financing. Residential real estate loans are either kept in our loan portfolio or sold to secondary investors, with gains or losses from the sales being recognized.

We strive to serve individuals and commercial clients by providing depository services that fit their needs at competitive rates. We pay interest on the interest-bearing deposits and receive service fee revenue on various accounts. Deposit accounts include products such as noninterest-bearing demand, interest-bearing checking and NOW, savings and money market, and time deposits. Debit and ATM cards provide clients with access to their accounts 24 hours a day at any ATM location. We also provide 24-hour telephone access and online banking as well as other electronic and mobile banking services.

In addition to the community banking services of lending and providing deposit services, we offer comprehensive wealth management, investment, and foreign currency services. For businesses, we provide treasury management, merchant, health savings, and capital markets services as well as community development lending and equity investment solutions that produce jobs and revitalize our communities.

&#160;

In January 2020, Old National commenced implementation of a strategic plan (&#8220;The ONB Way&#8221;) , which has various detailed business objectives designed to keep the Company&#8217;s clients at the center of all we do. The ONB Way includes :

ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE STRATEGY

Since the formation of Old National in 1982, we have acquired over 50 financial institutions and other financial services businesses. Future acquisitions and divestitures will be driven by a disciplined financial evaluation process and will be consistent with the existing basic banking strategy which focuses on community banking, client relationships, and consistent quality earnings. Targeted geographic markets for acquisitions include mid-size markets with average to above average growth rates.

&#160;

We anticipate that, a s with previous acquisitions, the consideration paid by us in future acquisitions may be in the form of cash, debt , or Old National stock , or a combination thereof . The amount and structure of such consideration is based on reasonable growth and cost savings assumptions and a thorough analysis of the impact on both long- and short-term financial results. 

Our most recent acquisitions included the following:

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Michigan-based Founders Financial Corporation through a stock and cash merger on January 1, 2015 that added four branches in the Grand Rapids, Michigan market&#59; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Anchor BanCorp Wisconsin Inc. through a stock and cash merger on May 1, 2016 that added 46 branches in the Madison, Milwaukee, and Fox Valley triangle markets&#59; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Anchor Bank, N.A., headquartered in the Twin Cities, through a stock and cash merger on November 1, 2017 that added 17 branches in Minnesota&#59; and

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Minnesota-based Klein through a 100% stock merger on November 1, 2018 that added 18 branches serving the Twin Cities and its western communities. 

##TABLE_END

In regard to future partnerships, we are an active looker and a selective buyer. We are patient and continue to wait for the perfect pitch while we remain focused on execution .

Divestitures

On August 14, 2015, Old National divested its southern Illinois region (twelve branches) along with four branches in eastern Indiana and one in Ohio. At closing, the purchasers assumed loans of $193.6 million and deposits of $555.8 million. Old National recorded a net pre-tax gain of $15.6 million in connection with the divestitures, which included a deposit premium of $19.3 million, goodwill allocation of $3.8 million, and $0.9 million of other transaction expenses . 

On May 31, 2016, the Company sold its insurance operations, ONI. The Company received approximately $91.8 million in cash resulting in a pre-tax gain of $41.9 million and an a fter-tax gain of $17.6 million. Goodwill and intangible assets of approximately $47.5 million were eliminated as part of this transaction. ONI was an ancillary business and did not meet the criteria to be treated as a discontinued operation as defined in Accounting Standards Update 2014-08, &#8220;Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.&#8221; 

On October 26, 2018, the Company divested ten branches in Wisconsin to Marine Credit Union of La Crosse, Wisconsin. At closing, the purchasers assumed $230.6 million in deposits and no loans. Old National recorded a net pre-tax gain of $14.0 million in connection with the sale, which included a deposit premium of $15.0 million, goodwill allocation of $0.6 million, and $0.4 million of other transaction expenses .

Since the beginning of 2011 through the end of 2019, we have consolidated 159 banking centers. Over the same period, we have more than doubled our assets and have increased our average total deposits per branch from $34 million to approximately $76 million, while only increasing our number of banking centers by 31 to 192.

Another component of The ONB Way is the optimization of our branch network. This optimization, which includes 31 banking centers scattered throughout the footprint that will be consolidated in April 2020, reflects an ongoing shift among our clients toward digital banking solutions. Many of the facilities to be consolidated are in smaller markets, several of which were added in recent years through partnership activity. By state, these consolidations include ten banking centers in both Wisconsin and Indiana, five in Michigan, four in Minnesota, and two in Kentucky.

COMPETITION

The banking industry and related financial service providers operate in a highly competitive market. Old National competes with financial service providers such as other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market mutual funds, and other financial intermediaries. In addition, Financial Technology, or FinTech, start-ups are emerging in key areas of banking.

Many of our nonfinancial institution competitors have fewer regulatory constraints, broader geographic service areas, greater capital, and, in some cases, lower cost structures. In addition, competition for quality customers has intensified as a result of changes in regulation, mergers and acquisitions, advances in technology and product 

&#160;

delivery systems, consolidation among financial service providers, bank failures, and the conversion of certain former investment banks to bank holding companies. 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

Old National is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws. The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders and creditors.

Significant elements of the laws and regulations applicable to Old National and its subsidiaries are described below. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are described. Also, such statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to Old National and its subsidiaries, for which Old National cannot predict, could have a material effect on the business of the Company.

The Dodd-Frank Act. On July 21, 2010, financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act&#8221; (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly restructured the financial regulatory environment in the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous provisions that affect all bank holding companies and banks, including Old National and Old National Bank, some of which are described in more detail below. The scope and impact of many of the Dodd-Frank Act provisions were determined and issued over time. The impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on Old National has been substantial. Provisions in the legislation affect the payment of interest on demand deposits, collection of interchange fees associated with certain deposits, and placed limits on certain revenues on those deposits. 

The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Economic Growth Act&#8221;), which was enacted in May 2018, repealed or modified several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Certain key provisions of the Economic Growth Act and its implementing regulations include:

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

elimination of supervisory stress testing and company run stress testing for bank holding companies with less than $250 billion in assets&#59; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

prohibiting federal banking regulators from imposing higher capital standards on High Volatility Commercial Real Estate exposures unless they are for acquisition, development, or construction&#59; 

##TABLE_END

&#8226; 

exempting from appraisal requirements certain transactions involving real property in rural areas and valued at less than $400,000&#59; and 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

requiring the CFPB to provide guidance on how the Truth in Lending Act-Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act Integrated Disclosure applies to mortgage assumption transactions and construction-to-permanent home loans, as well the extent to which lenders can rely on model disclosures that do not reflect recent regulatory changes. 

##TABLE_END

The Volcker Rule . Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions prohibiting proprietary trading and restricting the activities involving private equity and hedge funds (the &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221;). Rules implementing the Volcker Rule were adopted in December 2013. Proprietary trading is defined as the trading of securities, derivatives, or futures (or options on any of the foregoing) as principal, where such trading is principally for the purpose of short-term resale, benefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements and realizing short-term arbitrage profits. The rule&#8217;s definition of proprietary trading specifically excludes market-making-related activity, certain government issued securities trading and certain risk management activities. Old National and Old National Bank do not engage in any prohibited proprietary trading activities. During 2019, the federal financial agencies announced revisions to the Volcker Rule that will simplify and streamline compliance requirements for Old National Bank. 

Bank Holding Company Regulation. Old National is registered as a bank holding company and has elected to be a financial holding company. It is subject to the supervision of, and regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;). The Federal Reserve has issued regulations under the BHC Act requiring a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that, pursuant to this requirement, a bank holding company should stand ready to use its resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity. Under this requirement, Old National is expected to commit resources to support Old National Bank, including at times when Old National 

&#160;

may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. 

The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve to acquire more than a 5% voting interest of any bank or bank holding company. Additionally, the BHC Act restricts Old National&#8217;s non-banking activities to those which are determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking and a proper incident thereto.

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;), a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; (as defined in FDICIA) with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal bank regulatory agency.

Capital and Liquidity Requirements . Bank holding companies are required to comply with the Federal Reserve&#8217;s risk-based capital guidelines. The FDIC and the OCC have adopted risk-based capital ratio guidelines to which depository institutions under their respective supervision, including Old National Bank, are subject. The guidelines establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations. Risk-based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet commitments to four risk-weighted categories, with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk. Old National Bank exceeded all risk-based minimum capital requirements of the FDIC and OCC as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. For Old National&#8217;s regulatory capital ratios and regulatory requirements as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, see Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements. 

The federal regulatory authorities&#8217; current risk-based capital guidelines are based upon the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;). The Basel Committee is a committee of international central banks and bank regulators responsible for establishing international supervisory guidelines for use in member jurisdictions to enhance and align bank regulation on a global scale and promote financial stability. In December 2010 and January 2011, the Basel Committee published the final revisions to the international regulatory capital framework generally referred to as &#8220;Basel III,&#8221; as a response to deficiencies in the international regulatory standards identified during the global financial crisis.

Effective July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve and the OCC approved final rules known as the &#8220;Basel III Capital Rules&#8221; substantially revising the risk-based capital and leverage capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including Old National and Old National Bank. The Basel III Capital Rules address the components of capital and other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies&#8217; rules. Certain of the Basel III Capital Rules came into effect for Old National and Old National Bank on January 1, 2015&#59; subject to a phase-in period ending on December 31, 2018.

The Basel III Capital Rules introduced a new capital measure &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;). The rules specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting specified requirements. CET1 capital consists of common stock instruments that meet the eligibility criteria in the final rules, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and common equity Tier 1 minority interest. The rules also define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1, and not to the other components of capital. They also expand the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations. 

&#160;

As of January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules require banking organizations to maintain: 

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%)&#59; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%)&#59; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

a minimum ratio of total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%)&#59; and 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average consolidated assets. 

##TABLE_END

The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face limitations on the payment of dividends, common stock repurchases and discretionary cash payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall.

The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Beginning in 2020, this framework for regulatory capital deductions to CET1 will be simplified by increasing the deduction threshold to 25% at the individual level for each of the aforementioned categories. Under current capital standards, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital are excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, Old National and Old National Bank are given a one-time election (the &#8220;Opt-out Election&#8221;) to filter certain AOCI components, comparable to the treatment under the current general risk-based capital rule. The Company chose the Opt-out Election on the March 31, 2015 Call Report and FR Y-9C for Old National Bank and Old National, respectively.

Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and have been phased-in over a five-year period (20% per year). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and was phased-in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reached 2.5% on January 1, 2019).

The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a &#8220;countercyclical capital buffer&#8221; that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and is not expected to have any current applicability to Old National or Old National Bank.

In addition, the Basel III Capital Rules revise the rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance their risk sensitivity. They establish a new framework under which mortgage-backed securities and other securitization exposures will be subject to risk-weights ranging from 20% to 1,250%. The rules also establish adjusted risk-weights for credit exposures, including multi-family and commercial real estate exposures that are 90 days or more past due or on non-accrual, which will be subject to a 150% risk-weight, except in situations where qualifying collateral and/or guarantees are in place. The existing treatment of residential mortgage exposures will remain subject to either a 50% risk-weight (for prudently underwritten owner-occupied first liens that are current or less than 90 days past due) or a 100% risk-weight (for all other residential mortgage exposures including 90 days or more past due exposures).

Management believes that, as of December 31, 2019, Old National and Old National Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently effective. Requirements to maintain higher levels of capital or to maintain higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s net income.

The Basel III Capital Rules permit banks with less than $15 billion in assets to continue to treat trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital. This treatment is permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 capital for organic growth but not as a result of a merger or acquisition. On November 1, 2017, Old National acquired Anchor (MN) and exceeded $15 billion in assets. As the result of this acquisition, Tier 1 treatment of trust preferred securities is prohibited and those securities can only be treated as Tier 2 capital. The Basel III Capital Rules also permit banks with less than 

&#160;

$250 billion in assets to choose to continue excluding unrealized gains and losses on certain securities holdings for purposes of calculating regulatory capital. As previously reported, Old National chose the Opt-out Election in its March 31, 2015 Call Report. Additionally, the Basel III Capital Rules limit a banking organization&#8217;s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; consisting of a specified amount of CET1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. 

The liquidity framework under the Basel III Capital Rules (the &#8220;Basel III liquidity framework&#8221;) applies a balance sheet perspective to establish quantitative standards designed to ensure that a banking organization is appropriately positioned to satisfy its short- and long-term funding needs. One test to address short-term liquidity risk is referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (&#8220;LCR&#8221;), designed to calculate the ratio of a banking entity&#8217;s high-quality liquid assets to its total net cashflows over a 30-day time horizon. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (&#8220;NSFR&#8221;), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term asset funding by incenting banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt, as well as increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source. The Basel III liquidity framework was implemented as a minimum standard on January 1, 2015, with a phase-in period ending January 1, 2019. However, the federal banking agencies have not proposed rules implementing the Basel III liquidity framework and have not determined to what extent it will apply to U.S. banks that are not large, internationally active banks.

Management believes that, as of December 31, 2019, Old National Bank would meet the LCR requirement under the Basel III liquidity framework on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently effective. Management&#8217;s evaluation of the impact of the NSFR requirement is ongoing as of December 31, 2019. Requirements to maintain higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s net income.

Prompt Corrective Action Regulations . The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#8220;FDIA&#8221;) requires, among other things, federal bank regulatory authorities to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to banks which do not meet minimum capital requirements. Under current prompt corrective action regulations, a bank will be (i) &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure&#59; (ii) &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;&#59; (iii) &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%&#59; (iv) &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%&#59; and (v) &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if the institution&#8217;s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank&#8217;s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank&#8217;s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. 

The Basel III Capital Rules revised the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA, by:

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status&#59; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8.0% (as compared to the previous 6.0%)&#59; and 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

eliminating the provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3.0% leverage ratio and still be well-capitalized. 

##TABLE_END

The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; &#8220;Undercapitalized&#8221; institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The agencies may not accept such a plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution&#8217;s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution&#8217;s parent holding company must 

&#160;

guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5.0% of the depository institution&#8217;s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is &#8220;significantly undercapitalized.&#8221; 

&#8220;Significantly undercapitalized&#8221; depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. &#8220;Critically undercapitalized&#8221; institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.

Management believes that, as of December 31, 2019, Old National Bank was &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; based on the existing ratios and the ratios as modified by the Basel III Capital Rules.

Deposit Insurance . Substantially all of the deposits of Old National Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) of the FDIC and Old National Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. Deposit insurance assessments are based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. Under the FDIC&#8217;s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions with at least $10 billion in assets, such as Old National Bank, are assessed on the basis of a scoring system that combines the institution&#8217;s regulatory ratings and certain financial measures. The scoring system assesses risk measures to produce two scores, a performance score and a loss severity score, that will be combined and converted to an initial assessment rate. 

The performance score measures an institution&#8217;s financial performance and its ability to withstand stress. The loss severity score quantifies the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of an institution&#8217;s failure. Once the performance and loss severity scores are calculated, these scores will be converted to a total score. An institution with a total score of 30 or less will pay the minimum base assessment rate, and an institution with a total score of 90 or more will pay the maximum initial base assessment rate. For total scores between 30 and 90, initial base assessment rates will rise at an increasing rate as the total score increases. The FDIC has the authority to raise or lower assessment rates, subject to limits, and to impose special additional assessments.

Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.

Safety and Soundness Regulations. In accordance with the FDIA, the federal banking agencies adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. In addition, regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies authorize the agencies to require that an institution that has been given notice that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, the institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing corrective actions and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; provisions of FDIA. If the institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties. 

Incentive Compensation . &#160; The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets, such as Old National and Old National Bank, that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The agencies proposed such regulations in April 2011, but the regulations have not been finalized. If 

&#160;

the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which Old National may structure compensation for its executives. 

In June 2010, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees who have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#8217;s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#8217;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#8217;s board of directors. These three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint compensation regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act, discussed above.

The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as Old National, that are not &#8220;large, complex banking organizations.&#8221; These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#8217;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization&#8217;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization&#8217;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. 

Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#8217;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.

Loans to One Borrower. Old National Bank generally may not make loans or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, up to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2019, Old National Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one-borrower limitations. 

Depositor Preference . The FDIA provides that, in the event of the &#8220;liquidation or other resolution&#8221; of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the United States and the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution. 

Community Reinvestment Act . The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA and are assigned ratings that must be publicly disclosed. In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; in its most recent examination under the CRA. Furthermore, banking regulators take into account CRA ratings when considering approval of certain applications. Old National Bank received a rating of &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; in its latest CRA examination. 

Fair Lending Laws. Fair Lending laws prohibit discrimination in banking services and include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (&#8220;ECOA&#8221;) and the Fair Housing Act (&#8220;FHA&#8221;), which prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, or other prohibited factors in the extension of credit and residential real estate transactions. In May 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (&#8220;DOJ&#8221;) and KleinBank entered into a public Settlement Agreement (&#8220;Agreement&#8221;) regarding alleged violations of the FHA and the ECOA within the Minneapolis, Minnesota market. 

&#160;

Old National Bank, as the legal successor in interest to KleinBank, has assumed the ongoing terms and obligations of the Agreement. 

Financial Privacy. &#160; The federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. 

Old National Bank is also subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. These guidelines describe the federal banking agencies&#8217; expectations for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, which would include administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities. The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.

Anti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act. A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the &#8220;USA Patriot Act&#8221;) substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations on financial institutions, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. 

The anti-money laundering (&#8220;AML&#8221;) rules codify within the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (the &#8220;FinCEN&#8221;) regulations the &#8220;pillars&#8221; that must be included in a financial institutions AML compliance program. Regulators have communicated their expectations with respect to five pillars: (1) the development of internal policies, procedures, and control&#59; (2) the designation of a compliance officer&#59; (3) the establishment of an ongoing employee training program&#59; (4) the implementation of an independent audit function to test programs&#59; and (5) appropriate risk based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation. The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others which are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. 

Transactions with Affiliates. Transactions between Old National Bank and its affiliates are regulated by the Federal Reserve under sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and related regulations. These regulations limit the types and amounts of covered transactions engaged in by Old National Bank and generally require those transactions to be on an arm&#8217;s-length basis. The term &#8220;affiliate&#8221; is defined to mean any company that controls or is under common control with Old National Bank and includes Old National and its non-bank subsidiaries. &#8220;Covered transactions&#8221; include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve) from the affiliate, certain derivative transactions that create a credit exposure to an affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. In general, these regulations require that any such transaction by Old National Bank (or its subsidiaries) with an affiliate must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and must be limited to certain thresholds on an individual and aggregate basis. 

Federal law also limits Old National Bank&#8217;s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that 

&#160;

are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. Also, the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Old National Bank&#8217;s capital. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System. Old National Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. As a member of the FHLBI, Old National Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock of the FHLBI in an amount at least equal to the sum of the membership stock purchase requirement, determined on an annual basis at the end of each calendar year, and the activity-based stock purchase requirement, determined on a daily basis. For Old National Bank, the membership stock purchase requirement is 1.0% of the Mortgage-Related Assets, as defined by the FHLBI, which consists principally of residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, held by Old National Bank. The activity-based stock purchase requirement is equal to the sum of: (1) a specified percentage ranging from 2.0% to 5.0%, which for Old National Bank is 5.0%, of outstanding borrowings from the FHLBI&#59; (2) a specified percentage ranging from 0.0% to 5.0%, which for Old National Bank is 3.0%, of the outstanding principal balance of Acquired Member Assets, as defined by the FHLBI, and delivery commitments for Acquired Member Assets&#59; (3) a specified dollar amount related to certain off-balance sheet items, which for Old National Bank is inapplicable&#59; and (4) a specified percentage ranging from 0.0% to 5.0% of the carrying value on the FHLBI&#8217;s balance sheet of derivative contracts between the FHLBI and Old National Bank, which for Old National Bank is inapplicable. The FHLBI can adjust the specified percentages and dollar amount from time to time within the ranges established by the FHLBI capital plan. As of December 31, 2019, Old National Bank was in compliance with the minimum stock ownership requirement. 

Federal Reserve System. Federal Reserve regulations require depository institutions to maintain cash reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and demand deposit accounts). A reserve of 3% is to be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts between $12.4 million and $79.5 million (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve) plus a reserve of 10% (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve between 8% and 14%) against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of $79.5 million. The first $12.4 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve) is exempt from the reserve requirements. Old National Bank is in compliance with the foregoing requirements . 

Other Regulations. Old National Bank is subject to federal consumer protection statutes and regulations promulgated under those laws, including, but not limited to, the:

The Dodd-Frank Act also significantly impacts the various consumer protection laws, rules and regulations applicable to financial institutions. The statute rolls back the federal preemption of state consumer protection laws that was enjoyed by national banks by (1) requiring that a state consumer financial law prevent or significantly interfere with the exercise of a national bank&#8217;s powers before it can be preempted, (2) mandating that any preemption decision be made on a case by case basis rather than a blanket rule, and (3) ending the applicability of preemption to subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks. As a result, we may now be subject to state consumer protection laws in each state where we do business, and those laws may be interpreted and enforced differently in each state.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;), a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than $10 billion, like Old National, to carry out federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws. Any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the CFPB or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to Old National&#8217;s consumer-facing businesses. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair, deceptive , and abusive practices. 

The rules issued by the CFPB have impacted our mortgage loan origination and servicing activities. Compliance with these rules will likely continue to increase our overall regulatory compliance costs.

Dividend Limitation. Old National Bank is subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act, is supervised, regulated and examined by the OCC, and is subject to the rules and regulations of the OCC, Federal Reserve and the FDIC. A substantial portion of Old National&#8217;s cash revenue is derived from dividends paid to it by Old National Bank. These dividends are subject to various legal and regulatory restrictions as summarized in Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives. From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of Old National in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. Old National cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of Old National. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to Old National or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on Old National&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations.
