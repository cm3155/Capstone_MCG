&#160;

CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS IN FISCAL 2019

Old National spent 2019 internally focused. This included an analysis of each business, department, and function within the company. We partnered with a leading consulting firm with the ultimate goal of improving the overall efficiency of the organization while serving our clients better. Key performance indicators experienced in 2019 included:

&#160;

&#8226;

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

improved efficiency ratio of 60.35% in 2019, compared to 67.74% in 2018. 

##TABLE_END

During 2019, our net interest income increased to $604.3 million compared to $537.6 million in 2018, an increase of 12%. Noninterest income grew from $195.3 million in 2018 to $199.3 million in 2019 reflecting higher mortgage banking revenue and capital markets income. We also benefited from higher noninterest income attributable to a full year of Klein contribution as compared to 2018, which only reflected two months of the Klein operations. Our noninterest expenses were well controlled, declining from $517.3 million in 2018 to $508.5 million in 2019.

In January 2020, Old National commenced implementation of a strategic plan (&#8220;The ONB Way&#8221;), which has various detailed business objectives designed to keep the Company&#8217;s clients at the center of all we do. The ONB Way includes realigning the geographic organization structure to streamline our operating model through integrated commercial, community banking, and wealth teams. We have also identified revenue and efficiency opportunities across the organization. Another component of The ONB Way is the optimization of our branch network. This optimization, which includes 31 banking centers scattered throughout the footprint that will be consolidated in April 2020, reflects an ongoing shift among our clients toward digital banking solutions. Many of the facilities to be consolidated are in smaller markets, several of which were added in recent years through partnership activity. By state, these consolidations include ten banking centers in both Wisconsin and Indiana, five in Michigan, four in Minnesota, and two in Kentucky. The Company expects to incur an estimated $25 million in costs associated with the branch optimization. In addition, Old National plans to close several non-branch facilities at a later date and incur related miscellaneous charges of approximately $8 million. 

BUSINESS OUTLOOK

In 2019, the U.S. economy grew by approximately 2.3% as measured by the change in GDP. While the growth rate was slower than the rate in 2018, the general consensus among leading economists is that the worst of the slowdown in economic growth has passed. Their outlook for 2020 is for the U.S. economy GDP growth of approximately 2%. The projected drivers of this growth are from consumer spending, which is dependent on personal income growth 

&#160;

and is expected to slow somewhat over the course of 2020, coupled with an offset of industrial production as its current decline is expected to bottom out in 2020 and bolster business investment. A strong start in residential housing is also expected to sustain U.S. economic growth over the coming quarters. An additional economic driver is the record-low unemployment. Potential threats to the expected fragile economic expansion include: increased personal debt that may choke off consumer spending, possible resurgence of a China trade dispute or foreign trade friction, energy price spikes, U.S. political infighting, and uncertainty in interest rates. Lastly, global geopolitical conflicts or natural disasters could also trigger a halt to the U.S. economic expansion. 

We remain a community bank at heart, dedicated to serving and strengthening our communities as we evolve into a regional bank structure. As Old National implements this strategic plan, our mission has also evolved. Our objective is to transform Old National into a commercially-oriented regional bank that consistently delivers top quartile performance to clients, team members, shareholders, and communities.

As Old National moves from a generalist relationship management approach, based on geography, to a specialist relationship management approach, based on business segmentations, the fundamentals of basic banking do not change. Those fundamentals are loan growth, non-interest income growth, prudent capital deployment, and expense management. 

Organic loan growth is a priority. Our loan production and pipeline are at high levels as we enter into 2020 and we are hopeful that the 2019 cycle of persistently high levels of prepayments has passed. Despite this, we continue to adhere to our disciplined underwriting process. Our practice of recognizing underperforming credits early, along with active engagement with these borrowers ultimately leads to lower credit losses. Credit quality remains strong, and we have not experienced any specific sector credit related weaknesses, yet are watching a small number of credits.

With the onset of The ONB Way, we have made investments in our non-interest income businesses, in technology and personnel. Accordingly, we are optimistic for continued expansion in 2020. 

Our acquisition strategy has not changed. We remain an active looker in our target markets and a highly selective, disciplined buyer. We wait patiently for the perfect pitch while we remain focused on execution.

As we look ahead to 2020, we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to similar measures that may be represented by other companies.

Comparison of Fiscal Years 2019 and 2018

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is the most significant component of our earnings, comprising 75% of 2019 revenues. Net interest income and margin are influenced by many factors, primarily the volume and mix of earning assets, funding sources, and interest rate fluctuations. Other factors include the level of accretion income on purchased loans, prepayment risk on mortgage and investment-related assets, and the composition and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

&#160;

The Federal Reserve lowered the discount rate by 75 basis points in the second half of 2019. At December 31, 2019, the Treasury yield curve was flat from the 3-month Treasury to the 5-year Treasury with a spread of 12 basis points. Continued flatness of the yield curve could cause our interest rate spread to decline, which may result in a decrease in our net interest income. However, management has taken balance sheet restructuring, derivative, and deposit pricing actions to help mitigate this risk.

&#160;

Loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities. Funding from client deposits generally costs less than wholesale funding sources. Factors such as general economic activity, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and price volatility of competing alternative investments, can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize the mix of assets and funding, net interest income, and margin.

&#160;

Net interest income is the excess of interest received from earning assets over interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. For analytical purposes, net interest income is also presented in the table that follows, adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to reflect what our tax-exempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same after-tax yield as a taxable asset. We used the federal statutory tax rate in effect of 21% for 2019 and 2018 and 35% for 2017 . This analysis portrays the income tax benefits related to tax-exempt assets and helps to facilitate a comparison between taxable and tax-exempt assets. Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Therefore, management believes these measures provide useful information for both management and investors by allowing them to make peer comparisons .

&#160;

Net interest income was $604.3 million in 2019, a $66.7 million increase from $537.6 million in 2018. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $617.2 million in 2019, a 12% increase from $549.0 million in 2018. The net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.55% in 2019, a 1 basis point increase compared to 3.54% in 2018. The increase in net interest income in 2019 when compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher average earning assets of $1.884 billion in 2019. Partially offsetting higher average earning assets were higher average interest-bearing liabilities of $1.398 billion. Net interest income in both 2019 and 2018 included accretion income (interest income in excess of contractual interest income) associated with acquired loans. Accretion income totaled $43.6 million in 2019, compared to $41.1 million in 2018. We expect accretion income on loans to decrease over time, but this may be offset by future acquisitions.

The yield on average earning assets in creased 1 3 basis points from 4.15 % in 2018 to 4.28 % in 2019 and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 15 basis points from 0. 81 % in 2018 to 0. 96 % in 201 9 . Average earning assets increased by $ 1.884 billion, or 1 2 %. The increase in average earning assets consisted of a $ 1.197 b illion increase in investment securities, a $ 668.0 m illion increase in loans, and a n $ 1 8.8 million in crease in money market and other interest-earning investments. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $1. 398 billion, or 1 2 %. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities consisted of a $ 1. 285 b illion increase in interest-bearing deposits, a $ 3.2 million increase in federal funds purchased and interbank borrowings, a $ 2.3 million de crease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase , a $ 1 10 . 3 million increase in FHLB advances, and a $ 1.4 million increase in other borrowings. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased by $ 230.2 million. 

The increase in average earning assets in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to our acquisition of Klein in November 2018. Including loans held for sale, the loan portfolio, which generally has an average yield higher than the investment portfolio, was approximately 70% of average interest earning assets in 2019 compared to 74% in 2018.

Average loans including loans held for sale increased $668.0 million in 2019 compared to 2018 reflecting loans acquired from Klein in November 2018, along with organic loan growth. Loans including loans held for sale attributable to the Klein acquisition totaled $1.052 billion as of the closing date of the acquisition, which was November 1, 2018. 

&#160;

Average investments increased $1.197 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 reflecting the Klein acquisition. Excess liquidity generated in 2019 also resulted in higher investment securities. 

Average non-interest-bearing deposits increased $230.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018 reflecting the Klein acquisition. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $1.285 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 reflecting the Klein acquisition.

Average borrowed funds increased $112.6 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in FHLB advances.

##TABLE_END

The variance not solely due to rate or volume is allocated equally between the rate and volume variances.

##TABLE_START (1) 

Interest on investment securities and loans includes the effect of taxable equivalent adjustments of $7.7 million and $5.2 million, respectively, in 2019&#59; $7.1 million and $4.3 million, respectively, in 2018&#59; and $15.6 million and $7.5 million, respectively, in 2017&#59; using the federal statutory tax rate in effect of 21% in 2019 and 2018 and 35% in 2017.

##TABLE_END

Provision for Loan Losses

The provision for loan losses was an expense of $4.7 million in 2019, compared to an expense of $7.0 million in 2018. Net charge-offs totaled $5.6 million in 2019, compared to net charge-offs of $1.9 million in 2018. The lower provision for loan losses is the result of a decrease in specific reserves on loans individually evaluated for impairment, partially offset by loan growth. Continued loan growth in future periods, a decline in our current level of recoveries, or an increase in charge-offs could result in an increase in provision expense. Additionally, with the adoption of CECL beginning on January 1, 2020, provision expense may become more volatile due to changes in CECL model assumptions of credit quality, macroeconomic factors and conditions, and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses balance. For additional information about non-performing loans, charge-offs, and additional items impacting the provision , refer to the &#8220;Risk Management &#8211; Credit Risk&#8221; section of Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

Noninterest Income

We generate revenues in the form of noninterest income through client fees, sales commissions, and other gains and losses from our core banking franchise and other related businesses, such as wealth management, investment consulting, and investment products. This source of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 25% in 2019 compared to 27% in 2018.

##TABLE_START (1) 

Total revenue includes the effect of a taxable equivalent adjustment of $12.9 million in 2019, $11.4 million in 2018, and $23.1 million in 2017.

##TABLE_END

The increase in noninterest income in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher mortgage banking revenue, higher capital markets income, and higher noninterest income attributable to the full year impact of the Klein partnership. These increases were partially offset by a $14.0 million gain on the sale of 10 Wisconsin branches in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Service charges and overdraft fees increased $0.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher service charges and overdraft fees attributable to the Klein partnership.

Debit card and ATM fees increased $1.4 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher interchange income attributable to the Klein partnership.

Mortgage banking revenue increased $9.0 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increased mortgage originations, sales, and strong pipeline growth in 2019.

Capital markets income is comprised of customer interest rate swap fees, debt placement fees, foreign currency exchange fees, and net gains (losses) on foreign currency adjustments. Capital markets income increased $8.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher customer interest rate swap fees.

Company-owned life insurance income increased $1.0 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher settlements in 2019.

In 2018, we recorded a net gain of $14.0 million in connection with the October 2018 divestiture of 10 Wisconsin branches, which included a deposit premium of $15.0 million, goodwill allocation of $0.6 million, and $0.4 million of other transaction expenses.

Other income decreased $3.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a $2.2 million gain on the sale of our student loan portfolio in the second quarter of 2018. Also contributing to the decrease in other income was the recognition of deferred gains on sale leaseback transactions of $1.6 million in 2018. The deferred gains were eliminated as a cumulative-effect adjustment upon adoption of the new accounting guidance in Topic 842 effective January 1, 2019. These decreases were partially offset by higher other income attributable to the Klein partnership.

##TABLE_END

Noninterest expense decreased $8.8 million in 2019 compared to 2018 reflecting a decrease in amortization of tax credit investments and lower charitable contributions. These decreases were partially offset by higher professional fees, higher salaries and employee benefits, and higher operating expenses and acquisition and integration costs associated with the full year impact of the Klein partnership .

Salaries and employee benefits is the largest component of noninterest expense. Salaries and benefits increased $8.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits attributable to the Klein partnership. 

&#160;

Equipment expenses increased $2.0 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher equipment expenses attributable to the Klein partnership and an increase in small equipment expenses . 

&#160;

Professional fees increased $8.4 million in 2019 compared to 2018 reflecting $10.3 million in consulting fees incurred in 2019 related to The ONB Way . 

&#160;

FDIC assessment expenses decreased $4.6 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the elimination of an FDIC surcharge.

Amortization of intangibles increased $2.5 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to amortization of core deposit intangibles related to the Klein acquisition.

Amortization of tax credit investments decreased $20.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The recognition of tax credit amortization expense is contingent upon the successful rehabilitation of a historic building or completion of a solar project within the reporting period. Many factors including weather, labor availability, building regulations, inspections, and other unexpected construction delays related to a rehabilitation project can cause a project to exceed its estimated completion date. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our tax credit investments.

Other expense decreased $9.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower charitable contributions of $7.7 million and writedowns on long-lived assets in 2018 related to branch consolidations.

Provision for Income Taxes

We record a provision for income taxes currently payable and for income taxes payable or benefits to be received in the future, which arise due to timing differences in the recognition of certain items for financial statement and income tax purposes. The major difference between the effective tax rate applied to our financial statement income and the federal statutory tax rate is caused by a tax benefit from our tax credit investments and interest on tax-exempt securities and loans. The effective tax rate was 18.0% in 2019 compared to 8.6% in 2018. The higher 

&#160;

effective tax rate in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily the result of a de crease in federal tax credits available as well as an increase in pre-tax book income . See Note 1 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on Old National&#8217;s income tax provision. 

Comparison of Fiscal Years 2018 and 2017

In 2018, we generated net income of $190.8 million and diluted net income per share of $1.22 compared to $95.7 million and diluted net income per share of $0.69, respectively, in 2017. The 2018 earnings included a $100.4 million increase in net interest income, a $55.1 million decrease in income tax expense, and an $11.9 million increase in noninterest income. These favorable variances in net income were partially offset by a $68.4 million increase in noninterest expense and a $3.9 million increase in provision for loan losses. The successful conversion and integration of our acquisition of our Klein partnership in 2018, the highest loan production in our history, and consistently low credit metrics, all contributed to positive 2018 performance when compared to 2017. 

Net interest income was $537.6 million in 2018, a $100.4 million increase from $437.2 million in 2017. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $549.0 million in 2018, a 19% increase from $460.3 million in 2017. The net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.54% in 2018, a 6 basis point increase compared to 3.48% in 2017. Average earning assets increased by $2.263 billion in 2018 and the yield on average earning assets increased 23 basis points from 3.92% in 2017 to 4.15% in 2018.

The provision for loan losses was an expense of $7.0 million in 2018, compared to an expense of $3.1 million in 2017. Charge-offs remained low during 2018 and we continued to see positive trends in credit quality.

Noninterest income increased $11.9 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a $14.0 million gain on the sale of 10 Wisconsin branches and higher noninterest income attributable to the Anchor (MN) and Klein partnerships. This increase was partially offset by lower net securities gains and 2017 recoveries on loans originated by AnchorBank (WI) that had been fully charged-off prior to the acquisition totaling $4.0 million. 

Noninterest expense increased $68.4 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher operating expenses and acquisition and integration costs associated with Anchor (MN) and Klein . Also contributing to the increase in noninterest expense was higher a mortization of tax credit investments in 2018 reflecting the completion of investment tax credit projects, higher salaries and benefits, and higher charitable contributions .

The provision for income taxes was $17.9 million in 2018 compared to $72.9 million in 2017. Old National&#8217;s effective tax rate was 8.6% in 2018 compared to 43.3% in 2017. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 is the result of $39.3 million of additional tax expense recorded in 2017 for the revaluation of deferred tax assets due to the lowering of the federal corporate tax rate to 21% and an increase in federal tax credits available. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

At December 31, 2019, our assets were $20.412 billion, a 3% increase compared to $19.728 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due an increase in investment securities.

Earning Assets

Our earning assets are comprised of investment securities, portfolio loans, loans held for sale, money market investments, interest earning accounts with the Federal Reserve, and equity securities. Earning assets were $17.762 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of 4% compared to $17.070 billion at December 31, 2018.

Investment Securities

We classify the majority of our investment securities as available-for-sale to give management the flexibility to sell the securities prior to maturity if needed, based on fluctuating interest rates or changes in our funding requirements. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we inadvertently sold six held-to-maturity classified municipal bond investment securities valued at $9.7 million for a gain of $0.3 million. After the trade settled, we determined the sale of the held-to-maturity investment securities was not one of the permissible sale exceptions afforded by the current accounting guidance. Accordingly, we reclassified the entire held-to-maturity portfolio totaling $382.0 million into our available-for-sale portfolio, which increased capital by $19.4 million. Additionally, management does not 

&#160;

expect to use the held-to-maturity category for at least the next two years . This action provides increased liquidity , which enables Old National to mitigate interest rate risk differently, but just as effectively, as the held-to-maturity category provided Old National . 

Equity securities are recorded at fair value and totaled $6.8 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $5.6 million at December 31, 2018.

At December 31, 2019, the investment securities portfolio, including equity securities, was $5.556 billion compared to $4.778 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $777.7 million, or 16%. Investment securities represented 31% of earning assets at December 31, 2019, compared to 28% at December 31, 2018. Excess liquidity generated in 2019 resulted in a higher percentage of investment securities compared to December 31, 2018. Stronger commercial loan demand in the future could result in management&#8217;s decision to reduce the securities portfolio. As of December 31, 2019, management does not intend to sell any securities in an unrealized loss position and does not believe we will be required to sell such securities.

The investment securities available-for-sale portfolio had net unrealized gains of $71.9 million at December 31, 2019, compared to net unrealized losses of $49.2 million at December 31, 2018. Net unrealized gains (losses) increased from December 31 , 2018 to December 31, 2019 reflecting higher net unrealized gains on mortgage-backed securities and state and political subdivision securities due to a decline in long-term interest rates. The increase in net unrealized gains also reflected the reclassification of the held-to-maturity portfolio, which included a net unrealized gain of $19.4 million.

The investment securities available-for-sale portfolio had an effective duration of 3.86 at December 31, 2019, compared to 4.00 at December 31, 2018. Effective duration measures the percentage change in value of the portfolio in response to a change in interest rates. Generally, there is more uncertainty in interest rates over a longer average maturity, resulting in a higher duration percentage . The weighted average yields on investment securities were 2.89% in 2019 and 2.83% in 2018.

At December 31, 2019, Old National had a concentration of investment securities issued by certain states and their political subdivisions with the following aggregate market values: $400.2 million by Indiana, which represented 14.0% of shareholders&#8217; equity, and $165.7 million by Texas, which represented 5.8% of shareholders&#8217; equity. Of the Indiana municipal bonds, 99% are rated &#8220;A&#8221; or better, and the remaining 1% generally represent non-rated local interest bonds where Old National has a market presence. All of the Texas municipal bonds are rated &#8220;A&#8221; or better, and the majority of issues are backed by the &#8220;AAA&#8221; rated State of Texas Permanent School Fund Guarantee Program.

Loan Portfolio

We lend primarily to consumers and small to medium-sized commercial and commercial real estate clients in various industries including manufacturing, agribusiness, transportation, mining, wholesaling, and retailing. Our policy is to concentrate our lending activity in the geographic market areas we serve, primarily Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.

The following table presents the composition of the loan portfolio at December 31.

Residential Real Estate Loans

Residential real estate loans, primarily 1-4 family properties, increased $85.9 million, or 4%, at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. Future increases in interest rates could result in a decline in the level of refinancings and new originations of residential real estate loans.

Consumer Loans

Consumer loans, including automobile loans and personal and home equity loans and lines of credit, decreased $77.5 million, or 4%, at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. We continue to see runoff in our less profitable indirect consumer loan portfolio.

Allowance for Loan Losses

To provide for the risk of loss inherent in extending credit, we maintain an allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses incurred in the consolidated loan portfolio. Management&#8217;s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans, pools of homogeneous loans, assessments of the impact of current and anticipated economic conditions on the portfolio, and historical loss experience. Additional information about our Allowance for Loan Losses is included in the &#8220;Risk Management &#8211; Credit Risk&#8221; section of Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements. 

At December 31, 2019, the allowance for loan losses was $54.6 million, a decrease of $0.9 million compared to $55.5 million at December 31, 2018. Continued loan growth in future periods, a decline in our current level of recoveries, or an increase in charge-offs could result in an increase in provision expense. Additionally, with the adoption of CECL beginning on January 1, 2020, provision expense may become more volatile due to changes in CECL model assumptions of credit quality, macroeconomic factors and conditions, and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses balance. As a percentage of total loans excluding loans held for sale, the allowance was 0.45% at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The provision for loan losses was an expense of $4.7 million in 2019 compared to an expense of $7.0 million in 2018. 

For commercial loans, the allowance for loan losses increased by $0.8 million at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of the commercial loan portfolio increased to 0.78% at December 31, 2019, from 0.67% at December 31, 2018.

&#160;

For commercial real estate loans, the allowance for loan losses de creased by $ 1.9 million at December 31, 201 9 compared to December 31, 201 8 . The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of the commercial real estate loan portfolio decreased to 0. 4 2 % at December 31, 201 9 , from 0 . 4 7 % at December 31, 201 8 . 

The allowance for loan losses for residential real estate loans as a percentage of that portfolio was 0.10% at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses for consumer loans as a percentage of that portfolio increased to 0.47% at December 31, 2019, from 0.44% at December 31, 2018.

&#160;

Old National will adopt ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) effective January 1, 2020. The main objective of this amendment is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The amendment requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to enhance their credit loss estimates. Old National expects to recognize a one-time cumulative effect adjustment increasing the allowance for loan losses. Because we do not have final approval from our oversight and governance committees, we are estimating an increase to the allowance for credit losses of approximately $35 million to $45 million upon adoption, which includes a range of $3 million to $8 million for off-balance sheet exposures. The vast majority of this increase is related to the acquired loan portfolio. Under the current accounting guidance, any remaining unamortized loan discount on an individual loan can be used to offset a charge-off for that loan, so the allowance for loan losses needed for the acquired loans is reduced by the remaining loan discounts. The new accounting under the ASU removes the ability to offset a charge-off against the remaining loan discount and requires an allowance for credit losses to be recognized in addition to the loan discount. The ultimate impact of adopting the ASU, and at each subsequent reporting period, is highly dependent on credit quality, macroeconomic forecasts and conditions, composition of our loans and available-for-sale securities portfolio, along with other management judgements. The transition adjustment to record the allowance for credit losses may fall outside of management&#8217;s estimated increase based on material changes in these dependencies, specifically the macroeconomic forecast and conditions and loan composition, used in calculating the allowance for credit losses upon the adoption of CECL. 

&#160;

Old National does not expect a material allowance for credit losses to be recorded on its available-for-sale debt securities under the newly codified available-for-sale debt security impairment model, as the majority of these securities are government agency-backed securities for which the risk of loss is minimal . See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Company&#8217;s adoption of CECL.

Allowance for Losses on Unfunded Commitments

We maintain an allowance for losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for loan losses, modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment. This allowance is classified as a liability on the balance sheet within accrued expenses and other liabilities, while the corresponding provision for these loan losses is recorded as a component of other expense. The allowance for losses on unfunded commitments was $2.7 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $2.5 million at December 31, 2018.

Loans Held for Sale

Mortgage loans held for immediate sale in the secondary market were $46.9 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $14.9 million at December 31, 2018. Certain mortgage loans are committed for sale at or prior to origination at a contracted price to an outside investor. Other mortgage loans held for immediate sale are hedged with TBA forward agreements and committed for sale when they are ready for delivery and remain on the Company&#8217;s balance sheet for a short period of time (typically 30 to 60 days). These loans are sold without recourse, beyond customary representations and warranties, and Old National has not experienced material losses arising from these sales. Mortgage originations are subject to volatility due to interest rates and home sales, among other factors.

We have elected the fair value option prospectively for residential loans held for sale. The aggregate fair value exceeded the unpaid principal balance by $1.5 million at December 31, 2019 and $0.5 million at December 31, 2018. 

&#160;

Operating Lease Right-of-Use Assets 

&#160;

Old National adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2019, which required the recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets. Operating lease right-of-use assets represent the lessee&#8217;s right to use, or control the use of, specified assets for the lease term. Operating lease right-of-use assets are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease right-of-use assets totaled $95.5 million at December 31, 2019. 

Net Deferred Tax Assets

Net deferred tax assets decreased $57.3 million since December 31, 2018 primarily due to decreases in net deferred tax assets related to net unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale investment securities, acquired loans, and net operating loss carryforwards. Future changes in the corporate tax rate could result in a change in value of Old National&#8217;s deferred tax assets and future income tax expense. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Funding

Total funding, comprised of deposits and wholesale borrowings, was $17.298 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $454.4 million from $16.844 billion at December 31, 2018. Total deposits were $14.553 billion, including $12.871 billion in transaction accounts and $1.682 billion in time deposits at December 31, 2019. Total deposits increased $203.4 million, compared to December 31, 2018. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $76.9 million from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Interest-bearing checking and NOW deposits increased $361.3 million from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019, while savings deposits decreased $98.7 million. Money market deposits increased $205.9 million from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019, while time deposits decreased $342.0 million.

We use wholesale funding to augment deposit funding and to help maintain our desired interest rate risk position. At December 31, 2019, w holesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and interbank borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances, and other borrowings, totaled $2.745 billion, an increase of $250.9 million, or 10%, from December 31, 2018. The increase in wholesale funding from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in FHLB advances and federal funds purchased and interbank borrowings. W holesale funding as a percentage of total funding was 16% at December 31, 2019, compared to 15% at December 31, 2018. See Notes 13, 14, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our financing activities. 

The following table details the average balances of all funding sources for the years ended December 31.

The adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2019 also required the recognition of operating lease liabilities. Operating lease liabilities represent a lessee&#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis. Operating lease liabilities totaled $99.5 million at December 31, 2019. 

&#160;

Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities

Accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased $33.5 million, or 17%, from December 31, 2018 primarily due to decreases in unfunded commitments on various tax credit investments and lower accrued expenses related to the Klein acquisition .

Capital

Shareholders&#8217; equity totaled $2.852 billion, or 14% of total assets, at December 31, 2019 and $2.690 billion, or 14% of total assets, at December 31, 2018. The change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investment securities increased equity by $93.5 million during 2019. Old National repurchased 6.0 million shares of Common Stock in 2019 under a stock repurchase plan that was approved by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, which reduced equity by $99.1 million. We also paid cash dividends of $0.52 per share in 2019 , which reduced equity by $89.5 million. Old National&#8217;s Common Stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol &#8220;ONB&#8221; with 37 ,328 shareholders of record at December 31, 2019.

Capital Adequacy 

Old National and the banking industry are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Management routinely analyzes Old National&#8217;s capital to ensure an optimized capital structure. Accordingly, such evaluations may result in Old National taking a capital action. For additional information on capital adequacy see Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements. 

RISK MANAGEMENT

Overview

Old National has adopted a Risk Appetite Statement to enable the Board of Directors, Executive Leadership Group, and Senior Management to better assess, understand, and mitigate the risks of Old National. The Risk Appetite Statement addresses the following major risks: strategic, market, liquidity, credit, operational/technology/cyber, regulatory/compliance/legal, reputational, and human resources. Our Chief Risk Officer is independent of management and reports directly to the Chair of the Board&#8217;s Enterprise Risk Management Committee. The following discussion addresses these major risks: credit, market, liquidity, operational/technology/cyber, and regulatory/compliance/legal.

Credit Risk

Credit risk represents the risk of loss arising from an obligor&#8217;s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Our primary credit risks result from our investment and lending activities.

&#160;

Investment Activities 

We carry a higher exposure to loss in our pooled trust preferred securities, which are collateralized debt obligations, due to illiquidity in that market and the performance of the underlying collateral. At December 31, 2019, we had pooled trust preferred securities with a fair value of $8.2 million, or less than 1% of the available-for-sale securities portfolio. These securities remained classified as available-for-sale and at December 31, 2019, the unrealized loss on our pooled trust preferred securities was $5.6 million. The fair value of these securities should improve as we get closer to maturity, but not in all cases. There was no OTTI recorded in 2019 or 2018 . 

All of our mortgage-backed securities are backed by U.S. government-sponsored or federal agencies. Municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and other debt securities are evaluated by reviewing the credit-worthiness of the issuer and general market conditions. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details about our investment security portfolio.

Counterparty Exposure 

Counterparty exposure is the risk that the other party in a financial transaction will not fulfill its obligation. We define counterparty exposure as nonperformance risk in transactions involving federal funds sold and purchased, repurchase agreements, correspondent bank relationships, and derivative contracts with companies in the financial services industry. Old National manages exposure to counterparty risk in connection with its derivatives transactions by generally engaging in transactions with counterparties having ratings of at least A by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Rating Service or A2 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. Total credit exposure is monitored by counterparty and managed within limits that management believes to be prudent. Old National&#8217;s net counterparty exposure was a liability of $6.1 million at December 31, 2019.

Lending Activities 

Commercial 

Commercial and industrial loans are made primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital, and other general business purposes. Lease financing consists of direct financing leases and are used by commercial customers to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment. The credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant. A determination is made as to the applicant&#8217;s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved. In addition to an evaluation of the applicant&#8217;s financial condition, a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment, such as additional collateral or personal guarantees, to be relied upon in the transaction. Credit agency reports of the applicant&#8217;s credit history supplement the analysis of the applicant&#8217;s creditworthiness.

Commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors, developers, and builders primarily domiciled in the geographic market areas we serve: Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. These loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate at LTV margins deemed appropriate for the property type, quality, location, and sponsorship. Generally, these LTV ratios do not exceed 80%. The commercial properties are predominantly non-residential properties such as retail centers, industrial properties and, to a lesser extent, more specialized properties. Substantially all of our commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area.

In the underwriting of our commercial real estate loans, we obtain appraisals for the underlying properties. Decisions to lend are based on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan, we primarily emphasize the ratio of the property&#8217;s projected net cash flows to the loan&#8217;s debt service requirement. The debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than 120% and it is computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate. In addition, a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is often required from the principal(s) of the borrower. In most cases, we require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien, fire, and extended coverage casualty insurance, and flood insurance, if appropriate, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property. In addition, business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required.

Construction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income, business income from an owner-occupant, or the sale of the property to an end-user. We may mitigate the risks associated with these types 

&#160;

of loans by requiring fixed-price construction contracts, performance and payment bonding, controlled disbursements, and pre-sale contracts or pre-lease agreements . 

Consumer 

&#160;

We offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets, with residential home mortgages comprising our largest consumer loan category. These loans are secured by a primary residence and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks of the consumer. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, DTI ratios, liquidity, and credit scores. A maximum LTV ratio of 80% is generally required, although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance or other mitigating factors. We offer fixed rate mortgages and variable rate mortgages with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first, third, fifth, or seventh year, depending on the product and are based on fully-indexed rates such as LIBOR. We do not offer payment-option facilities, sub-prime loans, or any product with negative amortization.

&#160;

Home equity loans are secured primarily by second mortgages on residential property of the borrower. The underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permit borrowing availability, in the aggregate, up to 90% of the appraised value of the collateral property at the time of origination. We offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans, with variable rate loans underwritten at fully-indexed rates. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, DTI ratios, and credit scores. We do not offer home equity loan products with reduced documentation.

&#160;

Automobile loans include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles. We originate automobile loans and leases primarily on an indirect basis through selected dealerships. We require borrowers to maintain collision insurance on automobiles securing consumer loans, with us listed as loss payee. Our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicant&#8217;s overall financial capacity, including credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although an applicant&#8217;s creditworthiness is the primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount.

&#160;

Asset Quality 

&#160;

Community-based lending personnel, along with region-based independent underwriting and analytic support staff, extend credit under guidelines established and administered by our Enterprise Risk Committee. This committee, which meets quarterly, is made up of outside directors. The committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies, credit exposures, peer comparisons, problem loans, and charge-offs. In addition, the committee reviews and approves recommended loan policy changes to assure it remains appropriate for the current lending environment.

&#160;

We lend to commercial and commercial real estate clients in various industries including manufacturing, agribusiness, transportation, mining, wholesaling, and retailing. Old National manages concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship, and loan size. At December 31, 2019, our average commercial loan size was under $300,000 and our average commercial real estate loan size was under $675,000. In addition, while loans to lessors of both residential and non-residential real estate exceed 10% of total loans, no individual sub-segment category within those broader categories reaches the 10% threshold. At December 31, 2019, we had minimal exposure to foreign borrowers and no sovereign debt. Our policy is to concentrate our lending activity in the geographic market areas we serve, primarily Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. We are experiencing a slow and gradual improvement in the economy of our principal markets. Management expects that trends in under-performing, criticized, and classified loans will be influenced by the degree to which the economy strengthens or weakens.

##TABLE_START (1) 

Old National entered into separate loss sharing agreements with the FDIC providing for specified credit loss protection for substantially all acquired single family residential loans, commercial loans, and other real estate owned. On June 22, 2016, Old National entered into an early termination agreement with the FDIC that terminated all loss share agreements. Old National reclassified all covered assets to noncovered assets effective June 22, 2016.

Includes purchased credit impaired loans of $7.9 million, $20.5 million, $12.6 million, $16.7 million, and $15.9 million for 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, that are categorized as nonaccrual for credit analysis purposes because the collection of principal or interest is doubtful. However, these loans are accounted for under FASB ASC 310-30 and accordingly treated as performing assets.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (3)

Because the acquired loans were recorded at fair value in accordance with ASC 805 at the date of acquisition, the credit risk is incorporated in the fair value recorded. No allowance for loan losses is recorded on the acquisition date.

Under-performing assets totaled $147.5 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $179.4 million at December 31, 2018. Under-performing assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate owned at December 31, 2019 were 1.22%, a 25 basis point improvement from 1.47% at December 31, 2018.

Nonaccrual loans decreased $31.1 million from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in nonaccrual commercial real estate loans. As a percentage of nonaccrual loans, the allowance for loan losses was 43.21% at December 31, 2019, compared to 35.22% at December 31, 2018. PCI loans that were included in the nonaccrual category because the collection of principal or interest is doubtful totaled $7.9 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $20.5 million at December 31, 2018. However, they are accounted for under FASB ASC 310-30 and accordingly treated as performing assets.

&#160;

If nonaccrual and renegotiated loans outstanding at December 31, 201 9 and 201 8 , respectively, had been accruing interest throughout the year in accordance with their original terms , i nterest income of approximately $ 4.4 million in 2019 and $ 5. 6 million in 2018 would have been recorded on these loans . Excluding PCI loans, t he amount of interest income actually recorded on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans was $ 2.8 million in 201 9 and 201 8 . We had $ 13.8 million of renegotiated loans included in nona c crual loans at December 31, 201 9 , compared to $ 26. 3 million at December 31, 201 8 . 

Total criticized and classified assets were $534.4 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $41.9 million from December 31, 2018. Other classified assets include investment securities that fell below investment grade rating totaling $2.9 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $2.8 million at December 31, 2018 . 

Old National may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans. The decision to restructure a loan, versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan, may benefit Old National by increasing the ultimate probability of collection.

Any loans that are modified are reviewed by Old National to identify if a TDR has occurred, which is when, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, Old National Bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status. The modification of the terms of such loans include one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan, an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate of new debt with similar risk, or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment of the loan.

Loans modified in a TDR are typically placed on nonaccrual status until we determine the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured, which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms for six months.

If we are unable to resolve a nonperforming loan issue, the credit will be charged off when it is apparent there will be a loss. For large commercial type loans, each relationship is individually analyzed for evidence of apparent loss based on quantitative benchmarks or subjectively based upon certain events or particular circumstances. Generally, Old National charges off small commercial loans scored through our small business credit center with contractual balances under $250,000 that are 90 days or more delinquent and do not have adequate collateral support. For residential and consumer loans, a charge off is recorded at the time foreclosure is initiated or when the loan becomes 120 to 180 days past due, whichever is earlier.

For commercial TDRs, an allocated reserve is established within the allowance for loan losses for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and its computed value. To determine the value of the loan, one of the following methods is selected: (1) the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s original effective interest rate, (2) the loan&#8217;s observable market price, or (3) the fair value of the collateral value, if the loan is collateral dependent. The allocated reserve is established as the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the collectable value. If there are significant changes in the amount or timing of the loan&#8217;s expected future cash flows, impairment is recalculated and the valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly.

When a residential or consumer loan is identified as a TDR, the loan is typically written down to its collateral value less selling costs.

At December 31, 2019, our TDRs consisted of $14.8 million of commercial loans, $12.4 million of commercial real estate loans, $3.0 million of residential loans, and $1.5 million of consumer loans totaling $31.7 million. Approximately $13.8 million of the TDRs at December 31, 2019 were included with nonaccrual loans. At December 31, 2018, our TDRs consisted of $10.3 million of commercial loans, $27.6 million of commercial real estate loans, $3.4 million of residential loans, and $2.4 million of consumer loans totaling $43.7 million. Approximately $26.3 million of the TDRs at December 31, 2018 were included with nonaccrual loans.

Old National has allocated specific reserves to customers whose loan terms have been modified in TDRs totaling $0.9 million at December 31, 2019 and $3.0 million at December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, Old National had committed to lend an additional $2.3 million to customers with outstanding loans that are classified as TDRs, compared to $4.4 million at December 31, 2018.

&#160;

The terms of certain other loans were modified during 2019 and 2018 that did not meet the definition of a TDR. It is our process to review all classified and criticized loans that, during the period, have been renewed, have entered into a forbearance agreement, have gone from principal and interest to interest only, or have extended the maturity date. In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. The evaluation is performed under our internal underwriting policy. We also evaluate whether a concession has been granted or if we were adequately compensated through a market interest rate, additional collateral, or a bona fide guarantee. We also consider whether the modification was insignificant relative to the other terms of the agreement or the delay in a payment. 

PCI loans are not considered impaired until after the point at which there has been a degradation of cash flows below our expected cash flows at acquisition. If a PCI loan is subsequently modified, and meets the definition of a TDR, it will be removed from PCI accounting and accounted for as a TDR only if the PCI loan was being accounted for individually. If the PCI loan is being accounted for as part of a pool, it will not be removed from the pool. At December 31, 2019, it has not been necessary to remove any loans from PCI accounting.

In general, once a modified loan is considered a TDR, the loan will always be considered a TDR, and therefore impaired, until it is paid in full, otherwise settled, sold, or charged off. However, guidance also permits for loans to be removed from TDR status when subsequently restructured under these circumstances: (1) at the time of the subsequent restructuring, the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulties, and this is documented by a current credit evaluation at the time of the restructuring, (2) under the terms of the subsequent restructuring agreement, the institution has granted no concession to the borrower&#59; and (3) the subsequent restructuring agreement includes market terms that are no less favorable than those that would be offered for a comparable new loan. For loans subsequently restructured that have cumulative principal forgiveness, the loan should continue to be measured in accordance with ASC 310-10, Receivables &#8211; Overall . However, consistent with ASC 310-40-50-2, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, Creditor Disclosure of Troubled Debt Restructurings , the loan would not be required to be reported in the years following the restructuring if the subsequent restructuring meets both of these criteria: (1) has an interest rate at the time of the subsequent restructuring that is not less than a market interest rate&#59; and (2) is performing in compliance with its modified terms after the subsequent restructuring.

To provide for the risk of loss inherent in extending credit, we maintain an allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses incurred in the consolidated loan portfolio. Management&#8217;s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans, pools of homogeneous loans, assessments of the impact of current and anticipated economic conditions on the portfolio, and historical loss experience .

The activity in our allowance for loan losses was as follows:

The allowance for loan losses decreased $0.8 million from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Net charge-offs totaled $5.6 million in 2019 compared to net charge-offs of $1.9 million in 2018. There were no industry segments representing a significant share of total net charge-offs. Net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans was 0.05% in 2019 compared to 0.02% in 2018. Over the last twelve months, net charge-offs have remained low. Continued loan growth in future periods, a decline in our current level of recoveries, or an increase in charge-offs could result in an increase in provision expense.

As a percentage of total loans, the allowance ranged from 0.45% to 0.75% for the last five years, and was 0.45% at December 31, 2019. Our ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans remained the same as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018.

The following table provides additional details of the components of the allowance for loan losses, including ASC 450, Contingencies , for loans collectively evaluated for impairment, ASC 310-10, Receivables , for loans individually evaluated for impairment, and ASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality , for loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality:

We maintain an allowance for losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that 

&#160;

used to determine the allowance for loan losses, modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment. The reserve for unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet and totaled $ 2. 7 million at December 31, 201 9 , compared to $ 2.5 million at December 31, 201 8 . 

The following table details the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the percent of loans in each category compared to total loans at December 31.

Market Risk

&#160;

Market risk is the risk that the estimated fair value of our assets, liabilities, and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility, or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes.

&#160;

The objective of our interest rate management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.

&#160;

Potential cash flows, sales, or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities, especially those that earn or pay interest, are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. This interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, customer preferences, historical pricing relationships, and re-pricing characteristics of financial instruments. Our earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve.

&#160;

In managing interest rate risk, we, through the Funds Management Committee, a committee of the Board of Directors, establish guidelines, for asset and liability management, including measurement of short and long-term sensitivities to changes in interest rates. Based on the results of our analysis, we may use different techniques to manage changing trends in interest rates including:

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

adjusting balance sheet mix or altering interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities&#59; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

changing product pricing strategies&#59; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio&#59; or 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

using derivative financial instruments, to a limited degree. 

##TABLE_END

&#160;

A key element in our ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a model to quantify the impact of changing interest rates on Old National. The model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income. The model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario. The base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are held at current levels. The model shows our projected net interest income sensitivity based on interest rate changes only and does not consider other forecast assumptions.

&#160;

The following table illustrates our projected net interest income sensitivity over a two-year cumulative horizon based on the asset/liability model as of December 31, 201 9 and 201 8 :

##TABLE_END

&#160;

Our asset sensitivity increased year over year primarily due to changes in our hedging strategies, balance sheet mix, investment duration, and prepayment speed behavior.

A key element in the measurement and modeling of interest rate risk is the re-pricing assumptions of our transaction deposit accounts, which have no contractual maturity dates. Because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income, we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results. For this reason, we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes, including shocks, ramps, yield curve flattening, yield curve steepening, as well as forecasts of likely interest rate scenarios tested. At December 31, 2019, our projected net interest income sensitivity based on the asset/liability models we utilize was within the limits of our interest rate risk policy for the scenarios tested.

We use derivative instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, collars, and floor spreads, to mitigate interest rate risk, including certain cash flow hedges on variable-rate assets and liabilities with a notional amount of $535 million at December 31, 2019. Our derivatives had an estimated fair value gain of $38.9 million at December 31, 2019, compared to an estimated fair value gain of $16.5 million at December 31, 2018. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments.

Liquidity Risk

&#160;

Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments, or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources. The Funds Management Committee of the Board of 

&#160;

Directors establishes liquidity risk guidelines and, along with the Balance Sheet Management Committee, monitors liquidity risk. The objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner. Management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities, funding sources, and loan and deposit forecasts. We maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth, properly manage capital markets&#8217; funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements. 

Loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds. However, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, the housing market, general and local economic conditions, and competition in the marketplace. We continually monitor marketplace trends to identify patterns that might improve the predictability of the timing of deposit flows or asset prepayments.

A time deposit maturity schedule for Old National Bank is shown in the following table at December 31, 2019.

Old National Bancorp has routine funding requirements consisting primarily of operating expenses, dividends to shareholders, debt service, net derivative cash flows, and funds used for acquisitions. Old National Bancorp can obtain funding to meet its obligations from dividends and management fees collected from its subsidiaries, operating line of credit, and through the issuance of debt securities. Additionally, Old National Bancorp has a shelf registration in place with the SEC permitting ready access to the public debt and equity markets. At December 31, 2019, Old National Bancorp&#8217;s other borrowings outstanding were $223.8 million.

Federal banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by banking subsidiaries without prior approval. Prior regulatory approval is required if dividends to be declared in any year would exceed net earnings of the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two years. Prior regulatory approval to pay dividends was not required in 2018 or 2019 and is not currently required.

Operational/Technology/Cyber Risk

Operational/technology/cyber risk is the potential that inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, information security breaches, fraud, or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses. We maintain frameworks, programs, and internal controls to prevent or minimize financial loss from failure of systems, people, or processes. This includes specific programs and frameworks intended to prevent or limit the effects of cyber risks including cyber-attacks or other information security breaches that might allow unauthorized transactions or unauthorized access to customer, associate, or company sensitive information. Metrics and measurements are used by Executive Leaders in the management of day-to-day operations to ensure effective customer service, minimization of service disruptions, and oversight of operational and cyber risk. We continually monitor and report on operational, technology, and cyber risks related to clients, products, and business practices&#59; external and internal fraud&#59; business disruptions and systems failures&#59; cyber-attacks, information security or data breaches&#59; damage to physical assets&#59; and execution, delivery, and process management.

The Enterprise Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight, guidance, and monitoring of risks, including operational/technology/cyber risks, being taken by the Company. The monitoring is accomplished through on-going review of management reports, data on risks, policy limits and discussion on enterprise risk management strategies, policies, and risk assessments.

Regulatory/Compliance/Legal Risk

Regulatory/compliance/legal risk is the risk that the Company violated or was not in compliance with applicable laws, regulations or practices, industry standards, or ethical standards. The legal portion assesses the risk that unenforceable contracts, lawsuits, or adverse judgments can disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the Company. The Board of Directors expects we will perform business in a manner compliant with applicable laws and/or regulations and expects issues to be identified, analyzed, and remediated in a timely and complete manner.

&#160;

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees. Commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees are used to meet the financial needs of our customers. Our banking affiliates have entered into various agreements to extend credit, including loan commitments of $2.779 billion and standby letters of credit of $87.8 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, approximately $2.545 billion of the loan commitments had fixed rates and $234.5 million had floating rates, with the floating interest rates ranging from 1% to 15%. At December 31, 2018, loan commitments were $3.566 billion and standby letters of credit of $319.0 million. The term of these off-balance sheet arrangements is typically one year or less.

Old National is a party in risk participation transactions of interest rate swaps, which had total notional amount of $37.0 million at December 31, 2019.

We rent certain premises and equipment under operating leases. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term lease arrangements.

We are party to various derivative contracts as a means to manage the balance sheet and our related exposure to changes in interest rates, to manage our residential real estate loan origination and sale activity, and to provide derivative contracts to our clients. Since the derivative liabilities recorded on the balance sheet change frequently and do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts, these liabilities are not included in the table of contractual obligations presented above. Further discussion of derivative instruments is included in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.

In the normal course of business, various legal actions and proceedings are pending against us and our affiliates which are incidental to the business in which they are engaged. Further discussion of contingent liabilities is included in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements. 

In addition, liabilities recorded under FASB ASC 740-10 (FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes &#8211; an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ) are not included in the table because the amount and timing of any cash payments cannot be reasonably estimated. Further discussion of income taxes and liabilities is included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.

&#160;

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Certain accounting policies require management to use significant judgment and estimates, which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. We consider these policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgment and assumptions made are based upon historical experience or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions, actual results could differ from estimates, which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

The following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant judgments and estimates. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our Audit Committee.

Goodwill

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Description. For acquisitions, we are required to record the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and the liabilities assumed at their fair value. These often involve estimates based on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition, inflation, asset growth rates, or other relevant factors. Goodwill recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Judgments and Uncertainties. The determination of fair values is based on valuations using management&#8217;s assumptions of future growth rates, future attrition, discount rates, multiples of earnings or other relevant factors. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions. Changes in these factors, as well as downturns in economic or business conditions, could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of goodwill and could result in impairment losses affecting our financials as a whole and our banking subsidiary in which the goodwill resides. 

##TABLE_END

Allowance for Loan Losses

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Description. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable incurred losses in the consolidated loan portfolio. Management&#8217;s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans, pools of homogeneous loans, assessments of the impact of current and anticipated economic conditions on the portfolio, and historical loss experience. The allowance represents management&#8217;s best estimate, but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance. Likewise, an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance. In either instance, unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations. 

##TABLE_END

The allowance is increased through a provision charged to operating expense. Uncollectible loans are charged-off through the allowance. Recoveries of loans previously charged-off are added to the allowance. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that contractual interest and principal payments will not be collected either for the amounts or by the dates as scheduled in the loan agreement. Our policy for recognizing income on impaired loans is to accrue interest unless a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. A loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest becomes 90 days past due unless it is well secured and in the process of collection, or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collectability of principal or interest. We monitor the quality of our loan portfolio on an on-going basis and use a combination of detailed credit assessments by relationship managers and credit officers, historic loss trends, and economic and business environment factors in determining the allowance for loan losses. We record provisions for loan losses based on current loans outstanding, grade changes, mix of loans, and expected losses. A detailed loan loss evaluation on an individual loan basis for our highest risk loans is performed quarterly. Management follows the progress of the economy and how it might affect our borrowers in both the near and the intermediate term. We have a formalized and disciplined independent loan review program to evaluate loan administration, credit quality, and compliance with corporate loan 

&#160;

standards. This program includes periodic, regular reviews of problem loan reports, delinquencies and charge-offs . 

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Judgments and Uncertainties. We utilize a PD/LGD model as a tool to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for performing commercial and commercial real estate loans. The PD is forecast using a transition matrix to determine the likelihood of a customer&#8217;s AQR migrating from its current AQR to any other status within the time horizon. Transition rates are measured using Old National&#8217;s own historical experience. The model assumes that recent historical transition rates will continue into the future. The LGD is defined as credit loss incurred when an obligor of the bank defaults. The sum of all net charge-offs for a particular portfolio segment are divided by all loans that have defaulted over a given period of time. The expected loss derived from the model considers the PD, LGD, and exposure at default. Additionally, qualitative factors, such as changes in lending policies or procedures, and economic business conditions are also considered. 

##TABLE_END

We use h istoric loss ratios adjusted for economic conditions to determine the appropriate level of allowance for residential real estate and consumer loans. 

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions. The allowance represents management&#8217;s best estimate, but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance. Likewise, an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance. In either instance, unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations. 

##TABLE_END

Management&#8217;s analysis of probable losses in the portfolio at December 31, 2019 resulted in a range for allowance for loan losses of $19.1 million. The range pertains to general (FASB ASC 450, Contingencies ) reserves for both retail and performing commercial loans. Specific (FASB ASC 310, Receivables ) reserves do not have a range of probable loss. Due to the risks and uncertainty associated with the economy and our projection of loss rates inherent in the portfolio, we establish a range of probable outcomes (a high-end estimate and a low-end estimate) and evaluate our position within this range. The potential effect to net income based on our position in the range relative to the high and low endpoints is a decrease of $2.1 million and an increase of $12.3 million, respectively, after taking into account the tax effects. These sensitivities are hypothetical and may not represent actual results.

Derivative Financial Instruments

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Description. As part of our overall interest rate risk management, we use derivative instruments to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and market prices for financial instruments. The application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness, identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items. To the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective, changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income. Management believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in preparation of the financial statements. All of the derivative financial instruments we use have an active market and indications of fair value can be readily obtained. We are not using the &#8220;short-cut&#8221; method of accounting for any fair value derivatives. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Judgments and Uncertainties. The application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness, identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions. To the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective, changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income. However, if in the future the derivative financial instruments used by us no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment, all changes in fair value of the derivative would flow through the consolidated statements of income in other noninterest income, resulting in greater volatility in our earnings. 

##TABLE_END

&#160;

Income Taxes 

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Description. We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states, and the municipalities in which we operate. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. We review income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets quarterly&#59; and as new information becomes available, the balances are adjusted as appropriate. FASB ASC 740-10 (FIN 48) prescribes a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not, and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of our provision and related income tax assets and liabilities. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Judgments and Uncertainties. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review/adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates used are reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would result in a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. 

##TABLE_END

Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to it in this &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221;
