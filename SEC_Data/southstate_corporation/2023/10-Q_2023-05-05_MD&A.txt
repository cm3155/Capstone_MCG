Unless otherwise mentioned or unless the context requires otherwise, references to &#8220;SouthState,&#8221; the &#8220;Company&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or similar references mean SouthState Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. References to the &#8220;Bank&#8221; means SouthState Corporation&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, SouthState Bank, National Association, a national banking association. 

Overview 

&#8203; 

SouthState is a financial holding company headquartered in Winter Haven, Florida, and was incorporated under the laws of South Carolina in 1985. We provide a wide range of banking services and products to our customers through our Bank. The Bank operates SouthState|Duncan-Williams, a registered broker-dealer headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee that serves primarily institutional clients across the U.S. in the fixed income business. The Bank also operates SouthState Advisory, Inc., a wholly owned registered investment advisor, and CBI Holding Company, LLC (&#8220;CBI&#8221;), which in turn owns Corporate Billing, a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers nationwide. The holding company also owns SSB Insurance Corp., a captive insurance subsidiary pursuant to Section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code. 

&#8203; 

At March 31, 2023, we had approximately $44.9 billion in assets and 5,085 full-time equivalent employees. Through our Bank branches, ATMs and online banking platforms, we provide our customers with a wide range of financial products and services, through a six (6) state footprint in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. These financial products and services include deposit accounts such as checking accounts, savings and time deposits of various types, safe deposit boxes, bank money orders, wire transfer and ACH services, brokerage services and alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds, trust and asset management services, loans of all types, including business loans, agriculture loans, real estate-secured (mortgage) loans, personal use loans, home improvement loans, automobile loans, manufactured housing loans, boat loans, credit cards, letters of credit, home equity lines of credit, treasury management services, and merchant services. 

&#8203; 

We also operate a correspondent banking and capital markets division within our national bank subsidiary, of which the majority of its bond salesmen, traders and operational personnel are housed in facilities located in Atlanta, Georgia, Memphis, Tennessee, Walnut Creek, California, and Birmingham, Alabama. This division&#8217;s primary revenue generating activities are related to its capital markets division, which includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities; and its correspondent banking division, which includes spread income earned on correspondent bank deposits (i.e., federal funds purchased) and correspondent bank checking account deposits and fees from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services for correspondents, asset/liability consulting related activities, international wires, and other clearing and corporate checking account services. 

&#8203; 

We have pursued, and continue to pursue, a growth strategy that focuses on organic growth, supplemented by acquisitions of select financial institutions, or branches in certain market areas.

&#8203; 

The following discussion describes our results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2022 and also analyzes our financial condition as of March 31, 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022 . Like most financial institutions, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we may pay interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is the amount of our net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. 

&#160; 

Of course, there are risks inherent in all loans, as such, we maintain an allowance for credit losses, otherwise referred to herein as ACL, to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. We establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for credit losses against our operating earnings. In the following discussion, we have included a detailed discussion of this process. 

&#8203; 

In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers. We incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings, the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits. We describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion. 

&#8203; 

The following sections also identify significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report. 

&#8203; 

Recent Events 

Regulatory Considerations 

In the aftermath of the recent bank failures, we expect that the banking agencies will propose certain actions, including special assessments to repay losses to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;)&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund. It is not yet possible to quantify the impact of these potential actions. 

Liquidity and Capital 

During the current quarter, the financial markets experienced some volatility in response to a small number of regional bank failures resulting from deposit runs generally related to high concentrations in particular customer segments, high levels of uninsured deposits and failures in interest rate risk management.

&#8203; 

Deposit flows are significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, internal pricing decisions and competition. Our deposits are primarily obtained from depositors located around our branch footprint, and we believe that we have attractive opportunities to capture additional retail and commercial deposits in our markets, in addition to having access to brokered deposits. At March 31, 2023, we had $36.4 billion in total deposits, of which approximately 70% were insured or collateralized. Our deposit base is comprised of 1.5 million accounts with an average deposit size of $24,000. Our top 10 and 20 deposit relationships represent 3% and 4%, respectively, of total deposits. 

&#8203; 

In addition to deposits, we have other contingency funding sources available to the Bank. At March 31, 2023, our Bank had a total FHLB credit facility of $6.9 billion, with $900.0 million in FHLB advances and $2.1 million in FHLB letters of credit outstanding at quarter-end, leaving $6.0 billion in availability on the FHLB credit facility. In addition, our Bank had $2.5 billion of credit available at the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s discount window and total federal funds credit lines of $300.0 million with no balances outstanding at quarter-end. The Bank also has an internal limit on brokered deposits of 15% of total deposits which would allow capacity of $5.5 billion as of March 31, 2023. The Bank had $1.4 billion of outstanding brokered deposits at the end of the quarter leaving $4.1 billion in available capacity. All of these resources would provide an additional $12.9 billion in funding if the Bank needed additional liquidity. In addition, the Bank also has $4.5 billion in unpledged securities at March 31, 2023 that can be pledged to obtain additional funds, if necessary. The Company has a $100.0 million unsecured line of credit with U.S. Bank National Association with no balance outstanding at March 31, 2023. We believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

In addition to adequate liquidity, the Company and Bank are considered well capitalized by all regulatory capital standards as it was significantly above the required capital levels as of March 31, 2023. The Company&#8217;s tier 1 leverage ratio, common equity tier 1 (&#8220;CET 1&#8221;) risk-based capital ratio and total risk-based capital ratio were 9.05%, 11.13% and 13.30%, respectively, at March 31, 2023. The Bank&#8217;s Tier 1 leverage ratio, CET 1 risk-based capital ratio and total risk-based capital ratio were 9.70%, 11.93% and 12.99%, respectively, at March 31, 2023. As permitted, we elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to available for sale securities from Tier 1, CET 1 and total risk-based capital; however, even if our unrealized losses as of March 31, 2023 in our available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios were recognized by selling the portfolios for liquidity purposes, all else being equal, our regulatory capital ratios would remain well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory classification. 

Atlantic Capital Bancshares, Inc. (&#8220;Atlantic Capital&#8221;) Merger 

On March 1, 2022, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Atlantic Capital in a stock transaction. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Atlantic Capital merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger. Immediately following the merger, Atlantic Capital&#8217;s wholly owned banking subsidiary, Atlantic Capital Bank, N.A. (&#8220;ACB&#8221;) merged with and into the Bank, the surviving bank in the bank merger. 

Shareholders of Atlantic Capital received 0.36 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock for each share of Atlantic Capital common stock they owned. In total, the purchase price for Atlantic Capital was $657.8 million. 

In the acquisition, the Company acquired $2.4 billion of loans, including Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) loans, at fair value, net of $54.3 million, or 2.24%, estimated discount to the outstanding principal balance, representing 10.0% of the Company&#8217;s total loans at December 31, 2021. Of the total loans acquired, management identified $137.9 million that had more than insignificantly deteriorated since origination and were thus determined to be PCD loans. Additional details regarding the Atlantic Capital merger are discussed in Note 4 &#8212; Mergers and Acquisitions. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

&#8203; 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and follow general practices within the banking industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by management&#8217;s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 2 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 &#8212; Recent Accounting and Regulatory Pronouncements of our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

The following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.

&#8203; 

Business Combinations 

&#8203; 

We account for acquisitions under FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations , which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, and liabilities assumed, are recorded at fair value. We adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , on January 1, 2020 which now requires us to record purchased financial assets with credit deterioration (PCD assets), defined as a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination or issuance, at the purchase price plus the allowance for credit losses expected at the time of acquisition. Under this method, there is no provision for credit losses affecting net income on acquisition of PCD assets. Changes in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for credit loss expense (or recovery of credit losses) in subsequent periods as they arise. Any non-credit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets with credit deterioration shall be allocated to each individual asset. At the acquisition date, the initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis shall be allocated to individual assets to appropriately allocate any non-credit discount or premium. The non-credit discount or premium, after the adjustment for the allowance for credit losses, shall be accreted into interest income using the interest method based on the effective interest rate determined after the adjustment for credit losses at the adoption date. 

&#8203; 

A purchased financial asset that does not qualify as a PCD asset is accounted for similar to an originated financial asset. Generally, this means that an entity recognizes the allowance for credit losses for non-PCD assets through net income at the time of acquisition. In addition, both the credit discount and non-credit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets that do not qualify as PCD assets shall be allocated to each individual asset. This combined discount or premium shall be accreted into interest income using the effective yield method. 

&#8203; 

For further discussion of our loan accounting and acquisitions, see Note 2&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 4&#8212;Mergers and Acquisitions, Note 6&#8212;Loans and Note 7&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses.

&#8203; 

Allowance for Credit Losses or ACL 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. Management used the systematic methodology to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, management&#8217;s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion. The Company&#8217;s ACL recorded on the balance sheet reflects management&#8217;s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses. See Note 2 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL. See also Note 7 &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; in this MD&#38;A.

&#8203; 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

&#8203; 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in a business combination. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the balance of goodwill was $1.9 billion. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset&#8217;s fair value. 

We evaluated the carrying value of goodwill as of October 31, 2022, our annual test date, and determined that no impairment charge was necessary. We continue to monitor the impact of current economic conditions and other events on the Company&#8217;s business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Core deposit intangibles and client list intangibles consist primarily of amortizing assets established during the acquisition of other banks. For the period ending March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the core deposit intangibles totaled $109.6 million and $116.5 million, respectively. This includes whole bank acquisitions and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities from other financial institutions. Core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of long-term deposit relationships acquired in these transactions. Client list intangibles represent the value of long-term client relationships for the correspondent banking and wealth and trust management business. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives, such as deposit accounts in the case of core deposit intangible, on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from this intangible. The estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness. 

Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets 

&#8203; 

Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in our consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of certain assets and liabilities, including loans, available for sale securities, ACL, write downs of OREO properties and bank properties held for sale, accumulated depreciation, net operating loss carry forwards, accretion income, deferred compensation, intangible assets, mortgage servicing rights, and post-retirement benefits. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that a deferred tax asset is not realizable. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2023 were $165.2 million which was down slightly from $177.8 million as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in deferred tax assets during the first three months of 2023 was mostly attributable to a decrease in the unrealized losses in the securities portfolio, an increase in deferred loan fees and costs, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for credit losses. 

&#8203; 

The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Additionally, income tax returns are filed by the Company or its subsidiaries in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia and city of New York City. We evaluate the need for income tax reserves related to uncertain income tax positions but had no material reserves at March 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Results of Operations 

&#8203; 

Overview 

&#8203; 

We reported consolidated net income of $139.9 million, or diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) of $1.83, for the first quarter of 2023 as compared to consolidated net income of $100.3 million, or diluted EPS of $1.39, in the comparable period of 2022, a 39.5% increase in consolidated net income and a 31.7% increase in diluted EPS. The $39.6 million increase in consolidated net income was the net result of the following items: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; A $179.9 million increase in interest income, resulting from a $159.7 million increase in interest income from loans and loans held for sale, a $14.1 million increase in interest income from investment securities, and a $6.1 million increase in interest income on federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreement to resell and interest-bearing deposits. These increases were mainly due to the increase in yields in all categories of interest-earning assets in the current rising rate environment as the Federal Reserve Bank has raised it federal funds rate 475 basis points in 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. The increase in interest income is also due to the increase in the average balance of loans of $5.5 billion, through both organic loan growth and loans acquired through the Atlantic Capital acquisition during the first quarter of 2022 ; &#9679; A $60.2 million increase in interest expense, which resulted from a $51.4 million increase in interest expense from deposits, a $2.6 million increase in interest expense in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and a $6.2 million increase in interest expense from corporate and subordinated debentures and other borrowings. These increases in expense resulted mainly from an increase in costs of all categories of interest-bearing liabilities as interest rates have increased in 2022 and 2023. This increase in average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was particularly felt in the first quarter of 2023 with the stress in financial markets and liquidity as the average cost increased 68 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2022; &#9679; A $41.5 million increase in the provision for allowance for credit losses, as the Company recorded provision for credit losses of $33.1 million in the first quarter of 2023 while recording a release of the allowance for credit losses of $8.4 million in the first quarter of 2022. As the economy continued to stabilize from the COVID-19 pandemic and economic forecasts improved, the Company continued to release allowance for credit losses in the first quarter of 2022 that were built in 2020 during the pandemic. In the first quarter of 2023, we recorded a provision for allowance for credit losses as economic forecasts reflected the continued stress of inflation and rising interest rates that began in mid 2022 ; &#9679; A $14.7 million decrease in noninterest income, primarily from a decline in mortgage banking income of $6.3 million and correspondent banking and capital market income of $14.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $1.9 million in fees on deposit accounts and a $3.3 million increase in other noninterest income driven by an increase of $1.6 million in income from bank owned life insurance and a $1.0 million legal settlement. (See Noninterest Income section on page 59 for further discussion); &#9679; An $11.9 million increase in noninterest expense, which resulted primarily from an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $6.4 million, in FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges of $1.5 million and in other noninterest expense of $4.6 million driven by an increase in business development and staff related expense of $1.7 million, an increase in other taxes of $1.9 million and $2.0 million increase in expense related to our earnings credit program for certain deposit accounts. (See Noninterest Expense section on page 60 for further discussion); and &#9679; Higher income tax provision of $12.0 million primarily due to higher pretax book income between the two quarters. The Company recorded pretax book income of $179.0 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to pretax book income of $127.4 million in the first quarter of 2022. Our effective tax rate was 21.84% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 21.26% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. &#8203; 

Our quarterly efficiency ratio decreased to 51.4% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 63.0% in the first quarter of 2022. The decrease in the efficiency ratio compared to the first quarter of 2022 was the result of the 29.8% increase in the total of tax-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income being greater than the increase in noninterest expense (excluding amortization of intangibles) of 6.0%. The increase in income was mainly due to a 45.1% increase in tax-equivalent net interest income reflective of the rising rate environment where our interest-earning assets repriced more quickly than our interest-bearing liabilities. 

&#160; 

Basic and diluted EPS were $1.84 and $1.83, respectively, for the first quarter of 2023, compared to $1.40 and $1.39, respectively for the first quarter of 2022. The increase in basic and diluted EPS was due to a 39.5% increase in net income in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, partially offset by an increase in average basic common shares of 6.2%. The increase in net income was mainly due to the increase in net interest income resulting from the rising rate environment in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022.

&#8203; 

&#9679; For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the return on average assets, the return on average equity and the return on average tangible equity increased compared to the same periods in 2022. These increases were primarily due to the increase in net income of $39.6 million, or 39.5%, which was mainly attributable to higher net interest income of $119.7 million due to the increase in yield on interest-earning assets in the rising rate environment. Average assets and average equity both increased in 2023 from 2022 but at lower percentages of 2.8% and 4.9%, respectively. &#9679; The equity-to-assets ratio was 11.68% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of 0.45% from March 31, 2022, which was mainly due to the increase in total equity of 1.4% resulting from the net income earned during the last twelve months. &#9679; Dividend payout ratios were 27.09% for the three-month period ending March 31, 2023 and 33.71% for the three-month period ending March 31, 2022. The decrease in the dividend payout ratio is due to higher net income in the current quarter compared to the same period in the prior year, while the amount of the dividend paid per share increased at a lower percentage to $0.50 in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $0.49 in the first quarter of 2022. Net Interest Income and Margin 

&#8203; 

Non-tax equivalent net interest income increased $119.7 million, or 45.8%, to $381.3 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $261.5 million in the same period in 2022. Interest earning assets averaged $39.4 billion during the three months period ended March 31, 2023 compared to $38.6 billion for the same period in 2022, an increase of $844.7 million, or 2.2%. Interest bearing liabilities averaged $24.6 billion during the three months period ended March 31, 2023 compared to $24.9 billion for the same period in 2022, a decrease of $236.2 billion, or 0.9% . 

The Federal Reserve continued to raise rates in 2023 with two increases of 25 basis points, the most recent in early March 2023, resulting in a range of 4.75% to 5.00% at March 31, 2023. As a result, the Company operated under an increasing rate environment for the first quarter of 2023 while it operated under a much lower rate environment in the first quarter of 2022. Some key highlights are outlined below:

&#9679; Non-Tax Equivalent (&#8220;TE&#8221;) and TE net interest margin increased by 117 basis points and 116 basis points, respectively, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter of 2022 due to the increase in the yield on interest earning assets of 180 basis points, which was only partially offset by the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 99 basis points. In the rising rate environment in 2022 and the first quarter of 2023, our interest-earning assets, specifically our loans, repriced more quickly than our interest-bearing liabilities, specifically our deposits, leading to the increase in net interest margin. &#8203; 

&#160; 

o Non-TE yield on interest-earning assets for the first quarter of 2023 increased 180 basis points to 4.64% from the comparable period in 2022, primarily due to higher yields on all interest-earning assets as the Federal Reserve Bank raised interest rates 475 basis points starting late in first quarter of 2022. The increases in interest rates, in combination with the increase in the average balance of the higher yielding loan portfolio of $5.6 billion, along with the decline in the average balance of lower yielding interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold of $5.0 billion, affected the overall yield increase between the comparable periods. o The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the first quarter of 2023 increased 99 basis points from the same period in 2022. This increase was driven by the effects from the rising rate environment on the repricing of all deposit accounts, federal funds purchased and securities purchased with agreement to repurchase, and trust preferred corporate debt. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 89 basis points as the increase occurred in all deposit categories. The average cost of federal funds purchased and securities purchased with agreement to repurchase increased 190 basis points while the average cost of corporate and subordinated debentures increased 124 basis points. Other borrowings, consisting of FHLB advances had an average cost of 4.76% during the first quarter of 2023. The increase in overall average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was also due to the decrease in the average balance of lower costing transaction and money market deposit accounts, along with savings deposit accounts, while the higher costing certificates and other time deposits and other borrowings increased compared to the same period a year ago. Our overall cost of funds, including noninterest-bearing deposits, was 0.75% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 0.10% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. &#8203;

The tables below summarize the analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 and net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis.

(1) Investment securities (taxable) and (tax-exempt) include trading securities. Investment Securities 

&#8203; 

The yield and interest earned on investment securities increased in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. This is a result of the Bank carrying a higher average balance in investment securities in 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. The average balance of investment securities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased $337.3 million from the comparable periods in 2022. The yield on the investment securities increased 62 basis points during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. Both the average balance and the yield on the investment securities increased as a result of the Bank increasing the size of its investment securities portfolio in the first nine months of 2022 as interest rates rose, as well as the Bank retaining a portion of the investment securities portfolio acquired from Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Loans 

&#8203; 

Interest earned on loans held for investment increased $160.2 million to $393.0 million in the first quarter ended March 31, 2023 from the comparable period in 2022. Interest earned on loans held for investment included loan accretion income recognized during the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 of $7.4 million and $6.7 million, respectively, an increase of $657,000. Some key highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 are outlined below:

&#8203; 

&#9679; Our non-TE yield on total loans increased 144 basis points in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 due to a 161 basis-point increase in the yield on the acquired loan portfolio and a 151 basis-point increase in yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio. These increases in both portfolios were due to the rising rate environment. 

o The yield on the acquired loan portfolio increased 161 basis points to 5.97% in the first quarter of 2023 from 4.36% in the same period in 2022 . Interest income on the acquired loan portfolio increased $14.8 million during the same period. 

&#9726; The yield and interest income on acquired loans increased due to the rising rate environment in effect during the current quarter of 2023. The Bank was operating under a lower rate environment during the first quarter of 2022 as the Federal Reserve did not begin increasing interest rates until mid-March 2022. Further, the loan accretion income increased by $657,000 during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 due to the first quarter of 2023 having a full quarter of loan accretion from the Atlantic Capital transaction while the first quarter of 2022 only had one month of loan accretion. &#9726; For the a cquired loans, the increase in interest income from the increase in yield was partially offset by the average balance decreasing by $1.3 billion from the first quarter of 2022. This decrease was mainly related to the impact from the paydowns and pay-offs of loans along with renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. 

o The yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio increased 151 basis points to 5.02% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 3.51% in the same period in 2022. Interest income on the non-acquired loan portfolio increased $145.4 million during the same period. 

&#9726; The yield and interest income on non-acquired loans increased due to the rising rate environment during 2022 and the first quarter of 2023 as the Federal Reserve increased interest rates 475 basis points. Both new loans and renewal have repriced in a much higher rate environment resulting in a higher yield. &#9726; For the non-a cquired loans, interest income increased due to an increase in the average loan balance of $6.8 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, primarily through organic loan growth and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio . &#160; Interest-Bearing Liabilities 

&#8203; 

The quarter-to-date average balance of interest-bearing liabilities decreased $236.2 million, or 0.9%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 99 basis points to 1.14% and the overall cost of funds, including demand deposits, increased by 65 basis points to 0.75% in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. Some key highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 include: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; The cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.97% for the first quarter of 2023 compared to 0.08% for the same period in 2022. 

o Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by $51.4 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 as interest expense on all interest-bearing deposit accounts increased. Interest expense on transaction and money market accounts, savings, and certificates and other time deposits increased $38.3 million, $1.6 million, and $11.4 million, respectively. The increase in the cost and interest expense was due to the repricing of deposits in the rising rate environment in 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. 

&#160; 

o The average balance of interest-bearing deposits decreased by $441.3 million as interest-bearing transaction accounts and money market accounts and savings accounts declined by $706.8 million, partially offset by an increase in certificate and other time deposits of $265.5 million. As customers moved funds from interest-bearing checking and savings accounts, seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment and deposit insurance coverage, the Company increased its balance in brokered time deposits and in in-market time deposits. In March of 2023, brokered deposits increased from $150.0 million to $1.4 billion to replace the decline in interest-bearing transaction and savings accounts. This shift from the lower costing interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts and savings accounts to the higher costing time deposits increased both the overall cost of deposits and interest expense. Overall, interest-bearing deposits had been slower to reprice in the rising rate environment but the cost had begun to increase significantly in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the effects were more significant in the first quarter of 2023. &#9679; The cost on the corporate and subordinated debt increased by 124 basis points for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, driven by the effects from the rising rate environment on the repricing of variable rate trust preferred corporate debt. 

o The interest expense from corporate and subordinated debt increased $1.6 million during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. o The average balance of corporate and subordinated debt increased by $38.1 million due to the $78.4 million of subordinated debentures assumed from Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022, partially offset by the redemption of $13.0 million of subordinated debentures in late June 2022. &#9679; The cost of repurchase agreements was 0.72% for the first quarter of 2023 compared to 0.15% for the same period in 2022. The increase in cost was due to the rising interest rate environment. &#9679; The cost of federal funds purchased increased 446 basis points due to the rising rate environment. Although the average balance decreased by $161.6 million, the interest expense increased $2.1 million as the average costs increased. &#9679; The cost of other borrowings, consisting of FHLB advances, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was 4.76% and interest expense was $4.6 million. The Bank had $900 million outstanding in FHLB advances at March 31, 2023 with an average balance of $393.3 million during the quarter. There were no outstanding balances in other borrowings during the first quarter of 2022. &#8203; 

We continue to monitor and adjust rates paid on deposit products as part of our strategy to manage our net interest margin. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits, CDs, other time deposits, federal funds purchased, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include NOW, HSA, IOLTA, and Market Rate checking accounts. 

&#8203; 

Noninterest-Bearing Deposits 

&#8203; 

Noninterest-bearing deposits are transaction accounts that provide our Bank with &#8220;interest-free&#8221; sources of funds. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $0.5 million, or 4.1%, to $12.8 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $12.3 billion during the same period in 2022. The increase in average noninterest-bearing deposits was primarily due to the assumed noninterest-bearing deposit balances from Atlantic Capital, which only affected the average balance for the last 30 days of the first quarter of 2022. The noninterest-bearing deposit balances from Atlantic Capital on the acquisition date were approximately $1.4 billion in total. Actual noninterest-bearing deposits declined $746.1 million from December 31, 2022. This decline was due to both the rising rate environment as customers seek higher yields, in addition to some customers spreading deposit funds amongst institutions to achieve full deposit insurance coverage.

Noninterest Income 

&#8203; 

Noninterest income provides us with additional revenues that are significant sources of income. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, noninterest income comprised 15.8% and 24.8%, respectively, of total net interest income and noninterest income.

&#8203; 

Noninterest income decreased by $14.7 million, or 17.1%, during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. This quarterly change in total noninterest income resulted from the following: 

&#9679; Correspondent banking and capital markets income in the first quarter of 2023 decreased by $14.4 million, or 51.4%, compared to the same quarter in 2022. The decline was due to the expense attributable to the variation margin payments for centrally cleared swaps and lower commissions and fees earned on fixed income security sales during 2023 as the volume in sales declined from 2022. We recorded expense of $8.4 million related to variation margin payments in the first quarter of 2023 compared to expense of $44,000 in in the first quarter of 2022. The increase in expense in 2023 was due to the rise in interest rates which caused an increase in value in our centrally cleared interest rate swaps with LCH and CME. This increase in value in the interest rate swaps with LCH and CME increased the amounts that LCH and CME had to settle daily with the Company which increased our expense. &#9679; Mortgage banking income decreased by $6.3 million, or 59.1%, during the current quarter compared to the same period of the prior year, which was comprised of a $5.2 million, or 65.4%, decrease in secondary market mortgage income and a $1.0 million, or 39.7%, decrease in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge. Mortgage production declined from $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2022 to $556 million in the first quarter of 2023. During the current quarter, the Company also allocated a lower percentage of its mortgage production to the secondary market compared to the same quarter in 2022, as the allocation declined from 47% in the first quarter of 2022 to 28% in the first quarter of 2023. The allocation of mortgage production between portfolio and secondary market depends on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate quarter to quarter. Both the decline in mortgage production and the decline in allocation to the secondary market led to the decline in mortgage banking income. 

o The decrease in mortgage income from the secondary market was comprised of a $11.9 million decline in gain on sale of mortgage loans, which is net of the commission expense related to mortgage production, offset by a $6.7 million increase in the change in fair value of the pipeline, loans held for sale and MBS forward trades. Mortgage commission expense was $1.3 million during the first quarter of 2023 compared to $5.7 million during the comparable period in 2022. o The decrease in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge, in the first quarter of 2023 was due to a $1.3 million decrease in the change in fair value of the MSR including decay, slightly offset by a $282,000 increase from servicing fee income. The decrease in fair value of the MSR is primarily due to a decrease in the change in fair value from interest rates of $14.1 million and an $821,000 decline in MSR decay, offset by an increase in gains on the MSR hedge of $12.0 million. The increase in the servicing fee income is due to the increase in size of the servicing portfolio. &#9679; Service charges on deposit accounts were higher by $1.7 million, or 9.1%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was mainly due to an increase in account maintenance fee income of $1.8 million due to having a full quarter of fee income related to Atlantic Capital accounts in the first quarter of 2023 compared to just one month&#8217;s activity in the first quarter of 2022. 

&#160; 

&#9679; Other income increased by $1.7 million, or 128.7%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 . This increase was primarily due to income of $960,000 from legal settlement in the first quarter of 2023 along with the Company showing a gain in sale of fixed assets of $65,000 in the first quarter of 2023 compared to a loss of $281,000 in the comparable period of 2022. &#9679; Bank owned life insurance income increased $1.6 million, or 29.5%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022. This increase was due to an increase in income from the payout of bank owned life insurance policies of $925,000 during the first quarter of 2023 along with having a full quarter&#8217;s effect from the policies acquired through Atlantic Capital in 2023. &#9679; SBA income, including the impact from the change to fair value accounting prospectively applied beginning with the period ending June 30, 2022, increased by $542,000, or 17.0%, compared to 2022. SBA income includes changes in fair value of the servicing asset, loan servicing fees and gains on sale of SBA loans. The increase was attributable to an increase in SBA servicing fee income of $426,000 and the change in fair value of the SBA servicing asset of $453,000 partially offset by a decline in the gains on sale of SBA loans of $338,000. The increase in servicing fee income is mainly attributable to additional business resulting from the acquisition of Atlantic Capital. &#9679; Trust and investment services income for the first quarter of 2023 increased by $219,000 from the first quarter of 2022 as assets under management have increased $508.9 million, or 7.4%, in that same time frame.

&#8203; 

Noninterest expense increased by $11.9 million, or 5.2%, in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022. The quarterly increase in total noninterest expense primarily resulted from the following: 

&#9679; Salaries and employee benefits increased $6.4 million, or 4.6%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to annual salary increases, offset by a decline in total deferred loan costs mainly driven by lower mortgage production and a decrease in commission and incentive expenses. We recorded a total of $8.3 million in commission and $21.5 million in incentive expense during the first quarter of 2023, compared to $10.8 million and $22.2 million, respectively, during the first quarter of 2022. &#9679; Other noninterest expense increased $2.8 million, or 19.4%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was mainly attributable to a $2.0 million increase in earnings credit expense to Homeowners Association (&#8220;HOA&#8221;) customers and a $1.9 million increase in state franchise and occupation tax payments. The Bank provides a credit to HOA customers based on the average deposit balances held that reduces fees for other services provided. This increase was due to having a full quarter&#8217;s expense in 2023 as this line of business was acquired through the Atlantic Capital transaction on March 1, 2022 along with growth in the business since the acquisition. The tax payment increase was mainly attributable to occupancy tax payments made to the state of Georgia, as the Company expanded its presence in the state through the acquisition of Atlantic Capital completed in March 2022, along with increases in other franchise taxes paid to states. These increases were partially offset by the cost associated with the settlement of two lawsuits of $1.8 million recorded during the first quarter of 2022. &#8203; 

&#160; 

&#9679; Business development and staff related expense increased $1.7 million, or 39.3%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was mainly due to the increase in employees resulting from the merger with Atlantic Capital, an increase in employee expenses including employee travel expense, convention and meeting expense as the COVID-19 pandemic receded, and recruitment and relocation costs associated with the Company investing in new talent. &#9679; FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges increased $1.5 million, or 30.8%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was mainly due to an increase in the FDIC assessment of $1.8 million as the Company continues to grow in size and complexity along with the effects resulting from the reduction in the Company&#8217;s liquidity compared to the first quarter of 2022. &#9679; Information services expense increased $732,000, or 3.8% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was due to additional cost associated with the Company updating systems as it grows in size and complexity. &#9679; Merger, branch consolidation and severance related expense decreased $864,000, or 8.4%, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was due to a $9.0 million decrease in merger and branch consolidation related expense pertaining to previous acquisitions. M erger and branch consolidation related expense of $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2023 consisted mainly of costs associated with the Atlantic Capital acquisition while expense of $10.3 million in the first quarter of 2022 was mainly attributable to both the Atlantic Capital and CenterState acquisitions. The decrease in merger and branch consolidation expense was mostly offset by severance related payments totaling $8.1 million related to restructuring costs recorded in March 2023. The restructuring costs include approximately $7.0 million of severance related expense pertaining to the elimination of the Company&#8217;s executive officer position and approximately $1.1 million of severance related expense pertaining to the reduction in force of the Company&#8217;s mortgage division. Income Tax Expense 

&#8203; 

Our effective tax rate was 21.84% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 21.26% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in the effective rate for the quarter, when compared to the same period in the prior year, is driven by an increase in pretax income, an increase in stock based compensation, an increase in disallowed interest expense, and an increase in non-deductible FDIC premiums, partially offset by a decrease in non-deductible merger expenses associated with the Atlantic Capital transaction that closed during the first quarter of 2022. 

Analysis of Financial Condition 

Summary 

Our total assets increased approximately $1.0 billion, or 2.3%, from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023, to approximately $44.9 billion. Within total assets, cash and cash equivalents increased $684.1 million, or 52.1%, investment securities decreased $175.1 million, or 2.1%, and loans increased $518.3 million or 1.7% during the period. Within total liabilities, deposits grew $51.0 million, or 0.1%, and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $12.3 million, or 2.2%. Total borrowings increased $899.9 million, or 229.4%. Total shareholder&#8217;s equity increased $174.1 million, or 3.4%. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company took in $900 million in short-term FHLB borrowings and $1.2 billion in brokered time deposits to increase our liquidity. The increase in FHLB borrowings contributed to the increase in cash and cash equivalents. The increase in loans was due to normal organic growth. Deposit growth remained flat for the quarter as noninterest bearing, interest bearing checking and savings and money market accounts declined $746.1 million, $639.5 million and $262.0 million, respectively. The declines were replaced by growth in time deposits of $1.7 billion including $1.2 billion in brokered time deposits. Our loan to deposit ratio was 84% and 83% at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively while our percentage of non-interest bearing deposit accounts to total deposits was 34% and 36%, respectively at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Investment Securities 

We use investment securities, our second largest category of earning assets, to generate interest income, provide liquidity, fund loan demand or deposit liquidation, and pledge as collateral for public funds deposits, repurchase agreements, derivative exposures and to augment borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. At March 31, 2023, investment securities totaled $8.0 billion, compared to $8.2 billion at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $175.1 million, or 2.1%. At March 31, 2023, approximately 64.4% of the investment portfolio was classified as available for sale and approximately 33.0% was classified as held to maturity. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we purchased $63.8 million of capital stock with the Federal Home Loan Bank classified as other investment securities on the balance sheet of which we sold back $25.5 million. The net increase to the capital stock holding for the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta of $38.3 million during the quarter was due to the increase in Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. During the first quarter of 2023, the Bank did not purchase securities for the core investment portfolio. There were maturities, paydowns, and calls of investment securities totaling $155.6 million and sales of totaling $150.8 million. Net amortization of premiums was $5.4 million in the first three months of 2023. 

&#8203; 

At March 31, 2023, the unrealized net loss of the available for sale securities portfolio was $816.5 million, or 13.7%, below its amortized cost basis, compared to an unrealized net loss of $889.3 million, or 14.3%, at December 31, 2022. At March 31, 2023, the unrealized net loss of the held to maturity securities portfolio was $409.1 million, or 15.5%, below its amortized cost basis, compared to an unrealized net loss of $433.1 million, or 16.1%, at December 31, 2022. The decrease in the unrealized net loss in the available for sale investment portfolio of $72.8 million and $24.0 million for the held to maturity portfolio during the first three months of 2023 was mainly due to a decrease in interest rates during the quarter and other dynamic market factors.

* Agency mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;), agency collateralized mortgage-obligations (CMO) and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;) are guaranteed by the issuing government-sponsored enterprise (&#8220;GSE&#8221;) as to the timely payments of principal and interest. Except for Government National Mortgage Association securities, which have the full faith and credit backing of the United States Government, the GSE alone is responsible for making payments on this guaranty. While the rating agencies have not rated any of the MBS, CMO and CMBS issued, senior debt securities issued by GSEs are rated consistently as &#8220;Triple-A.&#8221; Most market participants consider agency MBS, CMOs and CMBSs as carrying an implied Aaa rating (S&#38;P rating of AA+) because of the guarantees of timely payments and selection criteria of mortgages backing the securities. We do not own any private label mortgage-backed securities. The balances presented under the ratings above reflect the amortized cost of the investment securities. 

At March 31, 2023 , we had 1,244 investment securities, including both available for sale and held to maturity, which totaled a $1.2 billion unrealized loss position. At December 31, 2022, we had 1,311 investment securities, including both available for sale and held to maturity, in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $1.3 billion. The total number of investment securities with an unrealized loss position decreased by 67 securities, while the total dollar amount of the unrealized loss decreased by $96.8 million. The level of unrealized losses for each period is due to an overall increase in short- and long-term interest rates during 2022 and 2023. Short- and long-term U.S treasury rates did decline slightly in the first quarter of 2023, which caused the unrealized loss to decline slightly during the quarter. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

All investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2023 continue to perform as scheduled. We have evaluated the securities and have determined that the decline in fair value, relative to its amortized cost, is not due to credit-related factors. In addition, we have the ability to hold these securities within the portfolio until maturity or until the value recovers, and we believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovery. We continue to monitor all of our securities with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that we will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of our securities may be sold or would require a charge to earnings as a provision for credit losses in such periods. Any charges as a provision for credit losses related to investment securities could impact cash flow, tangible capital or liquidity. See Note 2 &#8212; Summary of Significant Account Policies and Note 5 &#8212; Investment Securities for further discussion on the application of ASU 2016-13 on the investment securities portfolio. 

As securities held for investment are purchased, they are designated as held to maturity or available for sale based upon our intent, which incorporates liquidity needs, interest rate expectations, asset/liability management strategies, and capital requirements. Although securities classified as available for sale may be sold from time to time to meet liquidity or other needs, it is not our normal practice to trade this segment of the investment securities portfolio. From time to time, the Bank may execute transactions to reposition the investment portfolio. Such activity has not expanded the broad asset classes used by the Bank. While management generally holds these assets on a long-term basis or until maturity, any short-term investments or securities available for sale could be converted at an earlier point, depending partly on changes in interest rates and alternative investment opportunities.

(1) Yields on tax exempt income have been presented on a taxable equivalent basis in the table above. (2) FRB, FHLB and other non-marketable equity securities have no set maturity date and are classified in &#8220;Due after 10 Years.&#8221; (3) The total values presented in the table above represent total fair value for available for sale and amortized cost for held to maturity. Approximately 86.5% of the investment portfolio is comprised of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Government agency securities, and U.S. Government Agency Mortgage-backed securities. These securities may be pledged to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta or the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Discount Window or Bank Term Funding Program. Approximately 13.1% of the investment portfolio is comprised of municipal securities. A portion of the municipal bond portfolio may be pledged to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta subject to their credit approval. Approximately 98.9% of the municipal bond portfolio has ratings in the Double A or Triple A category. 

&#8203; 

In March 2023, we sold approximately $125.3 million of municipal securities given advantageous market conditions. The primary rationale for the sale was to reduce municipal and portfolio duration/price risk at an opportune moment in fixed income markets. As of March 31, 2023, the portfolio had an effective duration of 5.89 years. Our target for effective duration is 3 to 5 years. The portfolio duration is currently outside of the target range due to portfolio repositioning and extension in the mortgage-backed securities due to the historic rise in rates. We continue to monitor duration risk and seek to align actual duration with the target range.

Other Investments 

&#8203; 

Other investment securities include primarily our investments in FHLB and FRB stock with no readily determinable market value. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. As of March 31, 2023, we determined that there was no impairment on our other investment securities. As of March 31, 2023, other investment securities represented app roximately $218.0 million, or 0.49% of total assets, and primarily consists of FHLB and FRB stock which totals $203.6 million, or 0.45% of total as sets. There were no gains or losses on the sales of these securities for three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Trading Securities 

We have a trading portfolio associated with our Correspondent Bank Division and its subsidiary SouthState|Duncan-Williams. This portfolio is carried at fair value and realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in trading securities revenue, a component of Correspondent Banking and Capital Market Income in our Consolidated Statements of Net Income. Securities purchased for this portfolio have primarily been municipal bonds, treasuries and mortgage-backed agency securities, which are held for short periods of time and totaled $16.0 million and $31.3 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

Loans Held for Sale 

&#8203; 

The balance of mortgage loans held for sale decreased $1.7 million from December 31, 2022 to $27.3 million at March 31, 2023. Total mortgage production was $556 million in the first quarter of 2023. This compares to $693 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Mortgage production has continued to decline as mortgage rates have increased. The percentage of mortgage production booked to portfolio instead of being sold into the secondary market decreased to 72% compared 81% in the prior quarter. The secondary pipeline increased to $107 million at March 31, 2023 compared to $39 million at the end of last quarter. The allocation of mortgage production between portfolio and secondary market depends on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate over time.

Total loans, net of deferred loan costs and fees (excluding mortgage loans held for sale), increased by $518.3 million, or 7.0% annualized, to $30.7 billion at March 31, 2023. Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by $945.4 million, or 16.8% annualized, driven by organic growth. Commercial non-owner occupied loans, commercial owner occupied loans and consumer owner occupied loans led the way with $275.1 million, $143.1 million and $393.9 million in year-to-date loan growth, respectively, or 20.2%, 15.7%, and 36.5% annualized growth, respectively. The acquired loan portfolio decreased by $427.1 million, or 23.5% annualized. This decline in acquired loans was due to paydowns and payoffs in both the PCD and Non-PCD loan categories along with renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The main categories that declined were commercial non-owner occupied loans, commercial and industrial loans and commercial owner occupied loans with $111.9 million, $89.1 million and $80.8 million in year-to-date loan growth. Acquired loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to 22.5% and non-acquired loans as a percentage of the overall portfolio increased to 77.5% at March 31, 2023. This compares to acquired loans as a percentage of total loans of 24.4% and non-acquired loans as a percentage of total loans of 75.6% at December 31, 2022.

Allowance for Credit Losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects management&#8217;s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. The Company established the incremental increase in the ACL at adoption through equity and subsequent adjustments through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings. The Company records loans charged off against the ACL and subsequent recoveries, if any, increase the ACL when they are recognized. Please see Note 2 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL.

&#8203; 

&#160; 

As stated in Note 2 &#8211; Significant Accounting Policies under the caption Allowance for Credit Losses , management uses systematic methodologies to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, management&#8217;s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. The Company&#8217;s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects management&#8217;s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses. The Company&#8217;s ACL is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans. 

&#8203; 

The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans with similar risk characteristics are grouped into homogenous segments, or pools, for analysis. The Discounted Cash Flow (&#8220;DCF&#8221;) method is used for each loan in a pool, and the results are aggregated at the pool level. A periodic tendency to default and absolute loss given default are applied to a projective model of the loan&#8217;s cash flow while considering prepayment and principal curtailment effects. The analysis produces expected cash flows for each instrument in the pool by pairing loan-level term information (e.g., maturity date, payment amount, interest rate, etc.) with top-down pool assumptions (e.g., default rates and prepayment speeds). The Company has identified the following portfolio segments: Owner-Occupied Commercial Real Estate, Non Owner-Occupied Commercial Real Estate, Multifamily, Municipal, Commercial and Industrial, Commercial Construction and Land Development, Residential Construction, Residential Senior Mortgage, Residential Junior Mortgage, Revolving Mortgage, and Consumer and Other. 

&#8203; 

In determining the proper level of the ACL, management has determined that the loss experience of the Bank provides the best basis for its assessment of expected credit losses. The Company therefore used its own historical credit loss experience by each loan segment over an economic cycle, while excluding loss experience from certain acquired institutions (i.e., failed banks). For most of the segment models for collectively evaluated loans, the Company incorporated two or more macroeconomic drivers using a statistical regression modeling methodology. 

&#8203; 

Management considers forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses. The Company subscribes to a third-party service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the United States economy. The baseline, along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios, is used by management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and takes into consideration the scenarios in relation to actual economic and other data, such as gross domestic product growth, monetary and fiscal policy, inflation, supply chain issues and global events like the Russian/Ukraine conflict, as well as the volatility and magnitude of changes within those scenarios quarter over quarter, and consideration of conditions within the Bank&#8217;s operating environment and geographic area. Additional forecast scenarios may be weighted along with the baseline forecast to arrive at the final reserve estimate. While periods of relative economic stability should generally lead to stability in forecast scenarios and weightings to estimate credit losses, periods of instability can likewise require management to adjust the selection of scenarios and weightings, in accordance with the accounting standards. For the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straight-line approach. The Company generally uses a four-quarter forecast and a four-quarter reversion period. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

It is widely acknowledged that the chances of recession are still high. Accordingly, management continues to use a blended forecast scenario of the baseline and more severe scenario, depending on the circumstances and economic outlook. For the quarter ending March 31, 2023, management selected a baseline weighting of 50%, a 25% weighting for an upside scenario and a 25% weighting for the more severe scenario compared to a baseline weighting of 75% and the more severe scenario of 25% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The shift in weightings among the three scenarios reflects recognition of downside risks in the economic forecast from persistent levels of inflation and rising interest rates, geopolitical tension and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and global supply chain, energy and commodity issues. The more severe scenario reflected a moderate increase in severity from the prior quarter and was viewed as less likely by management. While employment figures still showed resilience and actual loan losses remain at very low levels, moderate downward shifts in forecasted commercial real estate price index, national house price index and GDP in the more severe scenario increased expected loss rates, primarily for Commercial Construction and Commercial Real Estate loans. The resulting provision was approximately $33.1 million during the first quarter of 2023, including a provision for unfunded commitments of $17.9 million. 

&#8203; 

Included in its systematic methodology to determine its ACL, management considers the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. These qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation (i.e., formulaic model results). Each period the Company considers qualitative factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework that includes the following: (1) lending policy; (2) economic conditions not captured in models; (3) volume and mix of loan portfolio; (4) past due trends; (5) concentration risk; (6) external factors; and (7) model limitations. 

&#8203; 

When a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with its segment, the asset is assessed to determine whether it should be included in another pool or should be individually evaluated. The Company&#8217;s threshold for individually evaluated loans includes all non-accrual loans with a net book balance in excess of $1.0 million. Management will monitor the credit environment and make adjustments to this threshold in the future if warranted. Based on the threshold above, consumer financial assets will generally remain in pools unless they meet the dollar threshold. The expected credit losses on individually evaluated loans will be estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis unless the loan meets the criteria for use of the fair value of collateral, either by virtue of an expected foreclosure or through meeting the definition of collateral-dependent. Financial assets that have been individually evaluated can be returned to a pool for purposes of estimating the expected credit loss insofar as their credit profile improves and the repayment terms were not considered to be unique to the asset. 

&#8203; 

Management measures expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan. When determining the contractual term, the Company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. In the course of resolving issues where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, the Bank may choose to modify the contractual terms of certain loans. Longstanding TDR accounting rules were replaced with ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (See Note 3 Recent Accounting Pronouncements). The Company adopted the retirement of TDR guidance, effective January 1, 2023. In accordance with the adoption of ASU 2022-02, any loans modified to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are reviewed by the Bank to determine if an interest rate reduction, a term extension, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, a principal forgiveness, or any combination of these has occurred. 

&#8203; 

The ACL includes expected losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Losses on modifications over $1 million to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are estimated on an individual basis. Because the effect of the remainder of modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already incorporated into the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, they are accounted for as pooled loans. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

For purchased credit-deteriorated, otherwise referred to herein as PCD, assets are defined as acquired individual financial assets (or acquired groups of financial assets with similar risk characteristics) that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Company&#8217;s assessment. The Company records acquired PCD loans by adding the expected credit losses (i.e., allowance for credit losses) to the purchase price of the financial assets rather than recording through the provision for credit losses in the income statement. The expected credit loss, as of the acquisition day, of a PCD loan is added to the allowance for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is the difference between the unpaid principal balance and the amortized cost basis as of the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the change in the ACL on PCD loans is recognized through the provision for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is accreted or amortized, respectively, into interest income over the remaining life of the PCD loan on a level-yield basis. In accordance with the transition requirements within the standard, the Company&#8217;s acquired credit-impaired loans (i.e., ACI or Purchased Credit Impaired) were treated as PCD loans. As a result of the merger with Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022, the Company identified approximately $137.9 million of loans as PCD and recorded an allowance for credit losses of $13.8 million on acquisition date. 

&#8203; 

Atlantic Capital was acquired and merged with and into the Bank on March 1, 2022, requiring that a closing date ACL be prepared for Atlantic Capital on a standalone basis and that the acquired portfolio be included in the Bank&#8217;s first quarter ACL. Atlantic Capital&#8217;s loans represented approximately 8% of the total Bank&#8217;s portfolio at March 31, 2022. Given the relative size and complexity of the acquired portfolio, similarities of the loan characteristics, and similar loss history to the existing portfolio, reserve calculations were performed using the Bank&#39;s existing CECL model, loan segmentation, and forecast weighting as the first quarter end reserve. The acquisition date ACL totaled $27.5 million, consisting of a non-PCD pooled reserve of $13.7 million, PCD pooled reserve of $5.7 million, and PCD individually evaluated reserve of $8.1 million. It represented about 8% of the combined Bank&#8217;s ACL reserve at March 31, 2022. The acquisition date reserve for unfunded commitments totaled $3.4 million, or 11% of the combined Bank&#8217;s total at March 31, 2022 .

&#8203; 

The Company follows its nonaccrual policy by reversing contractual interest income in the income statement when the Company places a loan on nonaccrual status. Therefore, management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on the portfolio and does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. As of March 31, 2023, the accrued interest receivable for loans recorded in Other Assets was $109.4 million. 

&#8203; 

The Company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an off-balance sheet exposure. These primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit. The expected losses associated with these exposures within the unfunded portion of the expected credit loss will be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. Management has determined that a majority of the Company&#8217;s off-balance-sheet credit exposures are not unconditionally cancellable. Management completes funding studies based on historical data to estimate the percentage of unfunded loan commitments that will ultimately be funded to calculate the reserve for unfunded commitments. Management applies this funding rate, along with the loss factor rate determined for each pooled loan segment, to unfunded loan commitments, excluding unconditionally cancellable exposures and letters of credit, to arrive at the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. As of March 31, 2023, the liability recorded for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments was $85.1 million. The current adjustment to the ACL for unfunded commitments is recognized through the Provision for Credit Losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income. The Company did not have an allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financials asset during 2023 and 2022. 

&#8203; 

As of March 31, 2023, the balance of the ACL was $370.6 million or 1.21% of total loans. The ACL increased $14.2 million from the balance of $356.4 million recorded at December 31, 2022. This increase during the first quarter of 2023 included a $15.2 million provision, in addition to $1.0 million in net charge-offs. 

&#8203; 

At March 31, 2023, the Company had a reserve on unfunded commitments of $85.1 million which was recorded as a liability on the balance sheet, compared to $67.2 million at December 31, 2022. During three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded an increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments of $17.9 million. This amount was recorded in Provision (Recovery) for Credit Losses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income. For the prior comparative period, the Company had a reserve on unfunded commitments of $30.4 million recorded at March 31, 2022. The Company did not have an allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financial asset during the first three months of 2023. 

&#160; 

The ACL provides 2.97 times coverage of nonperforming loans at March 31, 2023. Net charge-offs to the total average loans during three months ended March 31, 2023 were 0.01%, compared to 0.04% during the three months ended March 31, 2022. We continued to show solid and stable asset quality numbers and ratios as of March 31, 2023. The following table provides the allocation, by segment, for expected credit losses. Because PPP loans are government guaranteed and management implemented additional reviews and procedures to help mitigate potential losses, management does not expect to recognize credit losses on this loan portfolio and as a result, did not record an ACL for PPP loans within the C&#38;I loan segment presented in the table below. 

The following table presents a summary of the allowance for credit losses by loan segment, for the three months ended March 31,2023:

(1) Consists of real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure. (2) Consists of non-real estate foreclosed assets, such as repossessed vehicles. (3) Includes nonaccrual loans that are purchase credit deteriorated (PCD loans). (4) Loan data excludes mortgage loans held for sale. (5) For purposes of this calculation, total assets include all assets (both acquired and non-acquired). (6) Excludes non-acquired bank properties held for sale of $13.3 million, $14.3 million, $21.2 million, $1.4 million, and $893,000 as of March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet. (7) Excludes acquired bank properties held for sale of $3.4 million, $3.4 million, $3.9 million, $4.2 million, and $5.5 million as of March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet. &#8203; 

Total nonperforming assets were $128.3 million, or 0.42% of total loans and repossessed assets, at March 31, 2023, an increase of $18.6 million, or 16.9%, from December 31, 2022. Total nonperforming loans were $124.6 million, or 0.41%, of total loans, at March 31, 2023, an increase of $16.0 million, or 14.8%, from December 31, 2022. Non-acquired nonperforming loans increased by $23.8 million from December 31, 2022. The increase in non-acquired nonperforming loans was driven primarily by an increase in commercial nonaccrual loans of $23.6 million, an increase 

&#160; 

in consumer nonaccrual loans of $3.8 million, an increase in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $300,000, offset by a decline in restructured nonaccrual loans of $3.9 million. The increase in commercial nonaccrual loans at March 31, 2023 was primarily due to two relationships, one commercial owner occupied consisting of 3 loans, totaling $11.7 million, and one commercial and industrial consisting of 3 loans, totaling $12.3 million. Acquired nonperforming loans decreased $7.8 million from December 31, 2022. The increase in the acquired nonperforming loan balances was due primarily to a decrease in commercial nonaccrual loans of $2.1 million, a decrease in consumer nonaccrual loans of $2.0 million, a decrease in restructured loans of $2.6 million and a decline in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $1.0 million. The decline in restructured loans over both the nonacquired and acquired loan portfolios was due to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 effective January 1, 2023, which extinguishes the former troubled debt restructuring (TDR) guidance and issues new requirements for determining modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.

At March 31, 2023, OREO totaled $3.5 million, which included $58,000 in non-acquired OREO and $3.4 million in acquired OREO. Total OREO increased $2.5 million from December 31, 2022. At March 31, 2023, non-acquired OREO consisted of two properties with an average value of $29,000. This is compared to three properties with an average value of $47,000 at December 31, 2022. During the first quarter of 2023, we a did not add new property into non-acquired OREO, while selling one property during the quarter with an average value of $83,000. At March 31, 2023, acquired OREO consisted of four properties with an average value of $854,000, compared to three properties with an average value of $294,000 at December 31, 2022. In the first quarter of 2023, we added two new properties into acquired OREO, while selling one property with an aggregate value of $293,000 during the current quarter. On the properties sold, we recorded a net gain of $5,000. 

Potential Problem Loans 

&#8203; 

Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming loans, related to non-acquired loans were approximately $17.1 million, or 0.07%, of total non-acquired loans outstanding, at March 31, 2023, compared to $15.8 million, or 0.07%, of total non-acquired loans outstanding, at December 31, 2022. Potential problem loans related to acquired loans totaled $20.0 million, or 0.29%, of total acquired loans outstanding, at March 31, 2023, compared to $23.1 million, or 0.31% of total acquired loans outstanding, at December 31, 2022. All potential problem loans represent those loans where information about possible credit problems of the borrowers has caused management to have concern about the borrower&#8217;s ability to comply with present repayment terms. 

Interest-Bearing Liabilities 

&#8203; 

Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits, CDs, other time deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include NOW, HSA, IOLTA, and Market Rate checking accounts. 

&#8203; 

Total interest-bearing deposits increased $797.0 million or 13.9% annualized to $24.0 billion at March 31, 2023 from $23.2 billion at December 31, 2022. This increase was mainly driven by growth in time deposits of $1.7 billion including an increase in brokered time deposits of $1.2 billion. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, core deposits decreased $1.6 billion. These funds exclude certificates of deposits and other time deposits and are normally lower cost funds. Core deposits declined as customers moved their funds seeking higher yields as interest rates have risen along with some business customers moving funds for deposit insurance purposes. Federal funds purchases related to the correspondent bank division and repurchase agreements were $544.1 million at March 31, 2023, decreasing $12.3 million from December 31, 2022. Other borrowings, consisting of FHLB borrowings, increased to $900 million at March 31, 2023 from $0 at December 31, 2022. Corporate and subordinated debentures declined by $93,000 to $392.2 million. Some key highlights are outlined below: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; The increase in interest-bearing deposits from December 31, 2022 was driven by an increase in time deposits of $1.7 billion including an increase in brokered time deposits of $1.2 billion. The increase in time deposits was mostly offset by declines in interest bearing checking deposits of $639.5 million and savings deposits of $308.1 million. As customers moved funds from interest bearing checking and savings accounts, seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment and deposit insurance coverage , the Company increased its balance in brokered time deposits along with growth in in-market time deposits during the quarter. The Company raised interest rates on most interest-bearing deposit products (in particular time deposit specials) during the quarter due to competitive pressures to retain deposits. Average interest-bearing deposits decreased $441.3 billion to $23.3 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. For more information on the composition of our total deposits, see Note 10 &#8211; Deposits in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

&#9679; Other borrowings, consisting of FHLB borrowings, increased to $900 million at March 31, 2023 from $0 at December 31, 2022. The Company borrowed funds from the FHLB to provide excess liquidity during the first quarter of 2023. Noninterest-Bearing Deposits 

&#8203; 

Noninterest-bearing deposits are transaction accounts that provide our Bank with &#8220;interest-free&#8221; sources of funds. At March 31, 2023, the period end balance of noninterest-bearing deposits was $12.4 billion, a decrease of $746.1 million compared to $13.2 billion at the December 31, 2022. The decrease was mainly due to both customers seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment and deposit insurance coverage amid the financial turmoil during the quarter. Average noninterest-bearing deposits were $12.8 billion for the first quarter of 2022 compared to $12.3 billion for the first quarter of 2022. This increase was mainly related to deposits acquired through the Atlantic Capital transaction. The Atlantic Capital acquisition was completed on March 1, 2022, therefore the acquired noninterest-bearing deposits were only outstanding for 30 days during the first quarter 2022 which resulted in a lower effect on the average balance. 

Uninsured Deposits 

&#8203; 

At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $12.7 billion and $14.1 billion, respectively, in estimated uninsured deposits. Since it is not reasonably practicable to provide a precise measure of uninsured deposits, the amounts above are estimates and are based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank&#8217;s regulatory reporting requirements issued by the FDIC for the FFIEC 041, also referred to as the Call Report. The estimated balance of uninsured deposits of $12.7 billion at March 31, 2023 includes $1.8 billion of collateralized public funds bringing the net amount of estimated uninsured and unsecured deposits to $10.8 billion.

Capital Resources 

&#8203; 

Our ongoing capital requirements have been met primarily through retained earnings, less the payment of cash dividends. As of March 31, 2023, shareholders&#8217; equity was $5.2 billion, an increase of $174.1 million, or 3.4%, from December 31, 2022.

In January 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the 2021 Stock Repurchase Plan, which authorized the Company to repurchase 3,500,000 common shares. During the first quarter of 2022, we repurchased 1,012,038 shares, at an average price of $85.43 per share (excluding cost of commissions) for a total of $86.5 million under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Plan. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

In April 2022, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (&#8220;2022 Stock Repurchase Program&#8221;) authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 3,750,000 of the Company&#8217;s common shares along with the remaining authorized shares of 370,021 from the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program for a total authorization of 4,120,021 shares. The Company did not repurchase any shares through the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program during 2023. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of the purchases are based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of our common stock, and the availability of alternative investment opportunities. 

&#8203; 

We are subject to regulations with respect to certain risk-based capital ratios. These risk-based capital ratios measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks. The values of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are adjusted based on the rules to reflect categorical credit risk. In addition to the risk-based capital ratios, the regulatory agencies have also established a leverage ratio for assessing capital adequacy. The leverage ratio is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by total consolidated on-balance sheet assets (minus amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital). The leverage ratio does not involve assigning risk weights to assets. 

&#8203; 

Specifically, we are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios:

&#9679; a CET1, risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; &#9679; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; &#9679; a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and &#9679; a leverage ratio of 4%. 

Under the current capital rules, Tier 1 capital includes two components: CET1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The highest form of capital, CET1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, otherwise referred to as AOCI, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and Tier 1 minority interests. Tier 2 capital generally includes the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying preferred stock, subordinated debt, trust preferred securities and qualifying tier 2 minority interests, less any deductions in Tier 2 instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution. AOCI is presumptively included in CET1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. When the current capital rules were first implemented, the Bank exercised its one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI, allowing us to retain our pre-existing treatment for AOCI. 

In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a banking organization must maintain a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three risk-based measurements (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital), resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. 

The Bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized) and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three risk-based regulatory capital ratios (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital) and for the leverage ratio.

&#8203; 

The federal banking agencies revised their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the implementation of CECL&#894; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the adoption date adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL&#894; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing. CECL became effective for us on January 1, 2020 and the Company applied the provisions of the standard using the modified retrospective method as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. Related to the implementation of ASU 2016-13, we recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of $54.4 million, deferred tax assets of $12.6 million, an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of $6.4 million and an adjustment to retained earnings of $44.8 million. Instead of recognizing the effects on regulatory capital from ASU 2016-13 at adoption, the Company initially elected the option for recognizing the adoption date effects on the Company&#8217;s regulatory capital calculations over a three-year phase-in. 

&#160; 

In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations that adopt CECL in the 2020 calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by the aforementioned three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of benefit during the initial two-year delay for a total five-year transition. The estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital (modified CECL transitional amount) is calculated as the sum of the adoption date impact on retained earnings upon adoption of CECL (CECL transitional amount) and the calculated change in the ACL relative to the adoption date ACL upon adoption of CECL multiplied by a scaling factor of 25%. The scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the ACL under CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology. The Company chose the five-year transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from the adoption date and the CECL difference for the first two years of application. The modified CECL transitional amount was calculated each quarter for the first two years of the five-year transition. This amount was fixed as of December 31, 2021, and that amount began the three-year phase out in the first quarter of 2022 with 50% being phased out in 2023.

The Company&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios all increased compared to December 31, 2022. These ratios increased mainly due to net income during the quarter of $139.9 million. Tier 1 capital increased 2.7% and 2.2% at both the Company and Bank, respectively, with the increase in equity from net income. Total risk-based capital increased 3.6% and 3.4% at both the Company and Bank, respectively, with the increase in equity from net income along with the increase in the allowance for credit losses and unfunded commitments. Both regulatory risk-based assets and quarterly average assets remained reasonably flat compared to the fourth quarter with average assets for the Company and Bank decreasing 1.0% and risk-based assets increasing 1.1%. Our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory classification. Should the Company need to sell its available for sale and held to maturity securities for liquidity purposes and recognize the unrealized losses as of March 31, 2023 through earnings, all else equal, our capital ratios would remain well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory classification.

Liquidity 

&#8203; 

Liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations, which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits, extension of credit and payment of operating expenses. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank&#8217;s financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet its obligations. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring policies designed to ensure acceptable composition of our asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. We have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs. 

&#8203; 

Asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans, investment securities and other short-term investments. Management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and investments. Normally, changes in the earning asset mix are of a longer-term nature and are not used for day-to-day corporate liquidity needs. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Our liabilities provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, interest-bearing deposits at other banks and other short-term borrowings. We engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following: 

&#9679; Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our Bank; &#9679; Pricing deposits, including certificates of deposit, at rate levels that will attract and /or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our Bank&#8217;s asset/liability management and net interest margin requirements; and &#9679; Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our Bank&#8217;s appeal as a primary provider of financial services. Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by approximately $945.4 million, or approximately 16.8% annualized, compared to the balance at December 31, 2022. The increase from December 31, 2022 was mainly related to organic growth and renewals on acquired loans. The acquired loan portfolio decreased by $427.1 million from the balance at December 31, 2022 through principal paydowns, charge-offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans. 

Our investment securities portfolio (excluding trading securities) decreased $175.1 million compared to the balance at December 31, 2022. The decrease in investment securities from December 31, 2022 was a result of maturities, calls, sales and paydowns of investment securities totaling $306.4 million as well as a reduction from the n et amortization of premiums of $5.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio of $72.8 million and purchases of FHLB stock of $63.8 million. There were no purchases of available for sale or held to maturity securities during the quarter. Total cash and cash equivalents were $2.0 billion at March 31, 2023 as compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2022. This increase was due to the Company increasing its brokered time deposits by $1.2 billion and borrowing $900 million in FHLB borrowings during the quarter to increase liquidity. 

&#8203; 

At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $1.4 billion and $150.0 million of traditional, out&#8211;of&#8211;market brokered time deposits, respectively. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $765.5 million and $637.0 million, respectively, of reciprocal brokered deposits. Total deposits were $36.4 billion at March 31, 2023, an increase of $51.0 million from $36.4 billion at December 31, 2022 . This increase was driven by an increase in time deposits of $1.7 billion including an increase in brokered time deposits of $1.2 billion. The increase in time deposits was mostly offset by declines in noninterest bearing deposits of $746.1 million, in interest bearing checking deposits of $639.5 million and savings deposits of $308.1 million. As customers moved funds from noninterest bearing checking, interest bearing checking and savings accounts, seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment and deposit insurance coverage, the Company increased its balance in brokered time deposits and in in-market time deposits. The Company raised interest rates on most interest-bearing deposit products (in particular time deposit specials) during the quarter due to competitive pressures to retain deposits. Total corporate and subordinated debentures and other borrowings at March 31, 2023 were $1.3 billion and consisted of trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures of $392.2 million and FHLB borrowings of $900.0 million. The Company borrowed $2.2 billion during the quarter and repaid $1.3 billion prior to quarter-end in FHLB borrowings to increase liquidity. Total short-term borrowings at March 31, 2023 were $544.1 million, consisting of $233.4 million in federal funds purchased and $310.8 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. To the extent that we employ other types of non-deposit funding sources, typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers, we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds. Our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise. 

&#8203; 

Through the operations of our Bank, we have made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities. These commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to our customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time. We manage the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes. We believe that we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund commitments that are drawn upon by the borrowers. In addition to commitments to extend credit, we also issue standby letters of credit, which are assurances to third parties that they will not suffer a loss if our customer fails to meet its contractual obligation to the third-party. Although our experience indicates that many of these standby letters of credit will expire unused, through our various sources of liquidity, we believe that we will have the resources to meet these obligations should the need arise. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position, as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets, typically including some level of reverse repurchase agreements, federal funds sold, balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, and/or other short-term investments; asset quality; well-capitalized position; and profitable operating results. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our desired liquidity position at any time. We expect that these conditions would generally be of a short-term nature. Under such circumstances, we expect our reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds sold positions, or balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, if any, to serve as the primary source of immediate liquidity. We could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks and/or the FHLB . At March 31, 2023, our Bank had a total FHLB credit facility of $6.9 billion, with $900.0 million in FHLB advances and $2.1 million FHLB letters of credit outstanding at quarter-end, leaving $6.0 billion in availability on the FHLB credit facility. At March 31, 2023, our Bank had $2.5 billion of credit available at the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s discount window and federal funds credit lines of $300.0 million with no balances outstanding at quarter-end. The Bank also has an internal limit on brokered deposits of 15% of total deposits which would allow capacity of $5.5 billion at March 31, 2023. The Bank has $1.4 billion of outstanding brokered deposits at the end of the quarter leaving $4.1 billion in available capacity. All of these resources would provide an additional $12.9 billion in funding if we needed additional liquidity. The Bank also has $4.5 billion in unpledged securities at March 31, 2023 that can be pledge to attain additional funds if necessary. We can also consider actions such as deposit promotions to increase core deposits. The Company has a $100.0 million unsecured line of credit with U.S. Bank National Association with no balance outstanding at March 31, 2023. We believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available. 

&#8203; 

Our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on stressed liquidity levels. Liquidity key risk indicators are reported to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. We maintain various wholesale sources of funding. If our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful, we would use these alternative sources of funding. Under such circumstances, depending on the external source of funds, our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates charged. This could increase our cost of funds, impacting our net interest margin and net interest spread. 

Asset-Liability Management and Market Risk Sensitivity 

&#8203; 

Our earnings and the economic value of equity vary in relation to the behavior of interest rates and the accompanying fluctuations in market prices of certain of our financial instruments. We define interest rate risk as the risk to earnings and equity arising from the behavior of interest rates. These behaviors include increases and decreases in interest rates as well as continuation of the current interest rate environment. 

&#8203; 

Our interest rate risk principally consists of reprice, option, basis, and yield curve risk. Reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing characteristics of asset and liability portfolios. Option risk arises from embedded options in the investment and loan portfolios such as investment securities calls and loan prepayment options. Option risk also exists since deposit customers may withdraw funds at their discretion in response to general market conditions, competitive alternatives to existing accounts or other factors. The exercise of such options may result in higher costs or lower revenue. Basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices, which subsequently result in narrowing spreads on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Basis risk also exists in administered rate liabilities, such as interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts where the price sensitivity of such products may vary relative to general markets rates. Yield curve risk refers to adverse consequences of nonparallel shifts in the yield curves of various market indices that impact our assets and liabilities. 

&#8203; 

We use simulation analysis as a primary method to assess earnings at risk and equity at risk due to assumed changes in interest rates. Management uses the results of its various simulation analyses in combination with other data and observations to formulate strategies designed to maintain interest rate risk within risk tolerances. 

&#8203; 

Simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including, but not limited to, the timing of cash flows such as the terms of contractual agreements, investment security calls, loan prepayment speeds, deposit attrition rates, the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates, and the behavior of interest rates and spreads. Equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows. Simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes. Key simulation assumptions are subject to sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk. Model assumptions are reviewed by our Assumptions Committee. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Earnings at risk is defined as the percentage change in net interest income due to assumed changes in interest rates. Earnings at risk is generally used to assess interest rate risk over relatively short time horizons. 

Equity at risk is defined as the percentage change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value. The discounted present value of all cash flows represents our economic value of equity. Equity at risk is generally considered a measure of the long-term interest rate exposures of the balance sheet at a point in time. 

&#8203; 

The earnings simulation models take into account our contractual agreements with regard to investments, loans, deposits, borrowings, and derivatives as well as a number of behavioral assumptions applied to certain assets and liabilities. 

&#8203; 

Mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist of forward sales contracts and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans. These derivatives involve underlying items, such as interest rates, and are designed to mitigate risk. Derivatives are also used to hedge mortgage servicing rights. For additional information see Note 28&#8212;Derivative Financial Instruments in the consolidated financial statements. 

&#8203; 

From time to time, we execute interest rate swaps to hedge some of our interest rate risks. Under these arrangements, the Company enters into a variable rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement. The swap agreement effectively converts the client&#8217;s variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan. The Company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a third-party dealer to offset its exposure on the customer swap. The Company may also execute interest rate swap agreements that are not specific to client loans. As of March 31, 2023, the Company did not have such agreements. For additional information on these derivatives refer to Note 28&#8212;Derivative Financial Instruments in the consolidated financial statements. 

&#8203; 

Our interest rate risk key indicators are applied to a static balance sheet using forward rates from the Moody&#8217;s Baseline Scenario. The Company will also use other rate forecasts, including, but not limited to, Moody&#8217;s Consensus Scenario. This Base Case Scenario assumes the maturity composition of asset and liability rollover volumes is modeled to approximately replicate current consolidated balance sheet characteristics throughout the simulation. These treatments are consistent with the Company&#8217;s goal of assessing current interest rate risk embedded in its current balance sheet. The Base Case Scenario assumes that maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at prices referencing forward rates derived from the selected rate forecast consistent with current balance sheet pricing characteristics. Key rate drivers are used to price assets and liabilities with sensitivity assumptions used to price non-maturity deposits. The sensitivity assumptions for the pricing of non-maturity deposits are subjected to sensitivity analysis no less frequently than on an annual basis. 

&#8203; 

Interest rate shocks are applied to the Base Case on an instantaneous basis. Our policy establishes the use of upward and downward interest rate shocks applied in 100 basis point increments through 400 basis points. We calculate smaller rate shocks as needed. At times, market conditions may result in assumed rate movements that will be deemphasized. For example, during a period of ultra-low interest rates, certain downward rate shocks may be impractical. The model simulation results produced from the Base Case Scenario and related instantaneous shocks for changes in net interest income and changes in the economic value of equity are referred to as the Core Scenario Analysis and constitute the policy key risk indicators for interest rate risk when compared to risk tolerances. 

&#8203; 

During the second quarter of 2022, management revised its deposit beta assumptions higher due to the rapid increase in interest rates and expected further increases. From the beginning of the upward rate cycle, our deposit costs have increased from five basis points to seventy basis points. During this period, the federal funds rate has increased 475 basis points. Accordingly, our cycle to date beta has been approximately 14.7%. Management recognizes the difficulty using historical data to forecast deposit betas in the current environment. For internal purposes, we are assuming a beta of 28.0% with a terminal federal funds rate of 5.25% and a corresponding cumulative rate increase of 500 basis points. 

The following interest rate risk metrics are derived from analysis using the Moody&#8217;s Consensus Scenario published in April 2023 as the Base Case. As of March 31, 2023, the earnings simulations indicated that the year 1 impact of an instantaneous 100 basis point increase / decrease in rates would result in an estimated 2.1% increase (up 100) and 2.9% decrease (down 100) in net interest income. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

We use Economic Value of Equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) analysis as an indicator of the extent to which the present value of our capital could change, given potential changes in interest rates. This measure also assumes a static balance sheet (Base Case Scenario) with rate shocks applied as described above. At March 31, 2023, the percentage change in EVE due to a 100-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates was 1.6% decrease and 0.7% decrease, respectively. The percentage changes in EVE due to a 200-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates were 4.3% decrease and 3.8% decrease, respectively. The interest rate shock analysis results for EVE sensitivities are unusual as the benefits of repricing assets are mitigated by increasing deposit costs, and downward shocks are constrained on various balance sheet categories due to the inability to price products below floors or zero. This is particularly meaningful given the cost of deposits as of March 31, 2023. 

&#8203; 

The analysis below reflects a Base Case and shocked scenarios that assume a static balance sheet projection where volume is added to maintain balances consistent with current levels, except for PPP loans that are not assumed to be replaced. Base Case assumes new and repricing volumes reference forward rates derived from the Moody&#8217;s Consensus rate forecast. Instantaneous, parallel, and sustained interest rate shocks are applied to the Base Case scenario over a one-year time horizon.

LIBOR Transition 

While most LIBOR settings ceased to be provided or were no longer representative after December 31, 2021, for the most common tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, the administrator of LIBOR extended publication until June 30, 2023. 

&#8203; 

The Alternative Reference Rates Committee proposed Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) as its preferred rate as an alternative to LIBOR and proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR. Organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. As noted within Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Form 10-K for the year ended 2022, we hold instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR including floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and hedges, and other financial instruments but is not able to currently predict the associated financial impact of the transition to an alternative reference rate. 

&#8203; 

We have established a cross-functional LIBOR transition working group that has (1) assessed the Company&#39;s current exposure to LIBOR indexed instruments and the data, systems and processes that will be impacted; (2) established a detailed implementation plan; and (3) developed a formal governance structure for the transition. The Company has developed and continues to implement various proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of customers, which include: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; The adoption and ongoing implementation of fallback provisions that provide for the determination of replacement rates for LIBOR-linked financial products. &#9679; The adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, consistent with guidance provided by the U.S. regulators, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, and GSEs. &#9679; The selection of SOFR indices as the replacement indices, and successful completion of systems testing using the SOFR replacement indices. &#8203; 

We intend to use the provisions of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act passed by Congress and signed in to law by the President in March 2022 for certain contracts referencing LIBOR. The Act provides for the use of SOFR as the replacement index with a spread adjustment when the remaining LIBOR indices are discontinued. The Act applies when there is no contract provision addressing the loss of LIBOR and may be used otherwise as well, provided the contract does not provide for a specific replacement index. This aligns with the plan of action currently under implementation by the Company. The final rule implementing the Act was released on December 22, 2022. 

&#160; 

The Company continues to evaluate its financial and operational infrastructure in its effort to transition all financial and strategic processes, systems, and models to reference rates other than LIBOR. The Company is in the process of developing and implementing processes to educate client-facing associates and coordinate communications with customers regarding the transition. A townhall meeting with commercial relationship managers was held in advance of letters to commercial borrowers regarding LIBOR retirement. Letters to consumer and mortgage borrowers were also mailed. Training and other resources for use by lenders and customer care representatives have been provided. 

&#8203; 

As of March 31, 2023, the Company had the following exposures to LIBOR: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Approximately $4.9 billion of total outstanding loans referencing LIBOR. Of this amount, $4.8 billion have maturities occurring after the LIBOR discontinuation date of June 30, 2023. 

&#9679; Approximately $14.7 billion in interest rate swaps that are indexed to LIBOR with a gross positive fair value of $130.1 million, inclusive of $650.0 million of variation margin settlements, and a gross negative fair value of $619.3 million. However, the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. Therefore, the transition to LIBOR will have no hedge accounting impact as changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. Moreover, the exposure of both sides of these swaps is presented in these figures. These exposures are intended to offset each other. 

&#9679; Trust preferred securities that reference LIBOR and had a total principal balance of $118.6 million. These securities have maturities ranging from October 7, 2033 through March 14, 2037. Deposit and Loan Concentrations 

&#8203; 

We have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers. We have no significant portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries. Furthermore, we attempt to avoid making loans that, in an aggregate amount, exceed 10% of total loans to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities. As of March 31, 2023, there were no aggregated loan concentrations of this type. We do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us. We do not have any foreign loans or deposits. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

&#8203; 

Each category of earning assets has a certain degree of credit risk. We use various techniques to measure credit risk. Credit risk in the investment portfolio can be measured through bond ratings published by independent agencies. In the investment securities portfolio, the investments consist of U.S. government-sponsored entity securities, tax-free securities, or other securities having ratings of &#8220;AAA&#8221; to &#8220;Not Rated&#8221;. All securities, with the exception of those that are not rated, were rated by at least one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. The credit risk of the loan portfolio can be measured by historical experience. We maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with credit policies that we have established. Although the Bank has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of our borrowers&#8217; abilities to honor their contracts is dependent upon economic conditions within our geographic footprint and the surrounding regions. 

We consider concentrations of credit to exist when, pursuant to regulatory guidelines, the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents 25% of total Tier 1 capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses of the Company, or $1.1 billion at March 31, 2023. Based on this criteria, we had seven such credit concentrations at March 31, 2023, including loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings (except mini-warehouses) of $5.9 billion, loans secured by owner occupied office buildings (including medical office buildings) of $1.9 billion, loans secured by owner occupied nonresidential buildings (excluding office buildings) of $1.8 billion, loans to lessors of residential buildings (investment properties and multi-family) of $2.0 billion, loans secured by 1st mortgage 1-4 family owner occupied residential property (including condos and home equity lines) of $7.2 billion, loans secured by jumbo (original loans greater than $548,250) of $2.1 billion, and loans secured by business assets including accounts receivable, inventory and equipment of $2.1 billion. The risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time. The loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard ACL methodology. 

&#160; 

After the adoption of CECL in the first quarter of 2020, banking regulators established guidelines for calculating credit concentrations. Banking regulators set the guidelines for construction, land development and other land loans to total less than 100% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CDL concentration ratio) and for total commercial real estate loans (construction, land development and other land loans along with other non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans) to total less than 300% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CRE concentration ratio). Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank&#8217;s total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Bank&#8217;s CDL concentration ratio was 60.6% and 64.8%, respectively, and its CRE concentration ratio was 243.5% and 249.0%, respectively. As of March 31, 2023, the Bank was below the established regulatory guidelines. When a bank&#8217;s ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines, banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by Bank management. Therefore, we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes. 

R econciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP 

&#8203; 

The return on average tangible equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the effect of the average balance of intangible assets and adds back the after-tax amortization of intangibles to GAAP basis net income. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information that is useful to investors in evaluating our performance and capital and may facilitate comparisons with other institutions in the banking industry as well as period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider the Company&#8217;s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, are not audited, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled financial measures used by other companies. Investors should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company&#8217;s results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.
