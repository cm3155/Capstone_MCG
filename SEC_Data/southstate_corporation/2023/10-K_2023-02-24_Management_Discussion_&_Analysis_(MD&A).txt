Introduction 

The following Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) describes SouthState Corporation and its subsidiary&#8217;s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, and the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, and also analyzes our financial condition as of December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021. Like most banking institutions, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on most of which we pay interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is the amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest- bearing liabilities, such as deposits. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. 

There are risks inherent in all loans, so we maintain an allowance for credit losses to absorb our estimate of probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. We establish and maintain this allowance by recording a provision or recovery for credit losses against our earnings. In the following section, we have included a detailed discussion of this process. 

In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers. We incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings, the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits. We describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion. 

The following section also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other information included in this Report. 

Overview 

SouthState Corporation is a financial holding company headquartered in Winter Haven, Florida, and was incorporated under the laws of South Carolina in 1985. We provide a wide range of banking services and products to our customers through our Bank. The Bank operates SouthState|Duncan-Williams, a registered broker-dealer headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, which it acquired on February 1, 2021 that serves primarily institutional clients across the U.S. in the fixed income business. The Bank also operates SouthState Advisory, Inc., a wholly owned registered investment advisor, and CBI Holding Company, LLC (&#8220;CBI&#8221;), which in turn owns Corporate Billing, a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers nationwide. The holding company also owns SSB Insurance Corp., a captive insurance subsidiary pursuant to Section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code. 

&#8203; 

At December 31, 2022, we had $43.9 billion in assets and 5,029 full- time equivalent employees. Through our Bank branches, ATMs and online banking platforms, we provide our customers with a wide range of financial products and services, through a six (6) state footprint in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. These financial products and services include deposit accounts such as checking accounts, savings and time deposits of various types, safe deposit boxes, bank money orders, wire transfer and ACH services, brokerage services and alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds, trust and asset management services, loans of all types, including business loans, agriculture loans, real estate-secured (mortgage) loans, personal use loans, home improvement loans, automobile loans, manufactured housing loans, boat loans, credit cards, letters of credit, home equity lines of credit, treasury management services, and merchant services. 

&#8203; 

We also operate a correspondent banking and capital markets division within our national bank subsidiary, of which the majority of its bond salesmen, traders and operational personnel are housed in facilities located in Atlanta, Georgia, Memphis, Tennessee, Walnut Creek, California, and Birmingham, Alabama. This division&#8217;s primary revenue generating activities are related to its capital markets division, which includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities; and its correspondent banking division, which includes spread income earned on correspondent bank deposits (i.e., federal funds purchased) and correspondent bank checking account deposits and fees from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services for correspondents, asset/liability consulting related activities, international wires, and other clearing and corporate checking account services. The correspondent banking and capital markets division was expanded with the Bank&#8217;s acquisition of SouthState|Duncan-Williams. 

&#8203; 

We earned net income of $496.0 million, or $6.60 diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;), during 2022 compared to net income of $475.5 million, or $6.71 diluted EPS, in 2021. Net income available to the common shareholders was up $20.5 million, or 4.3%, in 2022 compared to 2021. For further discussion of the Company&#8217;s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, and the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, see Results of Operations section of this MD&#38;A starting on page 55. 

&#8203; 

At December 31, 2022, we had total assets of approximately $43.9 billion compared to approximately $41.8 billion at December 31, 2021. See the Financial Condition section of this MD&#38;A starting on page 66 for a more detailed description of the change in our balance sheet. 

&#8203; 

Our asset quality results remained strong in December 31, 2022, net charge offs as a percentage of average loans increased slightly to 0.02% compared to 0.01% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The total nonperforming assets (&#8220;NPAs&#8221;) increased $26.0 million to $109.7 million at December 31, 2022 from $83.7 million at December 31, 2021. Acquired NPAs increased $2.6 million to $62.5 million at December 31, 2022 from $59.8 million at December 31, 2021. Acquired nonperforming loans increased $4.6 million and acquired OREO and other nonperforming assets decreased $2.0 million. Non-acquired NPAs increased $23.4 million to $47.3 million at December 31, 2022 from $23.9 million at December 31, 2021, which was related to an increase in non-acquired 

nonperforming loans of $23.7 million. Non-acquired OREO and other NPAs declined by $345,000 to $245,000 as of December 31, 2022 compared to $590,000 as of December 31, 2021. The total NPAs as a percentage of total assets increased 5 basis points to 0.25% at December 31, 2022 as compared to 0.20% at December 31, 2021. 

&#8203; 

Our efficiency ratio was 54.2% at December 31, 2022 compared to 65.5% at December 31, 2021. The improvement in our efficiency ratio was due to both the effects of a 2.0% decrease in noninterest expense and the 18.6% increase in the total of tax-equivalent (&#8220;TE&#8221;) net interest income and noninterest income. The Company&#8217;s net interest income has increased significantly in 2022 with the current rising rate environment. 

&#8203; 

We continue to remain well-capitalized with a total risk-based capital ratio of 13.0% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.7%, as of December 31, 2022, compared to 13.6% and 8.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2021. The total risk-based capital ratio decreased due to the additional risk-weighted assets acquired through the acquisition of Atlantic Capital in the first quarter of 2022, which on average, had a higher risk weighting, the reduction in cash and cash equivalents during the year, which are lower risk weighted assets, and due to the organic growth in loans during 2022, which have a higher risk weighting. The effects on our ratios from the increase in risk-weighted assets were partially offset by an increase in total risk-based capital due to net income recognized in 2022, the addition to the net equity of $657.8 million issued for the Atlantic Capital acquisition and the $75.0 million in subordinated debentures assumed from Atlantic Capital that qualify as Tier 2 risk-based capital. These increases in capital were partially offset by the $119.3 million of stock repurchases completed during 2022, including shares withheld for taxes pertaining to the vesting of equity awards, along with the dividend paid to shareholders of $146.5 million and the redemption of $13.0 million of subordinated debentures on June 30, 2022. The Tier 1 leverage ratios for both the Company and Bank increased compared to December 31, 2021, as the percentage increase in Tier 1 capital was greater than the percentage increase in average assets during 2022, due mainly to net income and equity issued in the Atlantic Capital acquisition. We believe our current capital ratios position us well to grow both organically and through certain strategic opportunities. For further discussion of the Company&#8217;s financial condition as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021, see Financial Condition section of this MD&#38;A starting on page 66. 

Recent Events 

Atlantic Capital Bancshares, Inc. Merger 

On March 1, 2022, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Atlantic Capital in a stock transaction. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Atlantic Capital merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger. Immediately following the merger, Atlantic Capital&#8217;s wholly owned banking subsidiary, Atlantic Capital Bank, N.A. (&#8220;ACB&#8221;) merged with and into the Bank, the surviving bank in the bank merger. 

&#8203; 

Shareholders of Atlantic Capital received 0.36 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock for each share of Atlantic Capital common stock they owned. In total, the purchase price for Atlantic Capital was $657.8 million. 

&#8203; 

In the acquisition, the Company acquired $2.4 billion of loans, including Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) loans, at fair value, net of $54.3 million, or 2.24%, estimated discount to the outstanding principal balance, representing 10.0% of the Company&#8217;s total loans at December 31, 2021. Of the total loans acquired, management identified $137.9 million that had more than insignificantly deteriorated since origination and were thus determined to be PCD loans. Additional details regarding the Atlantic Capital merger are discussed in Note 2 &#8212; Mergers and Acquisitions. 

&#8203; 

Branch Consolidation and Other Cost Initiatives 

&#8203; 

As a part of the ongoing evaluation of customer service delivery and efficiencies, the Company consolidated 32 branch locations in the third and fourth quarters of 2022. The annual savings in 2023 of these closures, which primarily includes personnel, facilities, and equipment cost, is expected to be $12.0 million, and the impact in 2022 was approximately $3.5 million. These consolidated locations were in Florida, South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

Capital Management 

&#8203; 

On June 7, 2022, the Company received Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s supervisory nonobjection on the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program, which was previously approved by the Board of Directors of the Company in April 2022, contingent upon receipt of such supervisory nonobjection. The aggregate number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to repurchase totaled 4,120,021 million shares, which includes 370,021 shares remaining from the Company&#8217;s 2021 Stock Repurchase Plan. During 2022, the Company did not repurchase any shares pursuant to the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program. During the first quarter of 2022, before the approval of the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program, the Company repurchased a total of 1,312,038 shares at a weighted average price of $83.99 per share pursuant to the 2021 Stock Repurchase Plan. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and follow general practices within the banking industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by management&#8217;s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements. 

The following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.

Business Combinations 

&#8203; 

We account for acquisitions under FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations , which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, and liabilities assumed, are recorded at fair value. We adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , on January 1, 2020 which now requires us to record purchased financial assets with credit deterioration (PCD assets), defined as a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination or issuance, at the purchase price plus the allowance for credit losses expected at the time of acquisition. Under this method, there is no provision for credit losses affecting net income on acquisition of PCD assets. Changes in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for credit loss expense (or recovery of credit losses) in subsequent periods as they arise. Any non-credit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets with credit deterioration shall be allocated to each individual asset. At the acquisition date, the initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis shall be allocated to individual assets to appropriately allocate any non-credit discount or premium. The non-credit discount or premium, after the adjustment for the allowance for credit losses, shall be accreted into interest income using the interest method based on the effective interest rate determined after the adjustment for credit losses at the adoption date. 

&#8203; 

A purchased financial asset that does not qualify as a PCD asset is accounted for similar to an originated financial asset. Generally, this means that an entity recognizes the allowance for credit losses for non-PCD assets through net income at the time of acquisition. In addition, both the credit discount and non-credit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets that do not qualify as PCD assets shall be allocated to each individual asset. This combined discount or premium shall be accreted into interest income using the effective yield method. 

&#8203; 

For further discussion of our loan accounting and acquisitions, see Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 2&#8212;Mergers and Acquisitions, Note 4&#8212;Loans and Note 5&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses to the audited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

&#8203; 

Allowance for Credit Losses or ACL 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses that will result from the inability of our 

borrowers to make required loan payments. Management used the systematic methodology to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, management&#8217;s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion. The Company&#8217;s ACL recorded on the balance sheet reflects management&#8217;s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses. See Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL. See also Note 5&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses and &#8220;Provision for Credit Losses&#8221; in this MD&#38;A. 

&#8203; 

Other Real Estate Owned and Bank Property Held For Sale 

&#8203; 

Other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;) consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans. Both OREO and bank property held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and the fair value was determined on the basis of current valuations obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. At the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral, for OREO, any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the ACL. At the time a bank property is no longer in service and is moved to held for sale, any excess of the current book value over fair value is recorded as Noninterest Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Subsequent adjustments to this value are described below in the following paragraph. 

&#8203; 

We report subsequent declines in the fair value of OREO and bank properties held for sale below the new cost basis through valuation adjustments. Significant judgment and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of these properties, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility. In response to market conditions and other economic factors, management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy. As a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from the current valuations used to determine the fair value of these properties. Management reviews the value of these properties periodically and adjusts the values as appropriate. Revenue and expenses from OREO operations, as well as gains or losses on sales and any subsequent adjustments to the value are recorded as OREO Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Gains or losses on sale of bank properties held for sale, and generally any subsequent write-downs to the value, are recorded as a component in Other Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

&#8203; 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in a business combination. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the balance of goodwill was $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset&#8217;s fair value. 

&#8203; 

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment for all entities by requiring impairment charges to be based on Step 1 of the previous accounting guidance&#8217;s two-step impairment test under ASC Topic 350. Under the new guidance, if a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The new standard eliminates the requirement to calculate a goodwill impairment charge using Step 2 which involved calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment. The standard does not change the guidance on completing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity will still be able to perform today&#8217;s optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment before proceeding to the quantitative step of determining whether the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount exceeds it fair value. 

&#8203; 

We evaluated the carrying value of goodwill as of October 31, 2022, our annual test date, and determined that 

no impairment charge was necessary. Our stock price has historically traded above its book value. On December 31, 2022, our stock price closed at $76.36, which is above the book value of $67.04 and tangible book value of $40.09. The lowest trading price for our stock during 2022 was $72.26, which was above year-end book value and tangible book value. Based upon our internal valuation and analysis as of October 31, 2022, we determined that no impairment charge was necessary at this time. We will continue to monitor the impact of current economic conditions and other events on the Company&#8217;s business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. If the current economic conditions and other events were to deteriorate and our stock price falls below current levels, we will have to reevaluate the impact on our financial condition and potential impairment of goodwill. 

&#8203; 

Core deposit intangibles and client list intangibles consist primarily of amortizing assets established during the acquisition of other banks. This includes whole bank acquisitions and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities from other financial institutions. Core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of long-term deposit relationships acquired in these transactions. Client list intangibles represent the value of long-term client relationships for the correspondent banking and wealth and trust management business. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives, such as deposit accounts in the case of core deposit intangible, on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from this intangible. The estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness. 

Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets 

&#8203; 

Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in our consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of certain assets and liabilities, including loans, available for sale securities, ACL, write downs of OREO properties and bank properties held for sale, accumulated depreciation, net operating loss carry forwards, accretion income, deferred compensation, intangible assets, mortgage servicing rights, and post-retirement benefits. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that a deferred tax asset is not realizable. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Additionally, income tax returns are filed by the Company or its subsidiaries in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia and city of New York City. We evaluate the need for income tax reserves related to uncertain income tax positions but had no material reserves at December 31, 2022 or 2021. 

Recent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements 

For information relating to recent accounting standards and pronouncements, see Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements entitled &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.&#8221;

Results of Operations 

Consolidated net income available to common shareholders increased by $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase reflects an increase in interest income and a decrease in noninterest expense. Partially offsetting these positive effects on net income was an increase in provision for credit losses, a decrease in noninterest income, an increase in interest expense, and an increase in the provision for income taxes. Below are key highlights of our results of operations during 2022: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Consolidated net income available to common shareholders increased 4.3% to $496.0 million in 2022 compared to $475.5 million in 2021, and increased $375.4 million, or 311.2%, compared to $120.6 million in 2020. ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START o Increased interest income of $312.2 million, resulting from a $187.5 million increase in interest income from loans and loans held for sale, a $84.6 million increase in interest income from investment securities, and a $40.1 million increase in interest income on federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreement to resell and interest-bearing deposits. These increases were mainly due to the increase in yields in all categories of interest-earning assets in the current rising rate environment as the Federal Reserve Bank has ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START raised it federal funds rate 425 basis points in 2022. The increase in interest income is also due to the increase in the average balance of both loans, through organic loan growth and loans acquired through the Atlantic Capital acquisition, and investment securities, from the retained portion of the investment securities acquired from Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022, along with the strategic decision to increase the investment securities portfolio in 2022; ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START o Increased interest expense of $9.7 million, which resulted from a $3.8 million increase in interest expense from deposits, a $3.3 million increase in interest expense in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, a $2.6 million increase in interest expense from corporate and subordinated debentures and other borrowings. These increases were primarily due to an increase in average costs in the current rising rate environment along with a $1.7 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits, primarily due to the interest-bearing deposits of $1.6 billion assumed from the Atlantic Capital acquisition on March 1, 2022; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Decreased noninterest income of $45.0 million, which resulted primarily from a $46.8 million decline in mortgage banking income, a $31.3 million decrease in correspondent banking and capital markets income, and a $1.1 million decrease in other noninterest income. These decreases were offset by a $16.2 million increase in service charges on deposit accounts, a $6.4 million increase in debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income, a $5.9 million increase in Bank Owned Life Insurance (&#8220;BOLI&#8221;) income, a $3.8 million increase in SBA income, and a $2.0 million increase in trust and investment services income (See Noninterest Income section on page 61 for further discussion); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Decreased noninterest expense of $18.7 million, which resulted primarily from a $36.4 million decrease in merger and branch consolidation related expense, extinguishment of debt cost of $11.7 million pertaining to the redemption of $38.5 million in trust preferred securities completed during the second quarter of 2021, and a $2.7 million decrease in occupancy expense. These decreases were partially offset by a $13.7 million increase in other noninterest expense, a $5.3 million increase in information services expense, a $5.1 million increase in FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges, a $4.7 million increase in professional fees, a $3.5 million increase in business development and staff related expense, and a $2.7 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense (See Noninterest Expense section on page 64 for further discussion); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o A $247.1 million increase in the provision for allowance for credit losses, as the Company recorded provision for credit losses of $81.9 million in 2022 while recording a release of the allowance for credit losses of $165.3 million in 2021; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Higher income tax provision of $8.6 million primarily due to the change in pretax book income between the two years. The Company recorded pretax book income of $633.4 million in 2022 compared to pretax book income of $604.3 million in 2021 The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate was 21.68% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 21.30% for the year ended December 31, 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Basic earnings per common share decreased 1.6% to $6.65 in 2022, from $6.76 in 2021 and increased 202.3% from $2.20 in 2020. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Diluted earnings per common share decreased 1.6% to $6.60 in 2022, from $6.71 in 2021, and increased 201.4% from $2.19 in 2020. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#9679; Return on average assets was 1.12% in 2022, a decrease compared to 1.19% in 2021 and an increase compared to 0.42% in 2020. The decrease in 2022 compared to 2021 was driven by the increase in total average assets of 11.6%, or $4.6 billion, to $44.5 billion in 2022 being greater than the increase in net income of 4.3%, or $20.5 million, to $496.0 million. The increase in average assets was mainly due to both increases in loans and investment securities through both the Atlantic Capital acquisition and organic growth. The increase in 2021 compared to 2020 was driven by the growth in net income of 294.2%, or $354.9 million, to $475.5 million being greater than the increase in total average assets of 38.5%, or $11.1 billion, to $39.8 billion in 2021, mainly related to the full year impact in 2021 from the merger with CenterState completed during the second quarter of 2020 along with the change in the provision for credit losses as the Company had a release of provision of $165.3 million in 2021 compared to provision of $236.0 million in 2020. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity decreased to 9.84% in 2022, compared to 10.01% in 2021, and an increase from 3.35% in 2020. The decrease in 2022 compared to 2021 was driven by the higher growth in average common shareholders&#8217; equity of 6.1%, or $291.4 million 2021 compared to the growth in net income ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START of 4.3%, or $20.5 million, to $496.0 million. The increase in 2021 compared to 2020 was driven by the greater growth in net income of 294.2%, or $354.9 million, to $475.5 million compared to an increase in average common shareholders&#8217; equity of 31.7%, or $1.1 billion, in 2021. As mentioned above, the increase in net income in 2021 was mainly due to a full year&#8217;s impact from the merger with CenterState, along with the reversals of provision for credit losses in 2021 resulting from improved economic forecasts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#9679; Our dividend payout ratio was 29.54% for 2022 compared with 28.43% in 2021 and 81.45% in 2020. The increase in the dividend payout ratio in 2022 compared to 2021 was due to the increase in total dividends paid during 2022 of 8.3%, or $11.3 million being greater than the increase in net income available to common shareholders, which increased 4.3%. The decrease in the dividend payout ratio in 2021 compared to 2020 was due to the growth in net income available to common shareholders, which increased 294.2%, being greater than the increase in dividends paid of 37.7%, or $37.1 million. ##TABLE_END 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the largest component of our net income. Net interest income is the difference between income earned on interest- earning assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is determined by the yields earned on interest-earning assets, rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, the relative balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the degree of mismatch, and the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest- bearing liabilities. Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets represents our net interest margin. 

In March of 2020, the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2022, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates one time by 25 basis points, two times by 50 basis points, and four times by 75 basis points from a range of 0.00% to 0.25% to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. As a result, the Company operated under an increasing rate environment for the majority of 2022. 

2022 compared to 2021 

Net interest income and net interest margin are highlighted for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021:

##TABLE_START &#9679; Both the non-tax equivalent and the tax equivalent net interest margin increased by 45 basis points in 2022 compared to 2021. While the yield on interest-earning assets increased 45 basis points, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities marginally increased 3 basis points. The increase in the net interest margin was primarily due to the rising rate environment in effect during 2022 as our interest-earning assets have repriced more quickly than our interest-bearing liabilities. The increase was also due to a change in asset mix as the lower yielding interest-bearing deposit and federal funds sold declined in 2022, while our higher yielding loan portfolio and investments increased. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Overall, our yield on interest-earning assets in 2022 increased 45 basis points from 2021, primarily due to higher yields on all interest-earning assets as the Federal Reserve Bank raised interest rates 425 basis points starting late in first quarter of 2022 . The increases in interest rates, in combination with the increase in the average balance of the higher yielding loan portfolio of $3.3 billion and the investment portfolio of $2.7 billion, along with the decline in the average balance of lower yielding interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold of $1.6 billion, affected the overall yield increase between the comparable periods. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2022 compared to 2021 increased 3 basis points. This increase was driven by the effects from the rising rate environment on the repricing of variable rate products, including interest-bearing and savings deposits, federal funds purchased and trust preferred corporate debt. The cost of interest-bearing and savings deposits increased 5 basis points, while the cost of federal funds purchased increased 126 basis points and the cost of corporate and subordinated debentures increased 12 basis points. Overall, interest-bearing deposits have been slower to reprice in the rising rate environment. ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Our net interest income increased by $302.5 million, or 29.3%, to $1.3 billion during 2022, compared to 2021, as interest income increased $312.2 million and interest expense only increased $9.7 million. ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START o Our interest income increased by $312.2 million due to - ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9726; Higher non-acquired loan interest income of $235.2 million due to a higher average balance of $5.0 billion, higher investment securities interest income of $84.6 million because of a higher average balance of $2.7 billion, and higher federal funds sold and repurchase agreements interest income of $40.1 million due to the rising rate environment in effect during the current year even though the average balance was lower by $1.6 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9726; These increases in interest income were partially offset by lower interest income on acquired loans of $43.6 million due to a lower average balance of $1.6 billion resulting from paydowns, pay-offs and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. Interest income on loans held for sale also declined by $4.1 million due to a lower average balance of $177.9 million. ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START o Our interest expense increased by of $9.7 million in 2022 compared to 2021 due to &#8211; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9726; Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increasing $3.8 million because of a slight increase in the average cost of 1 basis point along with a $1.7 billion increase in the average balance, interest expense on federal funds purchased increasing $3.3 million because of an increase in the average cost of 126 basis points, and interest expense related to other borrowings increasing $2.6 million because of an increase in the average cost of 14 basis points. ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Average interest-earning assets increased $4.3 billion, or 12.0%, to $39.9 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The increase in the average balance on non-acquired loan portfolio of $5.0 billion was due to organic growth and renewals of matured acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The decrease in the average balance on the acquired loan portfolio of $1.6 billion was due to paydowns, pay-offs and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The increase in the average balance in investment securities of $2.7 billion was a result of the Bank using a portion of the excess funds to increase the size of its investment securities, along with the Bank&#8217;s strategy on replacing lower yielding securities with higher yielding securities as interest rates started to increase in the first quarter of 2022, in addition to retaining a portion of the investment securities acquired from Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022. The excess liquidity was from the growth in deposits in 2021 and during the first half of 2022. ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $1.6 billion, or 6.8%, to $24.8 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $1.7 billion, primarily due to the interest-bearing deposits of $1.6 billion assumed from the Atlantic Capital acquisition on March 1, 2022. The average balance of lower costing interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts and savings accounts increased $2.4 billion, while the average balance of higher costing time deposits declined $631.7 million in 2022 compared to 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The average balance of federal funds purchased decreased $204.2 million and repurchase agreements decreased $357,000. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The average balance of other borrowings increased by $42.3 million due to $78.4 million of subordinated debentures assumed from Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022, partially offset by the redemption of $13.0 million of subordinated debentures in late June 2022 . ##TABLE_END 

2021 compared to 2020 

Net interest income and net interest margin highlighted for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Our net interest income increased by $206.7 million, or 25.0%, to $1.0 billion during 2021, compared to 2020, as interest income increased $174.8 million and interest expense declined $31.9 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Our interest income increased by $174.8 million due to - ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9726; Higher non-acquired loan interest income of $115.1 million due to a higher average balance of $3.4 billion, higher investment securities interest income of $32.9 million because of higher average balances of $2.9 billion, acquired loan interest income increasing by $25.7 million because of higher ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START average balances in acquired loans of $1.4 billion, and higher federal funds sold and repurchase agreements interest income of $2.5 million because of higher average balances of $2.6 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9726; These increases in interest income were partially offset by lower interest income of $1.5 million on loans held for sale due to lower average balances of $54.3 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9726; The effects from the increases in the average balance of interest-earning assets have outweighed the effects of the declines in average yields in 2021. ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START o Average interest-earning assets increased $10.2 billion, or 39.9%, to $35.6 billion in 2021, compared to 2020. The increase in the average balance on the non-acquired loan portfolio of $3.4 billion was due to organic growth and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The increase in the average balance on the acquired loan portfolio of $1.4 billion was due to the loans acquired from the merger with CenterState, which were outstanding for 207 days in 2020. Although the acquired loan portfolio increased from 2020, it has declined throughout 2021 due to paydowns, pay-offs and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The increase in the average balance of investment securities of $2.9 billion was a result of the Company&#8217;s decision to strategically increase the investment portfolio due to the excess liquidity from deposit growth. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Overall, our yield on interest-earning assets in 2021 declined 52 basis points from 2020, due to the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drops in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve in March 2020. The yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio decreased 12 basis points, the acquired loan portfolio yield declined 41 basis points, the yield on investment securities dropped by 36 basis points, and on the yield on federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest-bearing deposits decreased by 3 basis points. The yield on loans held for sale remained flat. The yield on interest-earning assets also declined as the average balance of lower yielding federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, interest-bearing deposits and investment securities increased as a percentage of total interest-earning assets from 22.8% to 31.6%. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Our interest expense declined by of $31.9 million in 2021 compared to 2020 due to &#8211; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9726; Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits declining $22.3 million because of a reduction in the average cost of 21 basis points, interest expense related to other borrowings declined $8.9 million because of a lower average balance of $662.6 million, and the interest expense on repurchase agreements declined $790,000 because of a decrease in the average cost of 27 basis points. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9726; The effects from the declines in average cost of interest-bearing liabilities have outweighed the effects of the increases in average balance in 2021. ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START o Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $6.2 billion, or 36.1%, to $23.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 mainly due the interest-bearing liabilities assumed from CenterState, which were outstanding for 207 days in 2020. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $6.5 billion, the average balance of federal funds purchased increased $259.7 million and repurchase agreements increased $65.1 million. The average balance on other borrowing decreased $662.6 million. Within other borrowings, the average balance on corporate and subordinated debentures increased $81.4 million as the Company assumed $271.5 million in borrowings in the merger with CenterState. The increase related to the merger was partially offset by the Company&#8217;s redemption of $63.5 million of subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities assumed from the CenterState merger in June 2021. The average balance of FHLB and FRB borrowings decreased $744.0 million due to the Company&#8217;s strategic decision to payoff $700.0 million of FHLB advances (along with the termination of interest rate hedges on these borrowings) in the fourth quarter of 2020. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2021 compared to 2020 decreased 27 basis points. This decrease occurred in all categories of funding, except for other borrowings which increased 229 basis points in 2021. The primary cause for the lower cost on interest-bearing deposits of 21 basis points, federal funds purchased of 8 basis points and repurchase agreements of 27 basis points was the continued low interest rate environment. The cause for the increase in cost on other borrowings in 2021 is due to having a full year&#8217;s impact from the higher cost of subordinated debt assumed in the CenterState merger along with the effects of paying off the lower cost FHLB and FRB borrowings (along with the termination of the interest rate hedges on these borrowing) in the fourth quarter of 2020. ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#9679; The non-tax equivalent net interest margin decreased by 35 basis points (34 basis point decline on a tax equivalent basis) in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the decline in the yield on interest earning assets of 52 basis points, which was only partially offset by a decrease in cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 27 basis points . ##TABLE_END

Noninterest Income and Expense 

Noninterest income provides us with additional revenues that are significant sources of income. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, noninterest income comprised 18.8%, 25.5%, and 27.4%, respectively, of total net interest income and noninterest income. Beginning in 2020 with the adoption of CECL, recoveries on acquired loans are no longer recorded through the income statement but are recorded through the allowance for credit losses on the balance sheet.

##TABLE_END &#8203; 

2022 compared to 2021 

Our noninterest income decreased 12.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. This change in total noninterest income resulted from the following: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Mortgage banking income decreased by $46.8 million, or 72.5%, which was comprised of $45.5 million, or 75.5%, decrease from mortgage income in the secondary market and a $1.3 million, or 30.1%, decrease from mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge. Starting in the second quarter of 2021, the Company allocated a lower percentage of its mortgage production and pipeline to the secondary market, which resulted in a decrease in mortgage income from the secondary market. The allocation of mortgage production between ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START portfolio and secondary market depends on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate year to year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o During 2022, mortgage income from the secondary market comprised of a $4.8 million increase in the change in fair value of the pipeline, loans held for sale and MBS forward trades and a $50.4 million decrease in the net gain on sale of mortgage loans due to overall lower mortgage production in 2022, along with the lower allocation of mortgage production going to the secondary market. Mortgage commission expense was $12.8 million during 2022 compared to $27.2 million during 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The decrease in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge during 2022 was due to a $3.4 million decrease in the change in fair value of the MSR including decay, which was partially offset by a $2.1 million increase from servicing fee income. The decrease in the change in fair value of the MSR was primarily due to an increase in losses on the MSR hedge of $13.3 million, offset by an increase in the change in fair value from interest rates of $5.0 million and a $5.0 million decline in MSR decay as interest rates have increased since 2021. The increase in the servicing fee income is due to the increase in size of the servicing portfolio. ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Correspondent banking and capital markets income for 2022 decreased by $31.3 million, or 28.4%, from 2021. The decline was due to lower commissions and fees earned on fixed income security sales during 2022 as the volume in sales declined from 2021 and due to expense attributable to the variation margin payments for the centrally cleared swaps . During 2022, the Company determined the variation margin payments for its interest rate swaps centrally cleared through London Clearing House (&#8220;LCH&#8221;) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (&#8220;CME&#8221;) met the legal characteristics of daily settlements of the derivatives rather than collateral. The expense or income attributable to the variation margin payments for the centrally cleared swaps is now reported in noninterest income, specifically within Correspondent and Capital Markets Income, as opposed to interest income or interest expense. We recorded expense of $14.0 million related to variation margin payments in 2022 compared to income of $43,000 in 2021. The increase in expense in 2022 was due to the rise in interest rates which caused a decline in value in our centrally cleared interest rate swaps with LCH and CME. Refer to Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, sections titled &#8220;Derivative Financial Instruments&#8221; and &#8220;Reclassifications&#8221; for a detailed discussion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Service charges on deposit accounts were higher in 2022 by $16.2 million, or 24.5%, compared to 2021. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company modified its consumer overdraft program to eliminate Non-Sufficient Funds (&#8220;NSF&#8221;) fees as well as transfer fees to cover overdrafts. We also started offering a deposit product with no overdraft fees. However, mainly due to the increase in numbers of customers and activity through the Atlantic Capital merger completed during the first quarter of 2022, service charge account maintenance fees increased $9.8 million, NSF and Automated Overdraft Privilege (&#8220;AOP&#8221;) charges increased $4.1 million, and commissions from sales of checks increased $1.7 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was higher by $6.4 million, or 16.1%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was mainly driven by higher debit card income, credit card sales incentive, and merchant card income resulting from the increase in activity related to the acquisition of Atlantic Capital completed in the first quarter of 2022. Debit card income (net of debit card expenses), credit card sales incentive, and merchant card related income increased by $4.1 million, $1.7 million, and by $533,000, respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Bank owned life insurance income increased $5.9 million, or 32.1%, in 2022 compared to 2021. This increase was due to the purchase of $86.0 million of new policies since March 2022 and the addition of $74.6 million in bank owned life insurance through the acquisition of Atlantic Capital completed in the first quarter of 2022, along with an increase in income from the payout of bank owned life insurance policies of $1.1 million in 2022 compared to 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; SBA income, including the impact from the change to fair value accounting during 2022, increased by $3.8 million, or 31.8% compared to 2021. SBA income includes changes in fair value of the servicing asset, loan servicing fees and gains on sale of SBA loans. The increase is mainly attributable to additional business resulting from the acquisition of Atlantic Capital. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Trust and investment services income increased $2.0 million, or 5.5%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in fees earnings as the assets under management increased $53.9 million, or 0.8%, and increases in numbers of accounts and relationships under management from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. ##TABLE_END 

2021 compared to 2020 

Our noninterest income increased 13.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. This change in total noninterest income resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Service charges on deposit accounts were higher in 2021 by $10.3 million, or 18.5%, compared to 2020, due primarily to the increase in customers and activity in 2021 through the merger with CenterState completed during the second quarter of 2020. Year-to-date 2020 only included CenterState activity from June 8, 2020 through December 31, 2020. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts was mainly driven by an increase in service charge maintenance fees on checking and savings accounts, in net NSF and overdraft protection fee income, in fees related to wire transfers and in commissions from sales of checks. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was higher by $11.0 million, or 38.5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was mainly driven by higher debit card, credit card sales incentive, and ATM and merchant card income due to the increase in activity related to the merger with CenterState completed in the second quarter of 2020. Year-to-date 2020 only included CenterState activity from June 8, 2020 through December 31, 2020. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Mortgage banking income decreased by $41.6 million, or 39.2%, which was comprised of $42.2 million, or 41.2%, decrease from mortgage income in the secondary market, partially offset by a $578,000, or 15.5%, increase from mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge. During 2021, mortgage income from the secondary market comprised of a $8.9 million decline in the change in fair value of the pipeline, loans held for sale and MBS forward trades and a $33.3 million decrease in the net gain on sale of mortgage loans. Net gains on the sale of mortgage loans was $75.1 million in 2021, which is net of the commission expense related to mortgage production of $27.2 million. During the second quarter of 2021, the Company began allocating a lower percentage of its mortgage production and pipeline to the secondary market compared to 2020, which resulted in lower mortgage income from the secondary market. This change was mainly due to the increase in liquidity held at the Bank along with the reduction in the gain on sale margin in 2021 compared to 2020. The allocation of mortgage production between portfolio and secondary market depends on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate quarter to quarter. The increase in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge during 2021 was due to a $4.4 million increase from servicing fee income, which was partially offset by a $3.8 million decrease in the change in fair value of the MSR including decay. The decrease in fair value of the MSR is due to an increase in MSR decay of $6.1 million and losses on the MSR hedge of $15.1 million, partially offset by an increase in the change in fair value from interest rates of $17.4 million compared to the 2020. The increase in the servicing fee income is due to the increase in size of the servicing portfolio during 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Trust and investment services income increased $7.5 million, or 25.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in business through the merger with CenterState, which was completed in the second quarter of 2020, resulted in the increase in income. Also, assets under management have increased $902.0 million or 17.4% from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Correspondent banking and capital markets income for 2021 increased by $45.3 million from 2020. Year-to-date 2020 only included CenterState correspondent banking activity from June 8, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Also, the acquisition of SouthState|Duncan-Williams on February 1, 2021 contributed to the increase in correspondent banking and capital markets income during 2021. The income from this business includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Bank owned life insurance income increased $7.0 million, or 61.8%, in 2021 compared to 2020. This increase was due to an increase in the cash surrender value of $8.0 million which resulted from the $333.1 million of bank owned life insurance acquired in the merger with CenterState during the second quarter of 2020, along with the purchase of $205.6 million of policies in April 2021. This increase was partially offset by a $1.0 million decline in income resulting from the payout of insurance policies. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; SBA income increased by $6.1 million, or 107.4% compared to 2020. This increase was due to increases in SBA loan servicing fees and gains on sale of SBA loans which was mainly attributable to having a full year of activity from the CenterState merger in 2021 compared to a partial year in 2020. ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#9679; Other income decreased by $2.7 million or 28.9% in 2021 compared to 2020. This decrease was mainly due to recording a one-time adjustment of $3.6 million in income in 2020 related to the credit valuation adjustment on the Company&#8217;s back-to-back interest rate swaps. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in Small Business Investment Company (&#8220;SBIC&#8221;) investment income of $2.1 million during 2021 as the Company increased its SBIC investment portfolio during 2020 and 2021. ##TABLE_END Noninterest expense represents the largest expense category for our company. During 2022 and 2021, we continued to emphasize careful controls around our noninterest expense. With that, our expenses in 2022 decreased $18.7 million or 2.0% from 2021. Noninterest expense increased $150.8 million or 18.9% in 2021 from 2020 , which was mainly attributable to having a full year of activity from the CenterState merger in 2021 compared to a partial year in 2020.

2022 compared to 2021 

&#8203; 

Noninterest expense decreased $18.7 million, or 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. The change in total noninterest expense resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Merger and branch consolidation related expense decreased $36.4 million, or 54.1% in 2022 compared to 2021. The expense in 2022 consists mainly of costs associated with branch consolidations and the merger related costs pertaining to the Atlantic Capital acquisition. The expense in 2021 mainly consisted of costs related to the merger with CenterState. Merger and branch consolidation expense of $18.5 million in 2022 and $1.7 million in 2021 was related primarily to the merger with Atlantic Capital while $64.4 million in merger and branch consolidation expense was related to the merger with CenterState in 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; The Company had extinguishment of debt cost of $11.7 million in 2021. This cost was from the write-off of the unamortized fair market value adjustment recorded on the trust preferred securities assumed in the CenterState merger. All of the trust preferred securities assumed in the CenterState merger were redeemed in June 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Occupancy expense decreased $2.7 million, or 3.0%. The decrease was related to the cost savings associated with Atlantic Capital and branch consolidations that occurred during 2022. The number of branches declined in 2022 to 251 from 281 at the end of 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Other noninterest expense increased by $12.7 million, or 24.0%. This increase was mainly due to a general increase in expenses due to the merger with Atlantic Capital, an increase in fraud, digital banking and miscellaneous operational charge-off related expenses of $6.5 million, expense related to the settlement of lawsuits of $2.6 million, increases in donations of $1.5 million, increases in tax penalties of $1.3 million, and increases in incurred but not reported insurance loss reserves of $1.1 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Information services expense increased $5.3 million, or 7.1%. The increase was due to additional cost associated with systems added through our acquisition of Atlantic Capital, along with the cost of the Company ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START updating systems as it grows in size and complexity. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges increased $5.1 million, or 28.1%. This increase was due to an increase in FDIC assessments and other regulatory charges. The FDIC assessment increased $4.3 million and OCC examination fee increased $761,000 as the Company continues to grow in size and complexity. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Professional fees increased $4.7 million, or 44.2%, in 2022 compared to 2021. This increase was primarily due to increases in non-loan legal, advisory and consulting related fees. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Business development and staff related expense increased $4.4 million, or 30.5%, due mainly to the increase in employees resulting from the merger with Atlantic Capital and additional employee travel and entertainment as the COVID-19 pandemic receded. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Salary and employee benefits increased by $2.7 million, or 0.5%, primarily due to the addition of Atlantic Capital employees during the year, annual salary increases, and higher 2022 incentive costs. This increase was partially offset by a $7.3 million decline in commission expense and higher deferred loan costs due to increased loan production volumes and the late 2021 update of the Company&#8217;s standard loan costs. During 2022, we recorded a total of $383.6 million in salary expense and $(88.2) million in net deferred loan costs, compared to $366.2 million and $(46.5) million, respectively, during 2021. During 2022, we recorded a total of $35.5 million in commission expense and $96.8 million in incentive expense, compared to $42.8 million and $71.8 million, respectively, during 2021. ##TABLE_END 

&#8203; 

2021 compared to 2020 

&#8203; 

Noninterest expense increased $150.8 million, or 18.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. This increase was mainly due to 2021 having a full year&#8217;s effect from the merger with CenterState while 2020 was only partially affected from the merger date of June 7, 2020. The change in total noninterest expense resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Salary and employee benefits increased by $135.4 million, or 32.5%, as all categories of salaries and benefits expense increased due to the merger with CenterState. Salaries increased $66.9 million, benefits increased $11.4 million, commissions increased $32.5 million, and incentives increased $24.6 million. With the merger with CenterState in June 2020, the Company added approximately 2,800 employees, almost doubling its total employees . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; In the fourth quarter of 2020, the company terminated three cash flow hedges (SWAPs) given the current low interest rate environment and expectation of low interest rates in the foreseeable future resulting in a termination cost of $38.8 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Merger and branch consolidation related expense decreased $18.7 million, or 21.7% in 2021 compared to 2020. Merger and branch consolidation expense of $64.4 million in 2021 and $83.0 million in 2020 was related primarily to the merger with CenterState . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; The Company had extinguishment of debt cost of $11.7 million in 2021. This cost was from the write-off of the fair market value adjustment recorded on the trust preferred securities assumed in the CenterState merger. All of the trust preferred securities assumed in the CenterState merger were redeemed in June 2021 . ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Information services expense and occupancy expense increased $14.6 million, or 24.4% and $16.6 million, or 22.0%, respectively. These increases were related to the additional cost associated with facilities, employees and systems added through our merger with CenterState as our number of branches increased by 129 during 2020 to 285 at December 31, 2020. The number of branches declined slightly in 2021 to 281. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Amortization of intangibles increased $8.2 million, or 30.4%. This increase was due to the merger with CenterState, which resulted in the Company recording a core deposit intangible asset of $125.9 million and a correspondent banking customer intangible asset of $10.0 million in June of 2020. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges increased $7.3 million, or 67.9%. This increase was due to an increase in FDIC assessments and OCC examination fees resulting from the merger with CenterState and the growth since the merger, in addition to new regulatory charges attributable to SouthState|Duncan-Williams. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Business development and staff related expense increased $5.9 million, or 67.1% due mainly to the merger with ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START CenterState with the increase in employees. The increase was also due to limited expense in 2020 attributable to the initial impact from the COVID-19 pandemic before vaccines were available. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Other noninterest expense increased by $8.7 million, or 19.6%. This increase was mainly due to a general increase in expenses due to the merger with CenterState including loan expenses, insurance expense, donations, various operational reserves, and operating charge-offs. There was also an increase of $2.8 million in cost associated with the Association Banking Prime Earnings Credit Program in 2021 from 2020. ##TABLE_END &#8203; 

Income Tax Expense 

Our effective tax rate slightly increased to 21.68% at December 31, 2022 compared to 21.30% for the year-ended December 31, 2021. The increase was mainly due to increase in non-deductible executive compensation, an increase in non-deductible FDIC premiums, and additional expense related to return to provision items recorded during 2022. The increase was partially offset by an increase in tax-exempt income and an increase in the cash surrender value of BOLI policies held, and an increase in federal tax credits available in 2022 compared to 2021. For additional information refer to Note 12&#8212;income Taxes in the consolidated financial statements.

Financial Condition 

&#8203; 

Overview 

&#8203; 

At December 31, 2022, we had total assets of approximately $43.9 billion, consisting principally of $22.8 billion in non-acquired loans, $5.9 billion in acquired non-credit deteriorated loans, $1.4 billion in acquired credit deteriorated loans, net of $356.4 million allowance for credit losses, $8.2 billion in investment securities, $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.9 billion in goodwill. Our liabilities at December 31, 2022 totaled $38.8 billion, consisting principally of deposits of $36.4 billion ($13.2 billion in noninterest-bearing and $23.2 billion in interest-bearing), $1.0 billion derivative liabilities and short-term and long-term borrowings of $948.7 million. At December 31, 2022, our shareholders&#8217; equity was $5.1 billion. 

&#8203; 

At December 31, 2021, we had total assets of approximately $41.8 billion, consisting principally of $16.1 billion in non-acquired loans, $5.9 billion in acquired non-credit impaired loans, $2.0 billion in acquired credit impaired loans, net of $301.8 million allowance for credit losses, $7.2 billion in investment securities, $6.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.6 billion in goodwill. Our liabilities at December 31, 2021 totaled $37.0 billion, consisting principally of deposits of $35.1 billion ($11.5 billion in noninterest-bearing and $23.6 in interest-bearing) and short-term and long-term borrowings of $1.1 billion. At December 31, 2021, our shareholders&#8217; equity was $4.8 billion. 

Book value per common share was $67.04 at the end of 2022, a decrease from $69.27 at the end of 2021. Book value per common share decreased in 2022 as common shares outstanding increased by 9.2% while shareholder equity increased by 5.7%. The primary reason for the increase in common shares outstanding of 6.4 million was due to 7.3 million shares issued for the Atlantic Capital merger, offset by the Company repurchasing 1.3 million shares on the open market in 2022. The primary reasons for an increase in shareholder&#8217;s equity of $272.0 million during 2022 were due to net income of $496.0 million and $659.8 million in common stock issued for the Atlantic Capital acquisition. These increases were partially offset by declines in equity resulting from a $655.9 million reduction in AOCI related to unrealized losses on available for sale securities and post-retirement benefit plans, $146.5 million in dividends paid to shareholders, and $110.2 million in common stock repurchased in the open market. 

Our common equity to assets ratio slightly increased to 11.6% in 2022, compared with 11.5% in 2021. The increase in 2022, compared to 2021, was the result of the percentage increase in shareholders&#8217; equity of 5.7% being greater than the percentage increase in total assets of 5.0%. 

Trading Securities 

We have a trading portfolio associated with our Correspondent Bank Division and the Bank&#8217;s subsidiary SouthState|Duncan-Williams. This portfolio is carried at fair value and realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in trading securities revenue, a component of Correspondent Banking and Capital Market Income in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Securities purchased for this portfolio have primarily been municipal bonds, treasuries and mortgage-backed agency securities, which are held for short periods of time and totaled $31.3 million and $77.7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Investment Securities 

We use investment securities, our second largest category of earning assets, to generate interest income through the deployment of excess funds, provide liquidity, fund loan demand or deposit liquidation, and pledge as collateral for public funds deposits, repurchase agreements and derivative exposure. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, investment securities totaled $8.2 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively . For the year ended December 31, 2022, average investment securities were $8.4 billion, or 21.2% of average earning assets, compared with $5.8 billion, or 16.2% of average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2021. The expected average life of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2022 was approximately 7.96 years, compared with 6.27 years at December 31, 2021. See Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the audited consolidated financial statements for our accounting policy on investment securities.

As securities are purchased, they are designated as held to maturity or available for sale based upon our intent, which considers liquidity needs, interest rate expectations, asset/liability management strategies, and capital requirements.

##TABLE_END During 2022, our total investment securities increased $1.0 billion, or 14.2%, from December 31, 2021. The Atlantic Capital acquisition added $691.7 million of investment securities available for sale to our portfolio. We immediately sold $414.4 million in securities, after principal paydowns, and retained $273.7 million in our portfolio. The Atlantic Capital securities retained were mostly state and municipal obligations. During 2022, we purchased $2.5 billion of securities, $1.1 billion classified as held to maturity, $1.4 billion classified as available for sale and $20.4 million classified as other investments. These purchases were partially offset by maturities, paydowns, sales and calls of investment securities totaling $1.3 billion. Net amortization of premiums were $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

At December 31, 2022, the unrealized net loss of the available for sale investment securities portfolio was $889.3 million, or 14.3%, below its amortized cost basis. Comparable valuations at December 31, 2021 reflected an unrealized net loss of the available for sale investment portfolio of $27.8 million, or 0.5%, below its amortized cost basis. The decrease in fair value in the available for sale investment portfolio at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 was mainly due to an increase in both short term and long term interest rates during 2022. At December 31, 2022, the unrealized net loss of the held to maturity investment securities portfolio was $433.1 million, or 16.1%, below its amortized cost basis. At December 31, 2021, the unrealized net loss of the held to maturity investment securities portfolio was $41.8 million, or 2.3%, below its amortized cost basis.

##TABLE_START * 

Agency mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;), agency collateralized mortgage-obligations (CMO) and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;) are guaranteed by the issuing government-sponsored enterprise (&#8220;GSE&#8221;) as to the timely payments of principal and interest. Except for Government National Mortgage Association securities, which have the full faith and credit backing of the United States Government, the GSE alone is responsible for making payments on this guaranty. While the rating agencies have not rated any of the MBS, CMO and CMBS issued, senior debt securities issued by GSEs are rated consistently as &#8220;Triple-A.&#8221; Most market participants consider agency MBS, CMOs and CMBSs as carrying an implied Aaa rating (S&#38;P rating of AA+) because of the guarantees of timely payments and selection criteria of mortgages backing the securities. We do not own any private label mortgage-backed securities. The balances presented under the ratings above reflect the amortized cost of the investment securities. 

##TABLE_END Held to maturity 

As described above, the Company elected to classify some of its securities purchased during 2022 and 2021 as held to maturity. These are securities that the Company does not intend to sell and expects to hold to maturity. The securities consist of $197.3 million of agency securities, $2.4 billion of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S government agencies or sponsored enterprises and $57.1 million of Small Business Administration loan-backed securities. The following are highlights of our held to maturity portfolio: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Total held to maturity portfolio totaled $2.7 billion ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; The balance of securities held to maturity represented 6.1% of total assets at December 31, 2022. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; We purchased $1.1 billion of held to maturity investment securities in 2022, partially offset by maturities, calls and paydowns totaling $230.0 million in 2022. ##TABLE_END 

Available for sale 

Securities available for sale consist of debentures of government sponsored entities, state and municipal bonds, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S government agencies or sponsored enterprises, Small Business Administration loan-backed securities and corporate securities. At December 31, 2022, investment securities with a fair value and amortized cost of $5.3 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively, were classified as available for sale. The adjustment for net unrealized losses of $889.3 million between the carrying value of these securities and their amortized cost has been reflected, net of tax, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. The following are highlights of our available for sale securities: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Total securities available for sale increased $133.3 million, or 2.6%, from the balance at December 31, 2021 . The unrealized gain/loss position on the investment portfolio decreased $861.5 million and net amortization of premiums was $21.0 million during 2022. We purchased $1.4 billion of available for sale investment securities in 2022, partially offset by maturities, calls and paydowns totaling $575.9 million and sales totaling $482.0 ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START million in 2022. The sales in 2022 were mainly related to restructuring our portfolio to fit our investment strategy and risk profile. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; The balance of securities available for sale represented 12.1% of total assets at December 31, 2022 and 12.4% of total assets at December 31, 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Interest income earned on all investment securities in 2022 was $172.2 million, an increase of $84.6 million, or 96.6%, from $87.6 million in 2021. The increase was due to a $2.7 billion increase in average balances and an increase in the yield on investment securities. The yield on investment securities increased 52 basis points during 2022, to 2.0%. In 2022, we deployed a portion of our on balance sheet liquidity into our investment portfolio as market interest rates increased. Therefore, the 2022 purchases had higher yields compared to the existing portfolio resulting in an increase in the overall yield of our investment portfolio. ##TABLE_END 

At December 31, 2022, we had 1,311 investment securities (including both available for sale and held to maturity) in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $1.3 billion. See Note 3&#8212;Investment Securities in the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The increase in the number of securities in a loss position and the relative percentage of loss to portfolio size was primarily due to an increase in short-term and long-term interest rates during 2022 . 

Management evaluates securities for impairment where there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of a security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. Credit losses are calculated individually, rather than collectively, using a discounted cash flow method, whereby management compares the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the security. The credit loss component would be recognized through the provision for credit losses. Consideration is given to (1) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer including looking at default and delinquency rates, (2) the outlook for receiving the contractual cash flows of the investments, (3) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (4) our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value or for a debt security whether it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the debt security prior to recovering its fair value, (5) the anticipated outlook for changes in the general level of interest rates, (6) credit ratings, (7) third-party guarantees, and (8) collateral values. In analyzing an issuer&#8217;s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, the results of reviews of the issuer&#8217;s financial condition, and the issuer&#8217;s anticipated ability to pay the contractual cash flows of the investments. The Company performed an analysis that determined that the following securities have a zero expected credit loss: U.S. Treasury Securities, Agency-Backed Securities including securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, FHLB, FFCB and SBA. All of the U.S. Treasury and Agency-Backed Securities have the full faith and credit backing of the United States Government or one of its agencies. Municipal securities and all other securities that do not have a zero expected credit loss are evaluated quarterly to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with a decline in fair value. All debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2022 continue to perform as scheduled and we do not believe there is a credit loss or a provision for credit losses is necessary. 

Also, as part of our evaluation of our intent and ability to hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market, we consider our investment strategy, cash flow needs, liquidity position, capital adequacy and interest rate risk position. We do not currently intend to sell the securities within the portfolio and it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the debt securities. Changes in the above considerations may affect our intent in the future. See Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Account Policies for further discussion.

Other Investments 

Our other investment securities consist of non-marketable equity securities that have no readily determinable market value. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. As of December 31, 2022, we determined that there was no impairment on our other investment securities. As of December 31, 2022, other investment securities represented approximately $179.7 million, or 0.41% of total assets and primarily consisted of FRB and FHLB stock which totals $150.3 million and $15.1 million, respectively. There were no gains or losses on the sales of these securities during 2022 or 2021.

Loan Portfolio 

Our loan portfolio remains our largest category of interest- earning assets. At December 31, 2022, total loans, excluding held for sale loans, were $30.2 billion, which was an overall increase of $6.2 billion, or 26.1%, from the balance at the end of 2021. Non-acquired loan growth was $6.8 billion, or 42.1% for 2022, driven by growth in all categories, with the exception of other loans. The loan growth was made up of a 58.4% increase in consumer real estate loans, a 43.9% increase in non- owner occupied real estate loans (including construction and land development loans), a 19.0% increase in commercial owner occupied real estate loans, a 41.7% increase in commercial and industrial loans, a 39.1% increase in other income producing property and a 55.4% increase in consumer non real estate loans. Total acquired loans decreased by $504.6 million, or 6.4%, from the balance at the end of 2021. The decrease in acquired loans was due to paydowns and payoffs in both the PCD and Non-PCD loan categories, along with renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio, offset by the addition of $2.4 billion from the merger with Atlantic Capital during the period.

Average total loans outstanding during 2022 were $27.5 billion, $3.3 billion, or 13.8%, over the 2021 average of $24.1 billion. (For further discussion of the Company&#8217;s acquired loan accounting, see Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 2&#8212;Mergers and Acquisitions, Note 4&#8212;Loans and Note 5&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses in the consolidated financial statements.)

The following highlights of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021:

##TABLE_START &#9679; Non-acquired loans were $22.8 billion, or 75.6% of total loans of total loans at December 31, 2022. This compares to non-acquired loans of $16.1 billion, or 67.1% at December 31, 2021. The increase in non-acquired loans of $6.8 billion was due to organic growth and renewals of acquired loans that were moved to the non-acquired loan portfolio. Excluding the reduction in PPP loans, non-acquired loans increased $7.0 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Acquired loans were $7.4 billion, or 24.4% of total loans at December 31, 2022. This compares to acquired loans of $7.9 billion, or 32.9% at December 31, 2021. The $504.6 million decrease in acquired loans was due to principal payments, charge offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The decline also included a reduction of acquired PPP loans of $11.2 million through pay-off and forgiveness of the loans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Non-acquired loans secured by non-owner occupied and consumer real estate were $13.4 billion and comprised 44.5% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022. This was an increase of $4.4 billion, or 49.3%, over December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, acquired loans secured by non-owner occupied and consumer real estate were $4.0 billion and comprised 13.2% of the total loan portfolio. This was a decrease of $598.4 million, or 13.1%, over December 31, 2021. Between both the non-acquired and acquired portfolios, 57.7% of loans were non-owner occupied and consumer real estate loans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Of the non-acquired real estate loans at December 31, 2022, $8.1 billion, or 26.8% of the loan portfolio were secured by non-owner occupied real estate. Loans secured by consumer real estate were $5.3 billion, ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START or 17.7% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022. This compared to loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate of $5.6 billion, or 23.5% and loans secured by consumer real estate of $3.4 billion, or 14.1% at December 31, 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Of these acquired real estate loans, $2.8 billion, or 9.4% of the loan portfolio were secured by non-owner occupied real estate at December 31, 2022. Loans secured by consumer real estate were $1.1 billion, or 3.8%. This compared to acquired loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate of $3.1 billion, or 13.2% and loans secured by consumer real estate of $1.4 billion, or 6.0% at December 31, 2021. ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Included within loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate noted above are construction and land development loans. Total construction and land development loans were $2.9 billion at December 31, 2022 compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2021. Construction and land development loans are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Non-acquired construction and land development loans increased $766.3 million in 2022 from $1.8 million at December 31, 2021 to $2.6 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Acquired construction and land development loans increased $64.8 million in 2022 from $240.1 million at December 31, 2021 to $304.9 million. ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Total consumer real estate loans were comprised of $5.2 billion in consumer owner occupied loans and $1.3 billion in home equity line loans at December 31, 2022. This compares to $3.6 billion in consumer owner occupied loans and $1.2 billion in home equity lines loans at December 31, 2021. During 2022, the consumer real estate loan portfolio increased by $1.7 billion from December 31, 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Non-acquired loans secured by consumer real estate were comprised of $4.4 billion in consumer owner occupied loans and $958.2 million in home equity loans at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2021, we had $2.7 billion in consumer owner occupied loans and $710.3 million in home equity loans in the non-acquired loan portfolio. The Company made the decision to hold more of 1-4 family mortgage production in its portfolio in 2022 rather than sell the loans into the secondary market. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Acquired loans secured by consumer real estate comprised of $781.0 million in consumer owner occupied loans and $355.0 million in home equity loans at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2021, we had $977.3 million in consumer owner occupied loans and $458.3 million in home equity loans in the acquired loan portfolio. ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Non-acquired and acquired commercial owner-occupied real estate loans were $3.7 billion, or 12.2% and $1.8 billion or 5.9%, respectively, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 compared to $3.1 billion, or 13.0% and $1.9 billion or 7.8%, respectively, at December 31, 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Non-acquired commercial owner-occupied real estate loans increased $589.5 million through organic growth and renewals of acquired loans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Acquired commercial owner-occupied real estate loans decreased $99.4 million due to principal payments, charge offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio from December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2022. ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Non-acquired and acquired commercial and industrial loans were $4.1 billion, or 13.6% and $1.2 billion or 4.0%, respectively, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 compared to $2.9 billion, or 12.1% and $855.5 million or 3.6%, respectively, at December 31, 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Non-acquired commercial and industrial loans increased $1.2 billion. The overall increase in non-acquired commercial and industrial loans included a $223.3 million decline in PPP loans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Acquired commercial and industrial loans increased $339.7 million from December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2022. The overall increase in acquired commercial and industrial loans included a $11.2 million decline in PPP loans. ##TABLE_END 

Total loan interest income, excluding interest income on held for sale loans, was $1.2 billion in 2022, an increase of $191.6 million, or 19.5%, over $983.7 million in 2021. This increase was mainly due to a $5.0 billion increase in the average balance of our non-acquired loan portfolio, offset by a $1.6 billion decrease in the average balance of our acquired loan portfolio. The growth in the non-acquired loan portfolio average balance was due to normal organic growth and renewals of acquired loans . The decline in the acquired loan portfolio was due to paydowns 

and payoffs in both the PCD and Non-PCD loan categories, along with renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio, even with the $2.4 billion in loans acquired through the merger with Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022. The effects on interest income from the overall increases in average portfolio balances were enhanced by a 24 basis point increase in the yield on the non-acquired portfolio and a 36 basis point increase in the yield on the acquired portfolio. The yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio increased from 3.79% in 2021 to 4.03% in 2022 and the yield on the acquired loan portfolio increased from 4.49% in 2021 to 4.85% in 2022. The increase in the yields on the non-acquired loan portfolio and the acquired loan portfolio was due to the rise in interest rates starting in March 2022. 

The table below shows the contractual maturity of the non-acquired loan portfolio at December 31, 2022.

##TABLE_END Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) 

We designate expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan. When determining the contractual term, the Company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions, renewals, or modifications, unless the Company reasonably expects it will execute a TDR with a borrower. In the event of a reasonably-expected TDR, the Company factors the reasonably-expected TDR into the current expected credit losses estimate. For consumer loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the borrower&#8217;s application for a modification (i.e., the borrower qualifies for the TDR) or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. For commercial loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the loan for modification or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. The Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology for a TDR to calculate the effect of the concession provided to the borrower within the ACL. 

A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, the Company implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. The Company&#8217;s payment relief assistance includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to not apply TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if the concession met the criteria as defined under the CARES Act. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, total TDRs were $21.4 million and $12.5 million, respectively, of which $13.5 million were accruing restructured loans at December 31, 2022, compared to $11.2 million at December 31, 2021. We do not have significant commitments to lend additional funds to these borrowers whose loans have been modified.

Total non-acquired nonperforming loans were $47.0 million, or 0.21% of total non-acquired loans, an increase of approximately $23.7 million, or 101.7%, from December 31, 2021. The increase in nonperforming loans was driven primarily by an increase in commercial nonaccrual loans of $19.4 million, an increase in restructured nonaccrual loans of $3.7 million, an increase in consumer nonaccrual loans of $2.9 million, offset by a decrease in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $2.3 million. The increase in commercial nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2022 was primarily due to three commercial owner occupied loans totaling $16.0 million and two commercial and industrial loans totaling $2.5 million. Acquired nonperforming loans were $61.5 million, or 0.83% of total acquired loans, an increase of $4.6 million, or 8.0%, from December 31, 2021. The increase in acquired nonperforming loans was mainly driven by an increase in commercial nonaccrual loans of $5.8 million, an in crease in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $1.7 million, offset by a decrease in consumer nonaccrual loans of $3.0 million. 

The top ten nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2022 totaled $38.1 million and consisted of one loan located in South Carolina, one in North Carolina, six in Georgia, and two in Florida. These loans comprise 31.6% of total nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2022, with the majority being real estate collateral dependent. We currently hold a specific reserve against two of these ten loans, totaling $2.4 million. The remaining eight loans do not carry a specific reserve due to carrying balances being below current collateral values or the loans are SBA guaranteed. 

At December 31, 2022, non-acquired OREO decreased by $111,000 from the balance at December 31, 2021 to $141,000. At December 31, 2022, non-acquired OREO consisted of three properties with an average value of $47,000, a decrease of $205,000 in the average value from December 31, 2021 when we had one property. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we transferred one property with a value of $83,000 to non-acquired OREO, and we sold no properties during the quarter. At December 31, 2022, one of the non-acquired OREO properties was located in the Hillsborough (Fort Myers, Fla) region and two of the properties were located in the Beaufort (SC) region. 

At December 31, 2022, acquired OREO decreased by $1.6 million from the balance at December 31, 2021 to $0.9 million. At December 31, 2022, acquired OREO consisted of three properties with an average value of $294,000, an increase of $68,000 from December 31, 2021 when we had 11 properties. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we did not transfer new properties into acquired OREO, however, we sold seven properties with a basis of $1.2 million during the quarter, resulting in a net loss of $85,000 on the properties sold. 

Our general policy is to obtain updated OREO valuations at least annually. OREO valuations include appraisals or broker opinions, (See Other Real Estate Owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;) under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7&#8212;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion on our OREO policies.)

Potential Problem Loans 

Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming loans, related to non-acquired loans were approximately $15.8 million, or 0.07% of total non-acquired loans outstanding at December 31, 2022, compared to $6.9 million, or 0.04% of total non-acquired loans outstanding at December 31, 2021. Potential problem loans related to acquired loans totaled $23.1 million, or 0.31%, of total acquired loans at December 31, 2022 compared to $19.3 million, or 0.24% of total acquired loans outstanding, at December 31, 2021. All potential problem loans represent loans where information about possible credit problems of the borrowers may result in the borrower&#8217;s inability to comply with present repayment terms. 

Allowance for Credit Losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) 

As stated previously, the ACL reflects management&#8217;s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. The Company established the incremental increase in the ACL at adoption through equity and subsequent adjustments through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings. The Company records loans charged off against the ACL and subsequent recoveries, if any, increase the ACL when they are recognized. 

Management uses systematic methodologies to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, management&#8217;s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. The Company&#8217;s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects management&#8217;s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses. The Company&#8217;s ACL is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans. 

The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans with similar risk characteristics are grouped into homogenous segments, or pools, for analysis. The Discounted Cash Flow (&#8220;DCF&#8221;) method is used for each loan in a pool, and the results are aggregated at the pool level. A periodic tendency to default and absolute loss given default are applied to a projective model of the loan&#8217;s cash flow while considering prepayment and principal curtailment effects. The analysis produces expected cash flows for each instrument in the pool by pairing loan-level term information (e.g., maturity date, payment amount, interest rate, etc.) with top-down pool assumptions (e.g., default rates and prepayment speeds). The Company has identified the following portfolio segments: Owner-Occupied Commercial Real Estate, Non Owner-Occupied Commercial Real Estate, Multifamily, Municipal, Commercial and Industrial, Commercial Construction and Land Development, Residential Construction, Residential Senior Mortgage, Residential Junior Mortgage, Revolving Mortgage, and Consumer and Other. 

In determining the proper level of the ACL, management has determined that the loss experience of the Bank provides the best basis for its assessment of expected credit losses. The Company therefore used its own historical credit loss experience by each loan segment over an economic cycle, while excluding loss experience from certain acquired institutions (i.e., failed banks). For most of the segment models for collectively evaluated loans, the Company incorporated two or more macroeconomic drivers using a statistical regression modeling methodology. 

Management considers forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses. The Company subscribes to a third-party service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the United States economy. The baseline, along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios, is used by management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and takes into consideration the scenarios in relation to actual economic and other data, such as gross domestic product growth, monetary and fiscal policy, inflation, supply chain issues and global events like the Russian/Ukraine conflict, as well as the volatility and magnitude of changes within those scenarios quarter over quarter, and consideration of conditions within the bank&#8217;s operating environment and geographic area. Additional forecast scenarios may be weighted along with the baseline forecast to arrive at the final reserve estimate. While periods of relative economic stability should generally lead to stability in forecast scenarios and weightings to estimate credit losses, periods of instability can likewise require management to adjust the selection of scenarios and weightings, in accordance with the accounting standards. For the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straight-line approach. The Company generally uses a four-quarter forecast and a four-quarter reversion period. 

It is widely acknowledged that the chances of recession are still high. Accordingly, management continues to use a blended forecast scenario of the baseline and more severe scenario, depending on the circumstances and economic outlook. As of December 31, 2022, management selected a baseline weighting of 75% and decreased the more severe scenario to 25% from using a baseline weighting of 60% and the more severe scenario of 40% at the end of the third quarter of 2022. The increase of the baseline weighting reflects increasing recognition of more downside risks in the economic forecast from persistent levels of inflation and rising interest rates, geopolitical tension and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and global supply chain, energy and commodity issues. The more severe scenario increased in severity from the prior quarter and was viewed as less likely by management. While employment figures still showed resilience and provision related to actual loan losses remains at very low levels, the downward shifts in forecasted commercial real estate price index, national house price index and GDP increased expected loss rates for Commercial and Residential Real Estate as well as C&#38;I loans. The resulting provision was approximately $47.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2022, including a provision for unfunded commitments of $14.2 million during the quarter. During 2022, the Company recorded $81.6 million in provision for credit losses, including a provision of $36.7 million for unfunded commitments. 

Included in its systematic methodology to determine its ACL, management considers the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. These qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation (i.e., formulaic model results). Each period the Company considers qualitative factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework that includes the following: (1) lending policy; (2) economic conditions not captured in models; (3) volume and mix of loan portfolio; (4) past due trends; (5) concentration risk; (6) external factors; and (7) model limitations. At December 31, 2022, we included $9.2 million in qualitative adjustments, which was comprised of model limitations pertaining to the PCD loan portfolio acquired through the Atlantic Capital merger of $1.6 million, potential impact of rising rates on certain C&#38;I credits of $3.3 million, and implementation of a new reserve framework for loan policy exceptions of $4.3 million. Of the total $9.2 million in qualitative adjustments made in the fourth quarter of 2022, $1.3 million was related to unfunded commitments. 

When a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with its segment, the asset is assessed to determine whether it should be included in another pool or should be individually evaluated. The Company&#8217;s threshold for individually evaluated loans includes all non-accrual loans with a net book balance in excess of $1.0 million. management will monitor the credit environment and make adjustments to this threshold in the future if warranted. Based on the threshold above, consumer financial assets will generally remain in pools unless they meet the dollar threshold. The expected credit losses on individually evaluated loans will be estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis unless the loan meets the criteria for use of the fair value of collateral, either by virtue of an expected foreclosure or through meeting the definition of collateral-dependent. Financial assets that have been individually 

evaluated can be returned to a pool for purposes of estimating the expected credit loss insofar as their credit profile improves and the repayment terms were not considered to be unique to the asset. 

Management measures expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan. When determining the contractual term, the Company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions, renewals, or modifications, unless the Company reasonably expects it will execute a troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;) with a borrower. In the event of a reasonably expected TDR, the Company factors the reasonably-expected TDR into the current expected credit losses estimate. For consumer loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the borrower&#8217;s application for a modification (i.e., the borrower qualifies for the TDR) or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. For commercial loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the loan for modification or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. The Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology for a TDR to calculate the effect of the concession provided to the borrower within the ACL. The Company has not chosen to early adopt the retirement of TDR guidance, which was adopted effective January 1, 2023. 

A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the CARES Act, the Company implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. The Company&#8217;s payment relief assistance includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to not apply TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if the concession met the criteria as defined under the CARES Act. 

For purchased credit-deteriorated, otherwise referred to herein as PCD, assets are defined as acquired individual financial assets (or acquired groups of financial assets with similar risk characteristics) that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Company&#8217;s assessment. The Company records acquired PCD loans by adding the expected credit losses (i.e., allowance for credit losses) to the purchase price of the financial assets rather than recording through the provision for credit losses in the income statement. The expected credit loss, as of the acquisition day, of a PCD loan is added to the allowance for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is the difference between the unpaid principal balance and the amortized cost basis as of the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the change in the ACL on PCD loans is recognized through the provision for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is accreted or amortized, respectively, into interest income over the remaining life of the PCD loan on a level-yield basis. In accordance with the transition requirements within the standard, the Company&#8217;s acquired credit-impaired loans (i.e., ACI or Purchased Credit Impaired) were treated as PCD loans. As a result of the merger with Atlantic Capital, the Company identified approximately $137.9 million of loans as PCD and recorded an allowance for credit losses of $13.8 million on acquisition date for PCD loans. 

Atlantic Capital was acquired and merged with and into the Bank on March 1, 2022, requiring that a closing date ACL be prepared for Atlantic Capital on a standalone basis and that the acquired portfolio be included in the Bank&#8217;s first quarter ACL. Atlantic Capital&#8217;s loans represented approximately 8% of the total Bank&#8217;s portfolio at March 31, 2022. Given the relative size and complexity of the acquired portfolio, similarities of the loan characteristics, and similar loss history to the existing portfolio, reserve calculations were performed using the Bank&#39;s existing CECL model, loan segmentation, and forecast weighting as the first quarter end reserve. The acquisition date ACL totaled $27.5 million, consisting of a non-PCD pooled reserve of $13.7 million, PCD pooled reserve of $5.7 million, and PCD individually evaluated reserve of $8.1 million. It represented about 8% of the combined Bank&#8217;s ACL reserve at March 31, 2022. The acquisition date reserve for unfunded commitments totaled $3.4 million, or 11% of the combined Bank&#8217;s total at March 31, 2022. 

The Company follows its nonaccrual policy by reversing contractual interest income in the income statement when the Company places a loan on nonaccrual status. Therefore, management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on the portfolio and does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the accrued interest receivable for loans recorded in Other Assets were $105.4 million and $70.6 million, respectively. 

The Company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an off-balance sheet exposure. These primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit. The expected losses 

associated with these exposures within the unfunded portion of the expected credit loss will be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. Management has determined that a majority of the Company&#8217;s off-balance-sheet credit exposures are not unconditionally cancellable. Management completes funding studies based on historical data to estimate the percentage of unfunded loan commitments that will ultimately be funded to calculate the reserve for unfunded commitments. Management applies this funding rate, along with the loss factor rate determined for each pooled loan segment, to unfunded loan commitments, excluding unconditionally cancellable exposures and letters of credit, to arrive at the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the liabilities recorded for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments were $67.2 million and $30.5 million, respectively. The current adjustment to the ACL for unfunded commitments is recognized through the Provision (Recovery) for Credit Losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company did not have an allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financials asset during 2022. 

As of December 31, 2022, the balance of the ACL was $356.4 million, or 1.18%, of total loans. The ACL increased $32.0 million from the balance of $324.4 million recorded at September 30, 2022. This increase during the fourth quarter of 2022 was the result of $32.9 million provision for credit losses and $0.9 million in net charge-offs. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the ACL increased $54.6 million from the balance of $301.8 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in ACL of $54.6 million was due a provision for credit losses of $45.2 million, $13.7 million due to the initial allowance for PCD loans acquired in the Atlantic Capital acquisition, along with net charge-offs of $4.3 million in 2022. For both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded provision for credit losses due to loan growth and current forecasts applied to our modeling to adequately capture growing economic recessionary risks . As of December 31, 2021, the balance of the ACL was $301.8 million or 1.26% of total loans. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the ACL decreased $155.5 million from the balance of $457.3 million. The decrease in ACL of $155.5 million was due to a release of the allowance for credit losses of $152.4 million along with net charge-offs of $3.1 million in 2021. For 2021, the Company had releases of allowance for credit losses resulting from improvements in the economic forecasts that drive our ACL model as the economy improved during 2021. 

&#8203; 

At December 31, 2022, the Company had a reserve on unfunded commitments of $67.2 million, which was recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared to $30.5 million at December 31, 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments of $14.2 million. The year-to-date provision of $36.7 million recorded in 2022 includes the initial provision for credit losses for unfunded commitments acquired from Atlantic Capital, which the Company recorded during the first quarter of 2022. The Company recorded a release of $12.9 million related to unfunded commitments during 2021. The provision for credit losses for unfunded commitments is based on the growth in unfunded loan commitments, production mix, and current forecast scenarios applied to our modeling to adequately capture growing economic recessionary risks. This amount was recorded in Provision (Recovery) for Credit Losses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

&#8203; 

The ACL provides 3.28 times coverage of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2022. Net charge offs to total average loans during the year ended December 31, 2022 were 0.02%, compared to 0.01% during the year ended December 31, 2021. We continued to show solid and stable asset quality numbers and ratios as of December 31, 2022. The following table provides the allocation, by segment, for expected credit losses. Because PPP loans are government guaranteed and management implemented additional reviews and procedures to help mitigate potential losses, management does not expect to recognize credit losses on this loan portfolio and as a result, did not record an ACL for PPP loans within the C&#38;I loan segment presented in the table below.

Deposits 

We rely on deposits by our customers as the primary source of funds for the continued growth of our loan and investment securities portfolios. Customer deposits are categorized as either noninterest-bearing deposits or interest- bearing deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits (or demand deposits) are transaction accounts that provide us with &#8220;interest- free&#8221; sources of funds. Interest-bearing deposits include savings deposit, interest-bearing transaction accounts, certificates of deposits, and other time deposits. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include HSA, IOLTA, and Market Rate checking accounts. 

During 2022, overall deposits increased $1.3 billion, or 3.7%, to $36.4 billion from December 31, 2021. The increase was mainly due to the deposits assumed from the merger with Atlantic Capital in March 2022. The acquisition date deposits assumed from Atlantic Capital totaled $3.0 billion and were approximately $2.5 billion at December 31, 2022. Excluding the deposits assumed in the Atlantic Capital acquisition, our deposits have declined $1.2 billion in 2022 as the funds in the market from federal government stimulus programs have declined along with the effects from 

rising interest rates in the second half of 2022, which has increased competition and alternatives for deposits. The changes in our deposits since December 31, 2021 included an increase in noninterest-bearing transaction account deposits of $1.7 billion and saving deposits of $113.8 million. These increases were offset by a decline in interest-bearing demand deposits (including money market accounts) of $97.7 million and time deposits of $390.1 million. During 2022, we continued our focus on increasing core deposits (excluding certificates of deposits and other time deposits), which are normally lower cost funds compared to certificate of deposit balances.

##TABLE_END At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company estimates that is has approximately $14.1 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively, in uninsured deposits including related interest accrued and unpaid. Since it is not reasonably practicable to provide a precise measure of uninsured deposits, the amounts above are estimates and are based on the 

same methodologies and assumptions used for the bank&#8217;s regulatory reporting requirements by the FDIC for the Call Report. 

The following table provides a maturity distribution of uninsured time deposits for the next twelve months as of December 31:

##TABLE_END Short-Term Borrowed Funds 

Our short- term borrowed funds consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, FRB borrowings on a secured line of credit, short-term FHLB Advances and the U.S. Bank line of credit. Note 10 &#8212; Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase in our audited financial statements provides a profile of these funds at each year-end, the average amounts outstanding during each period, the maximum amounts outstanding at any month-end, and the weighted average interest rates on year- end and average balances in each category. Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase most typically have maturities within one to three days from the transaction date. Certain of these borrowings have no defined maturity date. Note 11 &#8212; Other Borrowings in our audited financial statements provide provides a profile of short-term FHLB advances, FRB borrowings and the U.S. Bank line of credit at each year-end, the average amount outstanding during each period and the weighted average interest rates on year- end and average balances. Short-term FHLB advances has a maturity of less than one year and the FRB borrowings and U.S. Bank line of credit has a daily maturity. 

Long-Term Borrowed Funds 

Our long- term borrowed funds consist of trust preferred junior subordinated debt and corporate subordinated debt. Note 11 &#8212; Other Borrowings in our audited financial statements provides a profile of these funds at each year- end, the balance at year end, the interest rate at year end and the weighted average interest rate for long-term borrowings. Each issuance of trust preferred junior subordinated debt has a maturity of 30 years, but we can call the debt at any time without penalty. 

Capital and Dividends 

Our ongoing capital requirements have been met primarily through retained earnings, less the payment of cash dividends. As of December 31, 2022, shareholders&#8217; equity was $5.1 billion, an increase of $272.0 million, or 5.7%, compared to the balance at December 31, 2021. The change from year-end 2021 was mainly attributable to net income of $496.0 million and stock, net of unvested equity awards, issued pursuant to the acquisition of Atlantic Capital of $657.8 million, less dividends paid on common shares of $146.5 million, common stock repurchased under our stock repurchase plan of $110.2 million and a decline in the AOCI attributable to a decrease in the market value of securities available for sale of $655.2 million.

##TABLE_END Our equity-to-assets ratio increased to 11.6% at December 31, 2022 from 11.5% at December 31, 2021. The increase from December 31, 2021 was due to the percentage increase in equity of 5.7% being higher than the percentage increase in total assets of 5.0%. The higher percentage growth in capital was mainly due to the Company&#8217;s net income of $496.0 million and stock , net of unvested equity awards, issued pursuant to the acquisition of Atlantic Capital of $657.8 million. The increase in assets in 2022 was mainly due to the assets acquired in the merger with Atlantic Capital and from the growth in investments and loans resulting from the growth in deposits of $1.3 billion. 

In January 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the 2021 Stock Repurchase Plan, which authorized the Company to repurchase 3,500,000 common shares. During 2021 and through December 31, 2022, we repurchased 3,129,979 shares, at an average price of $81.97 per share, excluding cost of commissions, for a total of $256.6 million. Of this amount, we repurchased 1,312,038 shares, at an average price of $83.99 per share (excluding cost of commissions) for a total of $110.2 million during 2022 under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Plan. 

&#8203; 

On June 7, 2022, the Company received the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s supervisory nonobjection on the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program. The 2022 Stock Repurchase Program authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 3.75 million shares, or up to approximately five percent, of the Company&#8217;s outstanding shares of common stock as of March 31, 2022. Our Board of Directors approved the program after considering, among other things, our liquidity needs and capital resources as well as the estimated current value of our net assets. The aggregate number of shares of common stocks authorized to be repurchased totals 4.12 million shares, which includes 370,021 shares remaining from the Company&#8217;s 2021 Stock Repurchase Plan. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of the purchases are based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of our common stock, and the availability of alternative investment opportunities. 

&#8203; 

We are subject to regulations with respect to certain risk-based capital ratios. These risk-based capital ratios measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks. The values of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are adjusted based on the rules to reflect categorical credit risk. In addition to the risk-based capital ratios, the regulatory agencies have also established a leverage ratio for assessing capital adequacy. The leverage ratio is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by total consolidated on-balance sheet assets (minus amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital). The leverage ratio does not involve assigning risk weights to assets. 

&#8203; 

Specifically, we are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios:

&#8203; 

##TABLE_START &#9679; a CET1, risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; a leverage ratio of 4%. ##TABLE_END 

Under the current capital rules, Tier 1 capital includes two components: CET1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The highest form of capital, CET1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, otherwise referred to as AOCI, and limited amounts of minority 

interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and Tier 1 minority interests. Tier 2 capital generally includes the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying preferred stock, subordinated debt, trust preferred securities and qualifying tier 2 minority interests, less any deductions in Tier 2 instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution. AOCI is presumptively included in CET1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. When the current capital rules were first implemented, the Bank exercised its one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI, allowing us to retain our pre-existing treatment for AOCI. 

In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a banking organization must maintain a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three risk-based measurements (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital), resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. 

The Bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized) and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three risk-based regulatory capital ratios (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital) and for the leverage ratio.

The federal banking agencies revised their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the implementation of CECL&#894; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the adoption date adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL&#894; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing. CECL became effective for us on January 1, 2020 and the Company applied the provisions of the standard using the modified retrospective method as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. Related to the implementation of ASU 2016-13, we recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of $54.4 million, deferred tax assets of $12.6 million, an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of $6.4 million and an adjustment to retained earnings of $44.8 million. Instead of recognizing the effects on regulatory capital from ASU 2016-13 at adoption, the Company initially elected the option for recognizing the adoption date effects on the Company&#8217;s regulatory capital calculations over a three-year phase-in .

&#8203; 

In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations that adopt CECL in the 2020 calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by the aforementioned three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of benefit during the initial two-year delay for a total five-year transition. The estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital (modified CECL transitional amount) is calculated as the sum of the adoption date impact on retained earnings upon adoption of CECL (CECL transitional amount) and the calculated change in the ACL relative to the adoption date ACL upon adoption of CECL multiplied by a scaling factor of 25%. The scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the ACL under CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology. The Company chose the five-year transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from the adoption date and the CECL difference for the first two years of application. The modified CECL transitional amount was calculated each quarter for the first two years of the five-year transition. The amount of the modified CECL transition amount was fixed as of December 31, 2021, and that amount is subject to the three-year phase out, which began in the first quarter of 2022.

##TABLE_END The Company&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios decreased compared to December 31, 2021. These ratios decreased due to the additional risk-

weighted assets acquired through the acquisition of Atlantic Capital in the first quarter of 2022, which on average, had a higher risk weighting, the reduction in cash and cash equivalents during the year, which are lower risk weighted assets, and due to the organic growth in loans during 2022, which have a higher risk weighting. The effects on our ratios from the increase in risk-weighted assets were partially offset by an increase in Tier 1 and total risk-based capital due to net income recognized in 2022, the addition to the net equity of $657.8 million issued for the Atlantic Capital acquisition and the $75.0 million in subordinated debentures assumed from Atlantic Capital that qualifies as total risk-based capital. These increases in capital were partially offset by the $119.3 million of stock repurchases completed during 2022, including shares withheld for taxes pertaining to the vesting of equity awards, along with the dividend paid to shareholders of $146.5 million and the redemption of $13.0 million of subordinated debentures on June 30, 2022. The Tier 1 leverage ratios for both the Company and Bank increased compared to December 31, 2021, as the percentage increase in Tier 1 capital was greater than the percentage increase in average assets during 2022 due mainly to net income and equity issued in the Atlantic Capital acquisition. Our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory classification. 

&#8203; 

The Company pays cash dividends to shareholders from its assets, which are mainly provided by dividends from its banking subsidiary. However, certain restrictions exist regarding the ability of its banking subsidiary to transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. The approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. The federal banking agencies have issued policy statements which provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current earnings. 

&#8203; 

During 2022, the Bank paid dividends to SouthState totaling $220.0 million. The Bank was not required to obtain approval of the OCC to pay these dividends. We used these funds and excess cash to pay our dividend to shareholders of $146.5 million, repurchase sh ares of our common stock on the open market totaling $110.2 million and redeem $13.0 million in subordinated debentures.

##TABLE_END We retain earnings to have capital sufficient to grow our loan and investment portfolios and to support certain acquisitions or other business expansion opportunities. The dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends paid during the year by net income for the year.

Liquidity 

Liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations, which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits, extension of credit and payment of operating expenses. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank&#8217;s financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet its obligations. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring policies designed to ensure acceptable composition of our asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. We have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs. 

Asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans, investment securities and other short-term investments. Management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and investments. Normally, changes in the earning asset mix are of a longer-term nature and are not used for day-to-day corporate liquidity needs. 

&#8203; 

Our liabilities provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, interest-bearing deposits at other banks and other short-term borrowings. We engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our Bank; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Pricing deposits, including certificates of deposit, at rate levels that will attract and /or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our Bank&#8217;s asset/liability management and net interest margin requirements; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our Bank&#8217;s appeal as a primary provider of financial services. ##TABLE_END 

Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by approximately $6.8 billion, or approximately 42.1%, compared to the balance at December 31, 2021. The increase in the non-acquired loan portfolio was due to organic growth and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The acquired loan portfolio decreased by $504.6 million, or 6.4%, from the balance at December 31, 2021. This decrease was due to principal paydowns, charge-offs, foreclosures, and renewals of acquired loans moved to the non-acquired loan portfolio, offset by the addition of $2.4 billion in loans acquired from the Atlantic Capital transaction on March 1, 2022 

Our investment securities portfolio increased $1.0 billion, or approximately 14.2%, compared to the balance at December 31, 2021. The increase in investment securities from December 31, 2021 was due to the Company making the decision to increase the size of the portfolio with the excess funds from deposit growth in the first half of 2022. The increase was a result of purchases of $2.5 billion, along with $703.7 million in investment securities acquired in the Atlantic Capital transaction. These increases were partially offset by maturities, calls, sales and paydowns of investment securities totaling $1.3 billion. N et amortization of premiums was $27.3 million in 2022. Total cash and cash equivalents declined $5.4 billion in 2022 to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to $6.7 billion at December 31, 2021. This decline was due to the Company using funds to fund loan growth and purchase securities in 2022, along with the decline in deposits in the second half of 2022. 

At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had $150.0 million and $325.0 million of traditional, out&#8211;of-market brokered deposits. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had $637.0 million and $900.1 million, respectively, of reciprocal brokered deposits. Total deposits were $36.4 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $1.3 billion from $35.1 billion at December 31, 2021. Our deposit growth since December 31, 2021 included an increase in demand deposit accounts of $1.7 billion and an increase in savings of $113.8 million, partially offset by a decline in certificates of deposit of $390.1 million, a decrease in interest-bearing transaction accounts of $63.5 million and a decrease in money market accounts of $34.3 million. The increase in deposits was mainly due to the deposits assumed from the merger with Atlantic Capital in March 2022. The acquisition date deposits assumed from Atlantic Capital totaled $3.0 billion and were approximately $2.5 billion at December 31, 2022. Excluding the deposits assumed in the Atlantic Capital acquisition, our deposits have declined $1.2 billion in 2022 as the funds in the market from federal government stimulus programs have declined, along with the effects from rising interest rates in the second half of 2022 resulting from increased competition and alternatives for deposits. Total short-term borrowings at December 31, 2022 were $556.4 million consisting of $213.6 million in federal funds purchased and $342.8 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Total long-term borrowings at December 31, 2022 were $392.3 million and consisted of trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures, which includes $78.5 million of subordinated debt assumed from Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022. To the extent that we employ other types of non-deposit funding sources, typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers, we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds. Our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise.

Through the operations of our Bank, we have made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities. These commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to our customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time. We manage the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes. We believe that we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund commitments that are drawn upon by the borrowers. In addition to commitments to extend credit, we also issue standby letters of credit, which are assurances to third parties that they will not suffer a loss if our customer fails to meet its contractual obligation to the third-party. Although our experience indicates that many of these standby letters of credit will expire unused, through our various sources of liquidity, we believe that we will have the necessary 

resources to meet these obligations should the need arise. 

Our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position, as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets, typically including some level of reverse repurchase agreements, federal funds sold, balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, and/or other short-term investments; asset quality; well-capitalized position; and profitable operating results. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our desired liquidity position at any time. We expect that these conditions would generally be of a short-term nature. Under such circumstances, we expect our reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds sold positions, or balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, if any, to serve as the primary source of immediate liquidity. We could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks and/or the FHLB. At December 31, 2022, we had a total FHLB credit facility of $4.2 billion with total outstanding FHLB letters of credit consuming $2.1 million leaving $4.2 billion in availability on the FHLB credit facility . At December 31, 2022, we had total federal funds credit lines of $300.0 million with no outstanding advances. If we needed additional liquidity, we would turn to short-term borrowings as an alternative immediate funding source and would consider other appropriate actions such as promotions to increase core deposits or the use of the brokered deposit markets. In addition, at December 31, 2022, we had $782.0 million of credit available at the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s discount window, but had no outstanding advances as of the end of 2022. We have a $100.0 million unsecured line of credit with U.S. Bank National Association with no outstanding advances at December 31, 2022. We believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available.

Our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on stressed liquidity levels. Liquidity key risk indicators are reported to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. We maintain various wholesale sources of funding. If our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful, we would use these alternative sources of funding. Under such circumstances, depending on the external source of funds, our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates charged. This could increase our cost of funds, impacting our net interest margin and net interest spread. 

Asset-Liability Management and Market Risk Sensitivity 

Our earnings and the economic value of equity vary in relation to the behavior of interest rates and the accompanying fluctuations in market prices of certain of our financial instruments. We define interest rate risk as the risk to earnings and equity arising from the behavior of interest rates. These behaviors include increases and decreases in interest rates as well as continuation of the current interest rate environment. 

Our interest rate risk principally consists of reprice, option, basis, and yield curve risk. Reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing characteristics of asset and liability portfolios. Option risk arises from embedded options in the investment and loan portfolios such as investment securities calls and loan prepayment options. Option risk also exists since deposit customers may withdraw funds at their discretion in response to general market conditions, competitive alternatives to existing accounts or other factors. The exercise of such options may result in higher costs or lower revenue. Basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices, which subsequently result in narrowing spreads on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Basis risk also exists in administered rate liabilities, such as interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts where the price sensitivity of such products may vary relative to general markets rates. Yield curve risk refers to adverse consequences of nonparallel shifts in the yield curves of various market indices that impact our assets and liabilities. 

We use simulation analysis as a primary method to assess earnings at risk and equity at risk due to assumed changes in interest rates. Management uses the results of its various simulation analyses in combination with other data and observations to formulate strategies designed to maintain interest rate risk within risk tolerances. 

Simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including, but not limited to, the timing of cash flows such as the terms of contractual agreements, investment security calls, loan prepayment speeds, deposit attrition rates, the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates, and the behavior of interest rates and spreads. Equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows. Simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes. Key simulation assumptions are subject to sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk. Model assumptions are reviewed by our Assumptions Committee. 

Earnings at risk is defined as the percentage change in net interest income due to assumed changes in interest rates. Earnings at risk is generally used to assess interest rate risk over relatively short time horizons. 

Equity at risk is defined as the percentage change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value. The discounted present value of all cash flows represents our economic value of equity. Equity at risk is generally considered a measure of the long-term interest rate exposures of the balance sheet at a point in time. 

The earnings simulation models take into account our contractual agreements with regard to investments, loans, deposits, borrowings, and derivatives as well as a number of behavioral assumptions applied to certain assets and liabilities. 

Mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist of forward sales contracts and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans. These derivatives involve underlying items, such as interest rates, and are designed to mitigate risk. Derivatives are also used to hedge mortgage servicing rights. For additional information see Note 28&#8212;Derivative Financial Instruments in the consolidated financial statements. 

From time to time, we execute interest rate swaps to hedge some of our interest rate risks. Under these arrangements, the Company enters into a variable rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement. The swap agreement effectively converts the client&#8217;s variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan. The Company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a third-party dealer to offset its exposure on the customer swap. The Company may also execute interest rate swap agreements that are not specific to client loans. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have such agreements. For additional information on these derivatives refer to Note 28&#8212;Derivative Financial Instruments in the consolidated financial statements. 

Our interest rate risk key indicators are applied to a static balance sheet using forward rates from the Moody&#8217;s Baseline Scenario. The Company will also use other rate forecasts, including, but not limited to, Moody&#8217;s Consensus Scenario. This Base Case Scenario assumes the maturity composition of asset and liability rollover volumes is modeled to approximately replicate current consolidated balance sheet characteristics throughout the simulation. These treatments are consistent with the Company&#8217;s goal of assessing current interest rate risk embedded in its current balance sheet. The Base Case Scenario assumes that maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at prices referencing forward rates derived from the selected rate forecast consistent with current balance sheet pricing characteristics. Key rate drivers are used to price assets and liabilities with sensitivity assumptions used to price non-maturity deposits. The sensitivity assumptions for the pricing of non-maturity deposits are subjected to sensitivity analysis no less frequently than on an annual basis. 

Interest rate shocks are applied to the Base Case on an instantaneous basis. The range of interest rate shocks will include upward and downward movements of rates through 400 basis points in 100 basis point increments. At times, market conditions may result in assumed rate movements that will be deemphasized. For example, during a period of ultra-low interest rates, certain downward rate shocks may be impractical. The model simulation results produced from the Base Case Scenario and related instantaneous shocks for changes in net interest income and changes in the economic value of equity are referred to as the Core Scenario Analysis and constitute the policy key risk indicators for interest rate risk when compared to risk tolerances. 

Relative to prior modeling and disclosures, management revised its deposit beta assumptions higher due to the rapid increase in interest rates and expected further increases. Previous beta assumptions reflected sensitivities across full interest rate cycles. The beta assumptions were revised during the second quarter of 2022 to recognize that interest rates have risen while the Company&#8217;s cost of deposits have increased slightly. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the federal funds target rate increased 125 basis points while the Company&#8217;s total deposit cost increased 13 basis points. The revised beta assumptions reflect the acceleration of deposit cost increases associated with the expected increase in short term rates after December 31, 2022. These beta assumptions, when combined with the minimal increase in deposit costs since the federal funds rate began to rise in March 2022, reflect management&#8217;s estimates across the entire current rising rate cycle 

The following interest rate risk metrics are derived from analysis using the Moody&#8217;s Consensus Scenario published in January 2023 as the Base Case. The consensus forecast projects an inverted yield curve through year 1. As of December 31, 2022, the earnings simulations indicated that the year 1 impact of an instantaneous 100 basis point 

increase / decrease in rates would result in an estimated 2.2% increase (up 100) and 2.9% decrease (down 100) in net interest income. 

We use Economic Value of Equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) analysis as an indicator of the extent to which the present value of our capital could change, given potential changes in interest rates. This measure also assumes a static balance sheet (Base Case Scenario) with rate shocks applied as described above. At December 31, 2022, the percentage change in EVE due to a 100-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates was 1.2% decrease and 1.1% decrease, respectively. The percentage changes in EVE due to a 200-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates were 2.8% decrease and 4.7% decrease, respectively. The interest rate shock analysis results for EVE sensitivities are unusual as the benefits of repricing assets are mitigated by increasing deposit costs, and downward shocks are constrained on various balance sheet categories due to the inability to price products below floors or zero. This is particularly meaningful given the cost of deposits as of December 31, 2022. 

The analysis below reflects a Base Case and shocked scenarios that assume a static balance sheet projection where volume is added to maintain balances consistent with current levels, except for PPP loans that are not assumed to be replaced. Base Case assumes new and repricing volumes reference forward rates derived from the Moody&#8217;s Consensus rate forecast. Instantaneous, parallel, and sustained interest rate shocks are applied to the Base Case scenario over a one-year time horizon.

##TABLE_END LIBOR Transition 

In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intended to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR at the end of 2021. On March 5, 2021, the FCA confirmed that all LIBOR settings would either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021 for the one-week and two-month US dollar settings and immediately after June 30, 2023 for all remaining US dollar settings. 

&#8203; 

The Alternative Reference Rates Committee proposed Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) as its preferred rate as an alternative to LIBOR and proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR. Organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. As noted within Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors of the this Form 10-K for the year ended 2022, we hold instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR including floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and hedges, and other financial instruments but is not able to currently predict the associated financial impact of the transition to an alternative reference rate. 

&#8203; 

We have established a cross-functional LIBOR transition working group that has (1) assessed the Company&#39;s current exposure to LIBOR indexed instruments and the data, systems and processes that will be impacted; (2) established a detailed implementation plan; and (3) developed a formal governance structure for the transition. The Company has developed and continues to implement various proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of customers, which include: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; The adoption and ongoing implementation of fallback provisions that provide for the determination of replacement rates for LIBOR-linked financial products. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; The adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, consistent with guidance provided by the U.S. regulators, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, and GSEs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; The selection of SOFR indices as the replacement indices, and successful completion of systems testing using the SOFR replacement indices. ##TABLE_END 

The Company discontinued quoting LIBOR on September 30, 2021 and discontinued originating new products linked to LIBOR on December 31, 2021.

&#8203; 

We intend to use the provisions of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act passed by Congress and signed in to law by the President in March 2022 for certain contracts referencing LIBOR. The Act provides for the use of SOFR as the replacement index with a spread adjustment when the remaining LIBOR indices are discontinued. The Act applies when there is no contract provision addressing the loss of LIBOR and may be used otherwise as well, provided the contract does not provide for a specific replacement index. This aligns with the plan of action currently under implementation by the Company. The final rule implementing the Act was released on December 22, 2022. 

&#8203; 

The Company continues to evaluate its financial and operational infrastructure in its effort to transition all financial and strategic processes, systems, and models to reference rates other than LIBOR. The Company is in the process of developing and implementing processes to educate client-facing associates and coordinate communications with customers regarding the transition. 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had the following exposures to LIBOR: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Approximately $5.1 billion of total outstanding loans referencing LIBOR. Of this amount, $5.0 billion have maturities occurring after the LIBOR discontinuation date of June 30, 2023. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Approximately $16.6 billion in interest rate swaps that are indexed to LIBOR with a gross positive fair value of $61.1 million, inclusive of $824.3 million of variation margin settlements, and a gross negative fair value of $884.8 million. However, the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. Therefore, the transition to LIBOR will have no hedge accounting impact as changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. Moreover, the exposure of both sides of these swaps is presented in these figures. These exposures are intended to offset each other. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Trust preferred securities that reference LIBOR and had a total principal balance of $118.6 million. These securities have maturities ranging from October 7, 2033 through March 14, 2037. ##TABLE_END Asset Credit Risk and Concentrations 

The quality of our interest- earning assets is maintained through our management of certain concentrations of credit risk. We review each individual earning asset including investment securities and loans for credit risk. To facilitate this review, we have established credit and investment policies that include credit limits, documentation, periodic examination, and follow- up. In addition, we examine these portfolios for exposure to concentration in any one industry, government agency, or geographic location. 

Loan and Deposit Concentration 

We have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers. We have no significant portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries. Furthermore, we attempt to avoid making loans that, in an aggregate amount, exceed 10% of total loans to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no aggregated loan concentrations of this type. We do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us. We do not have material foreign loans or deposits. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

Each category of earning assets has a certain degree of credit risk. We use various techniques to measure credit risk. Credit risk in the investment portfolio can be measured through bond ratings published by independent agencies. In the investment securities portfolio, the investments consist of U.S. government-sponsored entity securities, tax- free securities, or other securities having ratings of &#8220;AAA&#8221; to &#8220;Not Rated&#8221;. All securities, with the exception of those that are not rated, were rated by at least one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. The credit risk of the loan portfolio can be measured by historical experience. We maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with credit policies that we have established. Although the Bank has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of our borrowers&#8217; abilities to honor their contracts is dependent upon economic conditions within our geographic footprint and the surrounding regions. 

We consider concentrations of credit to exist when, pursuant to regulatory guidelines, the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents 25% of total Tier 1 capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses of the Company, or $1.0 billion at December 31, 2022. Based on this criteria, we had eight such credit concentrations at December 31, 2022, including loans on hotels and motels of $1.0 billion, loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings (except mini-warehouses) of $5.7 billion, loans secured by owner occupied office buildings (including medical office buildings) of $1.9 billion, loans secured by owner occupied nonresidential buildings (excluding office buildings) of $1.7 billion, loans to lessors of residential buildings (investment properties and multi-family) of $1.8 billion, loans secured by 1 st mortgage 1-4 family owner occupied residential property (including condos and home equity lines) of $5.4 billion, loans secured by jumbo (original loans greater than $548,250) 1 st mortgage 1-4 family owner occupied residential property of $2.3 billion and loans secured by business assets including accounts receivable, inventory and equipment of $2.1 billion. The risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time. The loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard ACL methodology.

After the adoption of CECL in the first quarter of 2020, banking regulators established guidelines for calculating credit concentrations. Banking regulators set the guidelines for construction, land development and other land loans to total less than 100% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CDL concentration ratio) and for total commercial real estate loans (construction, land development and other land loans along with other non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans) to total less than 300% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CRE concentration ratio). Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank&#8217;s total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL. At December 31, 2022, the Bank&#8217;s CDL concentration ratio was 64.8% and its CRE concentration ratio was 249.0%. At Dece mber 31, 2021, the Bank&#8217;s CDL concentration ratio was 55.2% and its CRE concentration ratio was 238.5%. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank was below the established regulatory guidelines. When a bank&#8217;s ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines, banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by Bank management. Therefore, we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes. 

Effect of Inflation and Changing Prices 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the measure of financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars, without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power over time due to inflation. Unlike most other industries, the majority of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant effect on a financial institution&#8217;s performance than does the effect of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily change in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. 

While the effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as is its influence on those businesses which have large investments in plant and inventories, it does have an effect. During periods of high inflation, there are normally corresponding increases in money supply, and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets, loans and deposits. Also, general increases in the prices of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses. Inflation also affects our bank&#8217;s customers and may result in an indirect effect on our bank&#8217;s business. 

Contractual Obligations 

The following table presents payment schedules for certain of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022. Long-term debt obligations totaling $392.3 million include trust preferred junior subordinated debt and corporate subordinated debt. Operating and finance lease obligations of $136.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, pertain to banking facilities. Certain lease agreements include payment of property taxes and insurance and contain various renewal options. Additional information regarding leases is contained in Note 21 of the audited consolidated financial statements.
