 Item 1. Business . 

Overview 

South State Corporation (&#8220;We,&#8221; &#8220;Our,&#8221; &#8220;SSC&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a financial holding company headquartered in Winter Haven, Florida, and was incorporated under the laws of South Carolina in 1985. We provide a wide range of banking services and products to our customers through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, South State Bank, National Association (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), a national banking association, from our headquarters branch in Winter Haven, Florida and, as of December 31, 2020, a 285 branch network located throughout Florida, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. 

We also operate, through the Bank, a correspondent banking and capital markets service division for over 700 small and medium sized community banks throughout the United States. Based primarily in Atlanta, Georgia and Birmingham, Alabama, this division earns commissions on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities. The Bank also operates South State Advisory, Inc., a wholly owned registered investment advisor, which offers support to the Bank&#8217;s Wealth line of business. 

Through the merger with CenterState Bank Corporation (&#8220;CSFL&#8221;) in the second quarter of 2020, the Bank also owns CBI Holding Company, LLC (&#8220;CBI&#8221;), which in turn owns Corporate Billing, LLC (&#8220;Corporate Billing&#8221;), a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers nationwide. Also, through the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020, the holding company operates SSB Insurance Corp., a captive insurance subsidiary pursuant to Section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code and R4ALL, Inc., which manages a troubled loan purchased from the Bank to its eventual disposition. We do not engage in any significant operations other than the ownership of our banking subsidiary. 

At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $37.8 billion in assets, $24.7 billion in loans, $30.7 billion in deposits, $4.6 billion in shareholders&#8217; equity, and a market capitalization of approximately $5.1 billion.

Our Bank began operating in 1934 in Orangeburg, South Carolina and has maintained our ability to provide high quality customer service while also leveraging our size to offer some products more common to larger banks. We have pursued a strategy founded under our guiding principles of soundness, profitability and growth that relies on organic growth supplemented by the acquisition of select financial institutions or branches in certain market areas.

On June 7, 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of CSFL of Winter Haven, Florida, the bank holding company for CenterState Bank, N.A. (&#8220;CSB&#8221;), in a stock transaction. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger Agreement, (i) CSFL merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;), and (ii) immediately following the Merger, South State Bank (&#8220;SSB&#8221;), a 

South Carolina banking corporation and wholly owned bank subsidiary of the Company, merged with and into CSB, a national banking association and wholly owned bank subsidiary of CSFL, with CSB continuing as the surviving bank (the &#8220;Bank Merger&#8221;). In connection with the Bank Merger, CSB changed its name to &#8220;South State Bank, National Association.&#8221; CSFL common shareholders received 0.3001 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock in exchange for each share of CSFL stock resulting in the Company issuing 37,271,069 shares of its common stock. In total, the purchase price for CSFL was $2.26 billion including the value of the conversion of CSFL&#8217;s outstanding warrants, stock options and restricted stock units totaling $10.3 million. 

Our principal executive offices are located at, and our mailing address is, 1101 First Street South, Suite 202, Winter Haven, Florida 33880. Our telephone number is (863) 293-4710.

Our revenue is primarily derived from interest on, and fees received in connection with, real estate and other loans, interest and dividends from investment securities and short-term investments, commissions on bond sales, fees from hedging services, and gains from the sale of residential mortgage loans. The principal sources of funds for our lending activities are customer deposits, repayment of loans, and the sale and maturity of investment securities. Our principal expenses are interest paid on deposits and operating and general administrative expenses. 

As is the case with banking institutions generally, our operations are materially and significantly influenced by the real estate market, general economic conditions, and by the tax, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and state government and regulatory agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). Deposit flows and costs of funds are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest. Lending activities are affected by the demand for financing of real estate and other types of loans, which in turn is affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting local demand and availability of funds, including tax rates and regulatory structure. We face strong competition in the attraction of deposits (our primary source of lendable funds) and in the origination of loans. See &#8220;Competition.&#8221; 

Products and Services 

Lending Activities 

Our loan portfolio includes commercial real estate loans, residential real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and consumer loans. The principal risk associated with each category of loans we make is the creditworthiness of the borrower. Borrower creditworthiness is affected by general economic conditions and the attributes of the borrower and the borrower&#8217;s market or industry. Attributes of the relevant business market or industry include the competitive environment, customer and supplier availability, the threat of substitutes and barriers to entry and exit. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans. As of December 31, 2020, $13.3 billion, or 54%, of our loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by commercial real estate (including owner occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate and construction and land development lending). We offer construction financing, acquisition financing or refinancing of properties, commercial lines of credit and other loans that are secured by commercial real estate.

Residential Real Estate Loans. As of December 31, 2020, $5.4 billion, or 22%, of our loan portfolio consisted of residential real estate loans. We provide one-to-four family residential real estate loans with terms ranging from 10 to 30 years, with either fixed or adjustable interest rates and home equity lines. It is not our normal business practice to originate subprime loans. Loans are closed-end first lien loans for purposes of property purchased, or for refinancing existing loans. The majority of our loans are owner occupied, full documentation loans. 

Commercial and Industrial Loans (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;). As of December 31, 2020, $5.0 billion, or 20%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial loans. Our C&#38;I loans include lines of credit, acquisition finance credit facilities and other types of commercial credit, and typically have maturities of five years or less. 

Other Consumer Loans. As of December 31, 2020, $894 million, or 4%, of our loan portfolio consisted of other types of consumer loans. We offer consumer loans to our customers for personal, family and household purposes, including auto, boat and personal installment loans.

We believe we have a strong team of consumer and commercial bankers to execute on our client-centered, relationship-driven banking model. Our commercial banking team consists of experienced professionals that use an 

advisory approach that emphasizes understanding each client&#8217;s business and offering a broad suite of loan, deposit and treasury management products and services. Our consumer banking team consists of experienced professionals that focus on knowing their individual clients in order to best meet their financial needs, offering a full complement of loan, deposit and online banking solutions. We generally do business with clients located in the areas served by our branches, and we focus our marketing efforts on these areas. 

Deposit Products, Treasury Services and Other Funding Sources 

We offer our customers a variety of deposit products and services, including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, other deposit accounts and treasury and merchant services, through multiple channels, including our extensive network of 285 full-service branches, as of December 31, 2020, and our online, mobile and telephone banking platforms. As of December 31, 2020, our deposit portfolio was comprised of 32% noninterest-bearing deposits and 68% interest bearing deposits. We intend to continue our efforts to provide funding for our business from customer relationship deposits. 

Deposit flows are significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, internal pricing decisions and competition. Our deposits are primarily obtained from depositors located around our branch footprint, and we believe that we have attractive opportunities to capture additional retail and commercial deposits in our markets. In order to attract and retain deposits, we rely on providing quality service, offering a suite of retail and commercial products and services and introducing new products and services that meet our customers&#8217; needs as they evolve. 

In addition to traditional banking activities and the other products and services specified above, we provide a broad array of financial services to our customers, including debit card and mobile and funds transfer products and services, and treasury management services, including merchant services, automated clearing house services, lock-box services, remote deposit capture services and other treasury services.

Correspondent Banking 

Our correspondent banking and capital markets segment operates as a division within our Bank. Its primary revenue generating activities are related to the capital markets division which includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities. Income generated related to the correspondent banking services includes spread income earned on correspondent bank deposits (i.e. federal funds purchased) and fees generated from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services, asset/liability consulting services, international wires, clearing and corporate checking account services and other correspondent banking related services. The fees derived from the correspondent banking services are less volatile than those generated through the capital markets group. The customer base includes small to medium size financial institutions located throughout the United States. 

On October 14, 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire Duncan-Williams, Inc., a full-service broker dealer that engages in business that is complementary to that of our correspondent division. The transaction closed on February 1, 2021.

Wealth Management 

Through the Bank and South State Advisory, Inc., we offer wealth management and other fiduciary and private banking services targeted to affluent clients, including individuals, business owners, families and professional service companies. In addition to fiduciary and investment management fee income, we believe these services enable us to build new relationships and expand existing relationships to grow our deposits and loans. Through our wealth management line of business, we offer financial planning, retirement services and trust and investment management for affluent clients as well as clients with more modest resources. We offer a wide range of investment alternatives, including certificates of deposits, mutual funds, annuities, individual retirement accounts, money market accounts and other financial products. 

Mortgage Banking 

We have a mortgage line of business which originates single-family home loans and sells a majority of those 

mortgages into the secondary market of which the majority are sold with servicing rights released. We also have a SBA 7(a) line of business whereby we routinely sell the government guaranteed portion of the SBA loans to investors with the unguaranteed portion of the loan and the servicing rights retained. 

Acquisition Strategy 

Our business growth, profitability and market share have been enhanced by engaging in strategic mergers and acquisitions either within or contiguous to our existing footprint. Our acquisition strategy focuses on banking institutions that are consistent with our guiding principles of soundness, profitability and growth and 

##TABLE_START &#8226; are a good fit with our culture; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; are strategically attractive by enhancing our footprint, allowing for cost savings and economies of scale, or providing market diversification, or otherwise may be strategically compelling; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; have been determined to meet our risk appetite and profile; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; meet our financial criteria. ##TABLE_END 

We expect to continue to assess future opportunities of financial companies using these criteria, based on market and other conditions. 

Competition 

Our profitability depends principally on our ability to compete effectively in the markets in which we conduct business. In the financial services industry, market demands, technological and regulatory changes and economic pressures have increased competition among banks, as well as other financial institutions. Competition may further intensify as additional companies enter the markets where we conduct business and we enter mature markets in accordance with our expansion strategy.

We experience strong competition from both bank and non-bank competitors. We compete with national banks, super-regional banks, smaller community banks, nontraditional internet based banks, credit unions, insurance companies and government sponsored entities. We also compete with other financial intermediaries and investment alternatives such as mortgage companies, credit card issuers, leasing companies, finance companies, money market mutual funds, brokerage firms, governmental and corporation bonds, and other securities firms. 

We encounter strong competition in making loans and attracting deposits. We compete with other financial institutions to offer customers competitive interest rates on deposit accounts, competitive interest rates charged on loans and other credit products and reasonable service charges. In addition, we also compete based on the quality and scope of the services we provide and the convenience of our banking facilities, compared to our competitors. The larger national and super-regional banks may have significantly greater lending limits and may offer additional products. However, by emphasizing customer service and by providing a wide variety of services, we believe that our Bank has generally been able to compete successfully with our competitors, regardless of their size. 

Technological advances have made it possible for our competitors, including nonbank competitors, to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including online deposit accounts, electronic payment processing and marketplace lending, without having a physical presence where their customers are located. In addition, many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and federally insured banks. In many cases, our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits and offer certain services that we do not currently provide. 

Legislation has continued to heighten the competitive environment in which financial institutions must conduct their business, and the potential for competition among financial institutions of all types has increased significantly. To compete, we rely upon specialized services, responsive handling of customer needs, and personal contacts by our officers, directors, and staff. 

&#8203; 

Human Capital Management 

We consider our relationship with our employees instrumental to the success of our business. We value our employees by investing in a healthy work-life balance, competitive compensation and benefit packages, and a team-oriented environment centered on professional service and open communication amongst employees. The Board of Directors oversees the strategic management of our human capital resources. The Human Resources Department&#8217;s day-to-day responsibility is managing our human capital resources.

Core Values and Culture 

A strategic priority for the Company is to develop a dynamic, high performing team by, in part, facilitating a culture that increases employee engagement, devotes resources to recruiting, developing and retaining talent, and recognizes the benefits of different perspectives and experiences. The Company&#8217;s core values, an essential cultural cornerstone, sets the course by which we intend to meet this goal through our interactions with each other, our customers and our suppliers:

##TABLE_START &#8226; Local Market Leadership - Our business model supports the unique character of the communities we serve and encourages decision-making by a banker that is closest to the customer. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; Long-Term Horizon - We think and act like owners and measure success over entire economic cycles. We prioritize soundness over short-term profitability and growth. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; Remarkable Experiences - We will make our customers&#8217; lives better by anticipating their needs and responding with a sense of urgency. Each of us has the freedom and responsibility to do the right thing for our customers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; Meaningful and Lasting Relationships - We communicate with candor and transparency. The relationship is more valuable than the transaction. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; Greater Purpose - We enable our team members to pursue their ultimate purpose in life &#8211; their personal faith, their family, their service to the community. ##TABLE_END 

Because we recognize the importance of encouraging an environment that inspires our employees to act consistently with the Company&#8217;s core values, we introduced a board-level Culture Committee in June 2020. This Board committee is charged with overseeing the internal and external culture and values messaging, implementing a program for continuing to build and retain a diverse and inclusive employee base, developing a program to recruit, train and retain the leadership and talent necessary to deliver the Company&#8217;s vision, and maintaining an employee engagement program with clear objectives.

The Company&#8217;s Code of Ethics, which also addresses conflicts of interest and self-dealing, applies to all directors, officers and employees, each of whom are expected to adhere to it in every transaction. The Company believes that each employee is entitled to work in an atmosphere and environment free of discrimination and unlawful harassment. As a result, the Company has established and communicated to all employees a reporting structure for reporting incidents of harassment or discrimination. The Company&#8217;s Whistleblower Policy provides employees, customers, vendors and others with a confidential mechanism to express concerns or complaints regarding the Company&#8217;s accounting, internal accounting controls, auditing matters, securities law compliance, or any provision of federal law relating to fraud against shareholders. Other complaints or concerns, such as relating to human resources matters, may also be submitted confidentially through the whistleblower process, and any such matters are referred to our Human Resources Department or other departments, as appropriate, for resolution.

Demographic Information 

As of December 31, 2020, we had 5,184 full-time equivalent employees (compared to 2,547 as of the same date in 2019), 127 part-time employees and 6 seasonal employees. Over 99% of our employees are located in the Bank&#8217;s 6-state branch footprint of Florida (36%), South Carolina (34%), Georgia (17%), North Carolina (6%), Alabama (6%) and Virginia (1%). To date, none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and all but one employee live in the United States. During fiscal year 2020, we hired 605 employees (excluding employees via merger or acquisition), and our voluntary turnover rate was 16%.

Diversity and Inclusion 

We strive to build a powerful and diverse team of employees, knowing we are better together with our combined wisdom and intellect. With a commitment to equality, inclusion and workplace diversity, we focus on understanding, accepting, and valuing the differences between people. In 2020, we hired a Director of Corporate Stewardship, reporting to the CEO, whose responsibilities include enterprise diversity, environmental and social governance, community development, management development, and the Employee Sunshine Fund.

The Company&#8217;s diversity initiatives include establishing programs that support both personnel diversity and vendor diversity so that both our workforce and the third parties that supply our needs reflect the communities we serve. In addition to our talent acquisition efforts described below, as part of our collegiate diversity and inclusion outreach efforts, we contributed to a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (&#8220;DEI&#8221;) fund established to support the recruitment, retention, and success of diverse students, and to mitigate financial challenges experienced by underrepresented minority students that threaten their pursuit of academic achievements. Through community development and outreach, employees volunteer their time by serving as board, finance and loan committee members of various agencies and organizations, including organizations that serve minority communities, as well as minority-owned small businesses.

Talent Acquisition, Retention and Employee Development 

Recruitment is an essential part of managing our human capital resources. We seek to hire well-qualified employees who are also a good fit for our value system. Through our commercial banking internships and management training programs, we recruit from talented, diverse pool of students from local colleges and universities. To complement other recruitment efforts, our Talent Acquisition team is committed to attending job fairs hosted by Historical Black Colleges and Universities within our footprint. Additionally, the Talent Acquisition team partners closely with regional line of business leadership to network and recruit in-market, experienced and diverse talent in metropolitan markets within our footprint who bring with them a requisite skill set, professional background and aptitude to help grow the Bank and position our teams to support and lead a larger financial institution in the future.

We encourage and support the growth and development of our employees and, when possible, seek to fill positions by promotion and transfer from within the organization. We invest in the growth and development of our employees by providing opportunities to participate in continuing education courses that are relevant to the banking industry and their job function within the Company. Our internal Corporate University offers a suite of leadership development programs to support various levels of leadership experience and expertise with graduated topics designed to engage and develop leaders by improving business acumen and offering 360 degree reviews, individual coaching opportunities and education on topics as varied as culture, communication styles and mentoring. Because the banking industry is highly regulated, we also require employees to complete annual compliance training, the classes for which are selected based on each employee&#8217;s actual job responsibilities.

Employee retention helps us operate efficiently. We believe that we offer competitive salaries, and many of our officers and key employees participate in the Company&#8217;s incentive program, which offers short-term cash incentives to reward annual performance and long-term incentives designed to reward sustainable shareholder value creation and encourage talent retention. In addition, we provide many of our employees with a comprehensive employee benefit program that includes: group life, health, dental and vision insurance; prescription benefits; flexible spending accounts; educational opportunities; an employee stock purchase plan; deferred compensation plans for officers and key employees; and a 401(k) plan with a Company match. The Company sponsors a broad leave plan that may be used for vacation, personal use and illness, and it awards paid leave based on tenure of service and title. The Company-sponsored Employee Stock Purchase Plan encourages our employees to invest in the Company by offering shares at a discounted price to participants.

Employee Health, Wellness and Safety 

The safety and health of our employees is a top priority. The COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique challenge with regard to maintaining employee safety while continuing successful operations. To ensure a safely-distanced working environment for employees performing customer-facing activities at branches and operations centers, through teamwork and the adaptability of our management and staff, we were able to transition, over a short period of time, 91% of our non-branch employees to effectively working from remote locations, and we closed all branch lobbies and transitioned to drive-thru only operations for approximately 7 months in 2020. All employees are asked not to come to work when they 

experience signs or symptoms of a possible COVID-19 illness, and we have provided additional paid time off to cover compensation during such absences. We conducted two surveys during 2020 to better understand the changing needs of our employees in light of the pandemic (i.e., challenges posed by a lack of childcare, virtual school or caring for family members), and we have offered our employees increased flexibility to perform their responsibilities in response. Because our employees&#8217; needs change as the country&#8217;s pandemic response remains fluid, we, led by our Business Continuity Team, continue to evaluate the changing COVID-19 landscape and consider processes that reduce the risk to our employees, customers and vendors while continuing to provide essential banking services.

Effect of Governmental Policies 

Our earnings and business are and will be affected by the policies of various regulatory authorities of the United States, especially the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve, among other things, seeks to influence interest rates and the supply of money and credit within the United States. Among the traditional methods that have been used to achieve this objective are open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate for bank borrowings, expanded access to funds for non-banks and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. The Federal Reserve has, as a response to the financial crisis, steeply increased the size of its balance sheet by buying securities and has paid interest on excess reserves held by banks at the Federal Reserve. Both the traditional and more recent methods are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, interest rates on loans and securities, and rates paid for deposits. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve are influenced by various factors, including inflation, unemployment, and short-term and long-term changes in the international trade balance and in the fiscal policies of the U.S. Government. Following a prolonged period in which the federal funds rate was stable or decreasing, the Federal Reserve began to increase this benchmark rate, but has more recently decreased its target federal funds rate to near zero in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, since the period during which the Federal Reserve increased the size of its balance sheet substantially above historical levels through the purchase of debt securities, the Federal Reserve has started to vary the size of its balance sheet, which might also affect interest rates. Future monetary policies, including whether the Federal Reserve will increase or decrease the federal funds rate and whether or at what pace it will reduce or increase the size of its balance sheet, and the effect of such policies on the future business and earnings of the Company and our subsidiary bank cannot be predicted. 

Supervision and Regulation 

We are extensively regulated under federal and state law. The following is a brief summary of certain aspects of that regulation that are material to us, and does not purport to be a complete description of all regulations that affect us or all aspects of those regulations. To the extent particular statutory and regulatory provisions are described, the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal levels. The likelihood and timing of any changes in these laws and regulations, and the impact such changes may have on the Company and the Bank, are difficult to ascertain. In addition to laws and regulations, bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to the Company or the Bank. A change in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory guidance, or in the manner such laws, regulations or regulatory guidance are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s business, operations, and earnings. Supervision, regulation, and examination of banks by regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and customers, the deposit insurance fund and the U.S. banking and financial system rather than shareholders. 

Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. As described in further detail below, the Company and the Bank have become subject to additional regulatory requirements as a result of the growth of their assets. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) and its implementing regulations. While there have been some changes in the post financial crisis framework applicable to the Company, the Company expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision. It is possible that the intensity of regulation and supervision will be higher in the Biden Administration. 

We are also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the SEC, as well as the rules of Nasdaq that apply to companies with securities listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. 

Regulation of the Company 

We are registered as a bank holding company with the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;) and have elected to be a financial holding company. As a financial holding company, we are subject to comprehensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve and are subject to its regulatory reporting requirements. Federal law subjects financial holding companies, such as the Company, to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. 

As a financial holding company, we are permitted to engage in, and be affiliated with companies engaging in, a broader range of activities than those permitted for a bank holding company. Bank holding companies are generally restricted to engaging in the business of banking, managing or controlling banks and certain other activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be related closely to banking. Financial holding companies may also engage in activities that are considered to be financial in nature, as well as those incidental or complementary to financial activities, including certain insurance underwriting activities. We and the Bank must each remain &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well-managed&#8221; and the Bank must receive a Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) rating of at least &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; at its most recent examination in order for us to maintain our status as a financial holding company. In addition, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a financial holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any bank subsidiary of that financial holding company. 

A financial holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to maintain resources adequate to support its bank. The term &#8220;source of financial strength&#8221; has been defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress. The appropriate federal banking agency for the depository institution (in this case the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or &#8220;OCC&#8221;) may require reports from the Company to assess its ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the source-of-strength requirements by requiring the holding company to provide financial assistance to the Bank if its capital were to become impaired. If the Company fails to provide such assistance within three months, it could be ordered to sell its stock of the Bank to cover the deficiency. Any capital loans by the Company to the Bank would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of the Bank. In the event of the Company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. 

The BHC Act requires that a financial holding company obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any additional bank or bank holding company, (ii) taking any action that causes an additional bank or bank holding company to become a subsidiary of the financial holding company, or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. The Federal Reserve may not approve any such transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the United States, or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider (1) the financial and managerial resources of the companies involved, including pro forma capital ratios; (2) the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system; (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the companies&#8217; performance under the CRA; and (4) the effectiveness of the companies in combatting money laundering. We are permitted under applicable federal and state law to make out of state acquisitions and mergers of other banks and bank holding companies, subject to the requirements summarized above. 

Federal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company and a bank that a person may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators. The overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company and a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of 

another type of corporation. Consequently, shareholders of the Company may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies. Federal law also imposes restrictions on acquisitions of stock in a bank holding company or a national bank. Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act and the regulations thereunder, a person or group must give advance notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company, such as the Company, and the OCC before acquiring control of any national bank, such as the Bank. Upon receipt of such notice, the bank regulatory agencies may approve or disapprove the acquisition. The Change in Bank Control Act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a member or group acquires a certain percentage or more of a bank holding company&#8217;s or bank&#8217;s voting stock, or if one or more other control factors set forth in the Act are present. As a result, a person or entity generally must provide prior notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring the power to vote 10% or more of our outstanding common stock. Investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of our stock. 

Regulation of the Bank 

The Bank is a national bank subject to comprehensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC and is subject to its regulatory reporting requirements. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC and, accordingly, the Bank is also subject to certain FDIC regulations and the FDIC has backup examination authority and some enforcement powers over the Bank. The Bank also is subject to certain Federal Reserve regulations. These regulations include limitations on loans to a single borrower and to its directors, officers and employees; restrictions on the opening and closing of branch offices; the maintenance of required capital and liquidity ratios; the granting of credit under equal and fair conditions; the disclosure of the costs and terms of such credit, requirements to maintain reserves against deposits and loans, limitation on the types of investment that may be made and requirements governing risk management practices. 

The Bank also is subject to restrictions on its ability to lend to and engage in other transactions with the Company and the Bank&#8217;s other affiliates. Under these provisions, individual loans or other extensions of credit between the Bank and the Company or any nonbank affiliate generally are limited to 10% of the Bank&#8217;s capital and surplus, and all such transactions between the Bank and either the Company or any nonbank affiliate are limited to 20% of the Bank&#8217;s capital and surplus. Loans and other extensions of credit from the Bank to any affiliate generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. In addition, any transaction between the Bank and any affiliate are required to be on arm&#8217;s length terms and conditions. The definition of &#8220;extension of credit&#8221; for these purposes includes credit exposures arising from a derivative transaction, a repurchase or reverse repurchase agreement and a securities lending or borrowing transaction. Federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on loans and other extensions of credit by FDIC-insured banks, such as the Bank, to their directors, executive officers and principal shareholders. These restrictions have not had a material impact on the Company or the Bank. 

Federal Reserve rules require depository institutions, such as the Bank, to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts, primarily NOW and regular checking accounts. Effective March 26, 2020, the reserve has been suspended with no reserve requirements. These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve. 

The Bank is permitted under federal law to branch on a de novo basis across state lines where the laws of the state would permit banks chartered by that state to open a de novo branch. 

Supervision, Examination and Enforcement 

The Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC have broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority with regard to bank holding companies and banks, including the power to impose nonpublic supervisory agreements, issue cease and desist or removal orders, impose fines and other civil and criminal penalties, initiate injunctive actions, terminate deposit insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver. In general, these actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations, as well as engagement in unsafe and unsound practices, and certain of these actions also may be taken against an &#8220;institution affiliated party&#8221; as defined in the law. Specifically, the regulators may direct a bank holding company or bank to, among other things, increase its capital, sell subsidiaries or other assets, limit its dividends and distributions, restrict its growth or remove officers and directors. Supervision and examinations are confidential, and the outcomes of these actions may not be made public. 

We also are supervised and examined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) with respect to 

consumer protection laws and regulations.

FDIC Insurance Assessments and Depositor Preference 

The deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to the limits under applicable law, which currently are set at $250,000 for accounts under the same name and title. The Bank is subject to deposit insurance premium assessments. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system. Under this system, the assessment rates for an insured depository institution vary according to the level of risk incurred in its activities. To arrive at an assessment rate for a banking institution, the FDIC places it in one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels and supervisory ratings. In the case of those institutions in the lowest risk category, the FDIC further determines its assessment rate based on certain specified financial ratios or, if applicable, long-term debt ratings. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. Under the current system, premiums are assessed quarterly. The FDIC has published guidelines on the adjustment of assessment rates for certain institutions. In addition, insured depository institutions have been required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on the obligations issued by the Financing Corporation to fund the closing and disposal of failed thrift institutions by the Resolution Trust Corporation. 

The FDIC uses a performance score and loss-severity score to calculate the Bank&#8217;s initial FDIC assessment rate. In calculating these scores, the FDIC uses the Bank&#8217;s capital level and regulatory supervisory ratings and certain financial measures to assess the Bank&#8217;s ability to withstand asset-related and funding related stress, and make certain adjustments based on risk factors that are not adequately captured in these calculations. 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a bank&#8217;s federal regulatory agency. Deposits and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against insured depository institutions are afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution, including federal funds and letters of credit, in the liquidation or other resolution of that institution by any receiver appointed by federal authorities. These priority creditors include the FDIC. 

Dividend Restrictions 

The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries and has in the past relied on dividends from the Bank as its primary source of liquidity. There are limitations on the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company, as well as by the Company to its shareholders. 

The OCC has the general authority to limit the dividends paid by the Bank if such payment may be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. The Bank may not pay dividends from its paid-in surplus. All dividends must be paid out of undivided profits then on hand, after deducting expenses, including reserves for losses and bad debts. In addition, a national bank, such as the Bank, is prohibited from declaring a dividend on its shares of common stock until its surplus equals its stated capital, unless there has been transferred to surplus no less than one/tenth of the bank&#8217;s net profits of the preceding two consecutive half-year periods (in the case of an annual dividend). The approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. 

We and the Bank must maintain the applicable common equity Tier 1 (&#34;CET1&#34;) capital conservation buffer of 2.5% to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions, including dividends. For more information on the CET1 capital conservation buffer, see Part I Item 1. Supervision and Regulation &#8211; Capital Requirements. 

In addition, Federal Reserve policy provides that bank holding companies, such as the Company, should generally pay dividends to shareholders only if (i) the organization&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition; and (iii) the organization will continue to meet minimum capital adequacy ratios. The policy also provides that a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding company&#8217;s 

capital structure. Bank holding companies also are required to consult with the Federal Reserve before increasing dividends or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. Additionally, the Federal Reserve could prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by a bank holding company if it determines that payment of the dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. 

Capital Requirements 

We are required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels at each of the Company and the Bank. The federal banking agencies have issued substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital requirements to banking organizations they supervise. Under these requirements, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain certain capital standards based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The requirements also define the weights assigned to assets and off-balance sheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution&#8217;s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution&#8217;s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account by the federal banking agencies in assessing an institution&#8217;s overall capital adequacy. 

Under the applicable capital rules, the Company and the Bank are subject to the following risk-based capital ratios: a CET1 risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, which includes CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital, and a total capital ratio, which includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. CET1 is primarily comprised of the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of treasury stock, retained earnings, and certain qualifying minority interests, less certain adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets subject to temporary timing differences. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities, if applicable. Upon the completion of the Company merger with CSFL in June 2020, the Company&#8217;s trust preferred securities no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital. 

Tier 2 capital consists of instruments disqualified from Tier 1 capital, including qualifying subordinated debt, certain trust preferred securities, other preferred stock and certain hybrid capital instruments, and a limited amount of loan loss reserves up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, subject to certain eligibility criteria. For institutions, such as us, that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values are also included in Tier 2 capital. The capital rules also define the risk-weights assigned to assets and off-balance sheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules, including, for example, &#8220;high volatility&#8221; commercial real estate, past due assets, structured securities and equity holdings. 

The capital rules require a minimum CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%, a minimum overall Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%. In addition, the capital rules require a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each of the minimum capital ratio requirements (CET1, Tier 1, and total risk-based capital), which must be met for a bank or bank holding company to be able to pay dividends, engage in share buybacks or make discretionary bonus payments to executive management without automatic restriction. The capital conservation buffer is 2.50%, so a banking organization needs to maintain a CET1 capital ratio of at least 7%, a total Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.5% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.5% or it would be subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to its executive management. 

The leverage capital ratio, which serves as a minimum capital standard, is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average total assets, less goodwill and other disallowed intangible assets. The required minimum leverage ratio for all banks and bank holding companies is 4%. 

To be well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain the following capital ratios:

##TABLE_START &#8226; CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; Total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater. ##TABLE_END

The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the current capital rules. For purposes of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation Y, including determining whether a bank holding company meets the requirements to be a financial holding company, bank holding companies, such as the Company, must maintain a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater to be well-capitalized. If the Federal Reserve were to apply the same or a very similar well-capitalized standard to bank holding companies as that applicable to the Bank, the Company&#8217;s capital ratios as of December 31, 2020 would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard. The Federal Reserve may require bank holding companies, including the Company, to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company&#8217;s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. 

Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition. For example, only a well-capitalized depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the Company&#8217;s or the Bank&#8217;s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on its growth. 

As of December 31, 2020, the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s regulatory capital ratios were above the well-capitalized standards and met the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer. Please refer to the table below for a summary of the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to us during 2021.

##TABLE_END (1) Reflects the well-capitalized standard applicable to the Bank and the well-capitalized standard applicable to the Company under Federal Reserve Regulation Y.

(2) Amount greater than the highest of the minimum regulatory capital ratio, the minimum regulatory capital ratio plus the capital conservation buffer and the well-capitalized minimum, as applicable.

In addition, in December 2018, the U.S. federal banking agencies finalized rules that permit bank holding companies and banks to phase-in the day-one retained earnings impact of the new CECL accounting rule over a period of three years for regulatory capital purposes. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued another final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations that adopt CECL in the 2020 calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by the aforementioned three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of benefit during the initial two-year delay for a total five-year transition. The estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital (modified CECL transitional amount) is calculated as the sum of the day-one impact on retained earnings upon adoption of CECL (CECL transitional amount) and the calculated change in 

the ACL relative to the day-one ACL upon adoption of CECL multiplied by a scaling factor of 25%. The scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the ACL under CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology. The modified CECL transitional amount will be calculated each quarter for the first two years of the five-year transition. The amount of the modified CECL transition amount will be fixed as of December 31, 2021, and that amount will be subject to the three-year phase out. The Company chose the five-year transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from day one and the CECL difference for the first two years of application.

Safety and Soundness Guidelines 

The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards relating to internal controls, risk management, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. These guidelines in general require appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage specified risks and exposures. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and characterize compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer or employee, director or principal shareholder. In addition, the agencies have adopted regulations that authorize but do not require an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by the agency that it is not in compliance with any of the safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types, including those that may limit growth or capital distributions. 

Lending Standards and Guidance 

The federal banking agencies have adopted uniform regulations prescribing standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate. Under these regulations, all insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, must adopt and maintain written policies establishing appropriate limits and standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate. These policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards, prudent underwriting standards (including loan-to-value limits) that are clear and measurable, loan administration procedures, and documentation, approval and reporting requirements. The real estate lending policies must reflect consideration of the federal bank regulators&#8217; Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies. 

The federal banking agencies have also jointly issued guidance on &#8220;Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending&#8221; (the &#8220;Guidance&#8221;), which defines commercial real estate loans as exposures secured by raw land, land development and construction (including 1-4 family residential construction), multi-family property, and non-farm nonresidential property where the primary or a significant source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property (that is, loans for which 50% or more of the source of repayment comes from third party, non-affiliated, rental income) or the proceeds of the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the property. The Guidance requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify, monitor and control risks associated with real estate lending concentrations. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address key elements, including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. The required heightened risk management practices could include enhanced strategic planning, underwriting policies, risk management, internal controls, portfolio stress testing and risk exposure limits as well as appropriately designed compensation and incentive programs. Higher allowances for loan losses and capital levels may also be required. The Guidance states that the following metrics may indicate a concentration of commercial real estate loans, but that these metrics are neither limits nor a safe harbor: (1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of total risk-based capital; or (2) total reported loans secured by multi-family properties, non-farm non-residential properties (excluding those that are owner-occupied), and loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 300% or more of total risk-based capital and the bank&#8217;s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the pr ior 36 months. As of December 31, 2020, our total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land were 54% of the Bank&#8217;s total risk based capital and our total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm nonresidential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land were 230% of the Bank&#8217;s total risk based capital. 

&#8203; 

Consumer Protection Laws 

The Bank is subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect its customers. These consumer protection laws apply to a broad range of our activities and to various aspects of our business and include laws relating to interest rates, fair lending, disclosures of credit terms and estimated transaction costs to consumer borrowers, debt collection practices, the use of and the provision of information to consumer reporting agencies, and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. Administration of many of these consumer protection rules are the responsibility of the CFPB, which has exclusive supervisory authority over insured depository institutions with more than $10 billion in total assets and any affiliates thereof. The CFPB also has authority to define and prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices in the consumer financial area, and expanded data collecting powers for purposes of determining bank compliance with the fair lending laws. 

The CFPB has promulgated many mortgage-related final rules, including rules related to the ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requirements and appraisal and escrow standards for higher priced mortgages. In addition, several proposed revisions to mortgage-related rules are pending finalization. The mortgage-related final rules issued by the CFPB have materially restructured the origination, servicing and securitization of residential mortgages in the United States. These rules have impacted, and will continue to impact, the business practices of mortgage lenders, including the Company. For example, under the CFPB&#8217;s Ability to Repay and Qualified Mortgage rule, before making a mortgage loan, a lender must establish that a borrower has the ability to repay the mortgage. &#8220;Qualified mortgages&#8221;, as defined in the rule, are presumed to comply with this requirement and, as a result, present less litigation risk to lenders. For a loan to qualify as a qualified mortgage, the loan must satisfy certain limits on terms and conditions, pricing and a maximum debt-to-income ratio. Loans eligible for purchase, guarantee or insurance by a government agency or government-sponsored enterprise are exempt from some of these requirements. Satisfying the qualified mortgage standards, ensuring correct calculations are made for individual loans, recordkeeping and monitoring, as well as understanding the effect of the qualified mortgage standards on CRA obligations, impose significant new compliance obligations on, and involve compliance costs for, mortgage lenders, including the Company. 

Under the Durbin Amendment and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s implementing regulations, the Bank, as a debit card issuer, may receive a maximum permissible interchange fee equal to no more than $0.21 plus 5 bps of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions. Further, a debit card issuer may also recover $0.01 per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements required by the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve rules governing routing and exclusivity require debit card issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the bank&#8217;s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the institution, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. Furthermore, the relevant federal bank regulatory agency is required to consider a bank&#8217;s CRA assessment when considering the bank&#8217;s application to, among other things, merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of an insured depository institution or open or relocate a branch office. The relevant federal banking agency, the OCC in the Bank&#8217;s case, examines each bank and assigns it a public CRA rating. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of &#8220;outstanding,&#8221; &#8220;satisfactory,&#8221; &#8220;needs to improve,&#8221; or &#8220;unsatisfactory.&#8221; The Bank received an &#34;outstanding&#8221; rating at its most recent CRA evaluation. 

On May 20, 2020, the OCC adopted a final rule to amend the OCC&#8217;s regulations under the CRA. The final rule, which applies to national banks, like the Bank is designed to reflect changes in the banking industry while encouraging these institutions to meet the credit needs of local communities. The final rule makes significant and fundamental changes to many aspects of the OCC&#8217;s CRA regulations. Changes made by the OCC include: 

(1) clarifying the importance of the quantity and quality of activities;

##TABLE_START (2)

increasing credit for mortgage origination of affordable housing in low- and moderate-income areas; and

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)

clarifying credit for athletic facilities to ensure they benefit and support low- and moderate-income communities.

##TABLE_END

Importantly, the OCC&#8217;s final rule includes a general framework for assessing CRA performance, but does not set forth the specific metrics that a bank must meet in order to obtain a particular CRA rating. A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was issued in November 2020, requesting comment on the OCC&#8217;s proposed approach to determine the CRA evaluation measure benchmarks, retail lending distribution test thresholds and community development minimums under the general performance standards. The proposal further explains how the OCC would assess significant declines in CRA activities levels in connection with performance context following the initial establishment of benchmarks, thresholds and minimums. Following additional data collection and analysis, the OCC will set the benchmarks, minimums, and thresholds for the final rule. 

The OCC&#8217;s final rule is subject to a transition period for compliance, based on a bank&#8217;s size and business model. Banks such as the Bank will have until January 1, 2023 to comply with the new requirements. The FDIC and the Federal Reserve declined to join the final rule, and it is possible that each regulator will have its own CRA framework, leading to further changes in the Bank&#8217;s processes for CRA compliance. In the past, the federal banking agencies have aligned their CRA regulations. 

Anti-Money Laundering Rules 

The Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering (&#8220;AML&#8221;) program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports when appropriate. Among other things, these laws and regulations require the Bank to take steps to prevent the use of the Bank to facilitate the flow of illegal or illicit money, to report large currency transactions and to file suspicious activity reports. The Bank also is required to develop and implement a comprehensive AML compliance program. Banks must also have in place appropriate &#8220;know your customer&#8221; policies and procedures. 

The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, enacted on January 1, 2021 as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, does not directly impose new requirements on banks, but requires the U.S. Treasury Department to issue National Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Priorities, and conduct studies and issue regulations that may, over the next few years, significantly alter some of the due diligence, recordkeeping and reporting requirements that the Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act impose on banks. The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 also contains provisions that promote increased information-sharing and use of technology, and increases penalties for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and includes whistleblower incentives, both of which could increase the prospect of regulatory enforcement.

Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions, and the federal banking agencies are required to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution&#8217;s AML activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions. In addition to other bank regulatory agencies, the federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Department of the Treasury is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the state and federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, CFPB, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service. 

OFAC Regulation 

The Office of Foreign Assets Control or OFAC is responsible for administering economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others, as defined by various Executive Orders and in various legislation. OFAC-administered sanctions take many different forms. For example, sanctions may include: (1) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on U.S. persons engaging in financial transactions relating to, making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (2) a blocking of assets in which the government or &#8220;specially designated nationals&#8221; of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction, including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons. OFAC also publishes lists of persons, organizations and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. Blocked assets, for example property and bank deposits, cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. If we find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we must freeze or block such account or transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities. Failure to comply with these sanctions 

could have serious legal and reputational consequences. 

Data Privacy 

Federal and state law contains extensive consumer privacy protection provisions. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as amended, requires financial institutions to periodically disclose their privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. Other federal and state laws and regulations impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also requires financial institutions to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. These security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of personal and confidential information are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations. Federal law also makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means. 

Data privacy and data protection are areas of increasing state legislative focus. For example, in June of 2018, the Governor of California signed into law the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;). The CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, applies to for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds. The CCPA will give consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them, and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), the right to opt out of the sale of the consumer&#8217;s personal information, and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights. The CCPA contains several exemptions, including that many, but not all, requirements of the CCPA are inapplicable to information that is collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The California State Legislature has amended the Act since its passage, which the Governor has signed into law, and regulations reading CCPA went into effect on August 14, 2020. Modifications to the regulations are being considered and evaluated by California Attorney General and the California Department of Justice. California voters also recently passed the California Privacy Rights Act, which will take effect on January 1, 2023, and significantly modifies the CCPA, including by imposing additional obligations on covered companies and expanding California consumers&#8217; rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and additional costs and expenses. Because our correspondent division has an office in California, we are in the process of changing our data collection and retrieval processes to comply with the CCPA. In addition, similar laws may be adopted by other states where we do business. The federal government may also pass data privacy or data protection legislation. 

Like other lenders, the Bank uses credit bureau data in their underwriting activities. Use of such data is regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which also regulates reporting information to credit bureaus, prescreening individuals for credit offers, sharing of information between affiliates, and using affiliate data for marketing purposes. Similar state laws may impose additional requirements on us and our subsidiaries. 

Future Legislation and Regulation 

Banking statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. In addition to laws and regulations, state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to us and our subsidiaries. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation or the application of those laws or regulations, although enactment of any significant proposal could affect how we operate and could significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes or limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
