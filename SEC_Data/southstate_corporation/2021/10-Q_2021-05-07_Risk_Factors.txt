 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 

&#8203; 

Investing in shares of our common stock involves certain risks, including those identified and described in Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, as well as cautionary statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including those under the caption &#8220;Cautionary Note Regarding Any Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; set forth in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, risks and matters described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with the SEC.

&#8203; 

The Company is providing this additional risk factor to supplement the risk factors contained in Item 1A of our

Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.

&#8203; 

Changes to or the application of incorrect assumptions, estimates, or judgements in our financial statements could 

cause significant unexpected losses or impacts in the future 

&#8203; 

For example, the CECL standard, as of January 1, 2020, requires that we provide reserves for a current

estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for our loan portfolios and other financial assets, if applicable, at the time

those assets are acquired or originated. This estimate is adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit 

losses. Our allowance for credit losses estimate depends upon the CECL models and assumptions and forecasted 

&#160; 

macroeconomic conditions, including, among other things, the South Atlantic unemployment rate, and the credit indicators, composition, and other characteristics of our loan and other applicable portfolios. These model assumptions and forecasted macroeconomic conditions will change over time, whether due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors, resulting in greater variability in our ACL compared to its provision for loan losses under the previous GAAP methodology, and thus, will impact operations, as well as regulatory capital, including as the CECL phase-in begins as of January 1, 2022.
