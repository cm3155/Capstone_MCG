Unless otherwise mentioned or unless the context requires otherwise, references herein to &#8220;South State,&#8221; the &#8220;Company&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or similar references mean South State Corporation and its consolidated subsidiary. References to the &#8220;Bank&#8221; means South State Corporation&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, South State Bank, National Association, a national banking association. 

&#8203; 

Overview 

&#8203; 

South State Corporation is a bank holding company headquartered in Winter Haven, Florida, and was incorporated under the laws of South Carolina in 1985. We provide a wide range of banking services and products to our customers through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, South State Bank, National Association. a national banking association. The Bank also operates South State Advisory, Inc. (formerly First Southeast 401K Fiduciaries), a wholly owned registered investment advisor. Through the merger with CenterState Bank Corporation (&#8220;CSFL&#8221;) in the second quarter of 2020, the Bank also owns CBI Holding Company, LLC (&#8220;CBI&#8221;), which in turn owns Corporate Billing, LLC (&#8220;Corporate Billing&#8221;), a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers nationwide. Also, through the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020 , the holding company operates R4ALL, Inc., which manages troubled loans purchased from the Bank to their eventual disposition and CSFL Insurance Corp., a captive insurance subsidiary pursuant to Section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code. 

&#8203; 

At June 30, 2020, we had approximately $37.7 billion in assets and 5,368 full-time equivalent employees. Through the Bank, we provide our customers with checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings and time deposits of various types, brokerage services and alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds, trust and asset management services, business loans, agriculture loans, real estate loans, personal use loans, home improvement loans, manufactured housing loans, automobile loans, credit cards, letters of credit, home equity lines of credit, safe deposit boxes, bank money orders, wire transfer services, correspondent banking services, and use of ATM facilities.

&#8203; 

We have pursued, and continue to pursue, a growth strategy that focuses on organic growth, supplemented by acquisitions of select financial institutions, or branches in certain market areas.

&#8203; 

The following discussion describes our results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and also analyzes our financial condition as of June 30, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 . Like most financial institutions, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we may pay interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is the amount of our net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. 

&#8203; 

Of course, there are risks inherent in all loans, as such we maintain an allowance for credit losses, otherwise referred to herein as ACL, to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. We establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings. In the following discussion, we have included a detailed discussion of this process. 

&#8203; 

In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers. We incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings, the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits. We describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

The following sections also identify significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report. 

&#8203; 

Recent Events 

&#8203; 

COVID-19 

&#8203; 

The COVID-19 pandemic has severely restricted the level of economic activity in our markets. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of all of the states in which we have financial centers and of most other states have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes, and ordering temporary closures of some businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential. 

&#8203; 

While o ur business has been designated an essential business, which allows us to continue to serve our customers, we serve many customers that were deemed, or who were employed by businesses that were deemed, to be non-essential. Although many of the states in our market area have begun to allow businesses to reopen in the second quarter of 2020 that were deemed non-essential, there are still many restrictions and our customers are still being adversely effected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In many of the states in our market area, as the economies have been allowed to reopen, there has been an increase in cases of COVID-19 and some restrictions have been reinstated. 

&#8203; 

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve. The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impacts on trade (including supply chains and export levels), travel, employee productivity, unemployment, consumer spending, and other economic activities has resulted in less economic activity, lower equity market valuations and increased volatility and disruption in financial markets, and has had an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain and will depend on various developments and other factors, including, among others, the duration and scope of the pandemic, as well as governmental, regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic, and the associated impacts on the economy, financial markets and our customers, employees and vendors. 

&#8203; 

Our business, financial condition and results of operations generally rely upon the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, the value of collateral underlying our secured loans, and demand for loans and other products and services we offer, which are highly dependent on the business environment in our primary markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our business and operations. As part of our efforts to practice social distancing, in March 2020, we closed all of our banking lobbies and are conducting most of our business at this time through drive-thru tellers and through electronic and online means. To support the health and well-being of our employees, a majority of our workforce is working from home. To support our customers or to comply with law, we have deferred loan payments from 90 to 120 days for consumer and commercial customers, and we have suspended residential property foreclosure sales, evictions, and involuntary automobile repossessions, and are offering fee waivers, payment deferrals, and other expanded assistance for automobile, mortgage, small business and personal lending customers. Future governmental actions may require more of these and other types of customer-related responses. 

&#8203; 

As of July 24, 2020, we have deferrals of $2.7 billion, or 11.6%, of our total loan portfolio. For commercial loans, the standard deferral was 90 days for both principal and interest or 120 days of principal only. For consumer and mortgage loans, the standard deferral was 120 days of both principal and interest. We have actively reached out to our customers to provide guidance and direction on these deferrals. In terms of available lines of credit, the company has not experienced an increase in borrowers drawing down on their lines. Below are the loan portfolios which we view are of the greatest risk: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Lodging (hotel / motel) loan portfolio - 62% is under deferral, and the weighted average loan to value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) was 57%. The Company currently has $974 million, or 4.2% of the total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale and Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) loans, in lodging loans. &#8203; 

&#160; 

&#9679; Restaurant loan portfolio &#8211; 28% is under deferral, and the weighted average LTV of real estate secured was 55%. The Company currently has $505 million, or 2.2% of the total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale and PPP loans, in restaurants. &#8203; 

&#9679; Retail loan portfolio &#8211; 19% of retail CRE loan portfolio is under deferral and the weighted average LTV of 57%. The Company currently has $2.2 billion, or 9.6% of the total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale and PPP loans, in retail CRE loans. &#8203; 

Also, we have extended credit to both customers and non-customers related to the Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;). As of June 30, 2020, we have originated approximately 19,500 loans totaling approximately $2.4 billion through the PPP. 

&#8203; 

A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the CARES Act, the Company implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. The Company&#8217;s payment relief assistance includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to not apply TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8203; 

We are monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and financial condition. We implemented ASU 2016-13 in the first quarter of 2020 related to the calculation for our ACL for loans, investments, unfunded commitments and other financial assets. Considering the COVID-19 pandemic in our CECL models, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $151.5 million in the second quarter of 2020 which was significantly higher than previous quarters. Our provision for credit losses was comprised of three major components for period ended June 30, 2020: (1) $119.1 million for the day 1 provision for loans without significant credit deterioration (&#8220;Non-PCD&#8221;) acquired from CSFL, (2) $31.3 million from the legacy South State loan portfolio, and (3) $1.1 million from the acquired CSFL loan portfolio since the merger date. We also adjust our investment securities portfolio to market each period end and review for any impairment that would require a provision for credit losses. At this time, we have determined there is no need for a provision for credit losses related to our investment securities portfolio. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to recognize impairments in the future on the securities we hold, as well as reductions in other comprehensive income. We cannot currently determine the ultimate impact of the pandemic on the long-term value of our portfolio. 

&#8203; 

We also are monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on the valuation of goodwill. Additional detail in regards to the goodwill analysis is disclosed below under the Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets section of the Recent Events.

&#8203; 

CenterState Bank Corporation Merger 

&#8203; 

On June 7, 2020, South State Corporation acquired all of the outstanding common stock of CSFL, the bank holding company for CenterState Bank National Association (&#8220;CSB&#8221;), in a stock transaction. Pursuant to the merger agreement, (i) CSFL merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;), and (ii) immediately following the Merger, South State Bank (&#8220;SSB&#8221;), a South Carolina banking corporation and wholly owned bank subsidiary of the Company, merged with and into CSB, a national banking association and wholly owned bank subsidiary of CSFL, with CSB continuing as the surviving bank (the &#8220;Bank Merger&#8221;). In connection with the Bank Merger, CSB changed its name to &#8220;South State Bank, National Association&#8221; (hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). CSFL common shareholders received 0.3001 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock in exchange for each share of CSFL stock resulting in the Company issuing 37,271,069 shares of its common stock. In total, the purchase price for CSFL was $2.3 billion including the value of the conversion of outstanding stock options and restricted stock units totaling $15.4 million. 

&#8203; 

In the acquisition, the Company acquired $12.9 billion of loans (excluding loans held for sale) at fair value, net of $269.1 million, or 2.04%, estimated discount to the outstanding principal balance. Of the total loans acquired, management identified $3.1 billion with credit deficiencies that were identified as Purchased Credit Deteriorated (&#8220;PCD&#8221;) loans. The Company assumed $15.6 billion in deposits including a $20.2 million premium for fixed maturity time deposits. 

&#8203; 

As a result of the Bank Merger, the Bank is now a national banking association that is subject to primary

&#160; 

supervision and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#8220;OCC&#8221;) and subject to the National Bank Act and is no longer subject to supervision and regulation by the South Carolina Board of Financial Institutions. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is no longer the Bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator, and the Bank is now a member of the Federal Reserve System.

&#8203; 

Branch Consolidation 

&#8203; 

As a part of the ongoing evaluation of customer service delivery and efficiencies, on July 31, 2020, the Company announced the closing and consolidation of 19 branch locations in November of 2020. The expected cost associated with these closures and cost initiatives has been estimated to be approximately $5.8 million, and primarily includes personnel, facilities and equipment cost. The annual savings in 2021 of these closures is expected to be $6.6 million, and the impact on 2020 is anticipated to be approximately $825,000. Ten of the locations are in Florida, five in South Carolina, two in North Carolina, one in Georgia and one in Alabama. 

&#8203; 

Critical Accounting Policies 

&#8203; 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the banking industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by management&#8217;s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 2 and Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

&#8203; 

The following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.

&#8203; 

Allowance for Credit Losses or ACL 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects management&#8217;s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. Due to the Merger between the Company and CSFL effective June 7, 2020, management collectively evaluated loans utilizing two different methodologies for the second quarter. Management plans to consolidate two methodologies into one during the second half of 2020. Management uses the two systematic methodologies to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, management&#8217;s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion. The Company&#8217;s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects management&#8217;s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL. See also Note 7 &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, &#8220;Provision for Loan Losses and Nonperforming Assets&#8221; in this MD&#38;A.

&#8203; 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

&#8203; 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in a business combination. As of June 3 0, 2020, December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 , the balance of goodwill was $1.6 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset&#8217;s fair value. The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step test. The first step, used to identify potential impairment, involves comparing each reporting unit&#8217;s estimated fair value to its 

&#160; 

carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. 

&#8203; 

If required, the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step, over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit, and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted. 

&#8203; 

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment for all entities by requiring impairment charges to be based on the first step in today&#8217;s two-step impairment test under ASC Topic 350 and eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. This guidance was effective for the Company as of January 1, 2020. 

&#8203; 

We evaluated the carrying value of goodwill as of April 30, 2020, our annual test date, considering the effects of COVID-19 and determined that no impairment charge was necessary. Our stock price has historically traded above its book value and tangible book value. However, during the first quarter of 2020, our stock price fell below book value and has remained below book value during the second quarter of 2020. This drop in stock was in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic which has affected stock prices of companies in almost all industries. The lowest trading price for our stock during the first six months of 2020 was $40.42, and the stock price closed on June 30, 2020 at $47.66, which was below book value of $63.35 but above tangible book value of $38.33. The Company completed its annual valuation of the carrying value of goodwill as of April 30, 2020, taking into account the company&#8217;s drop in stock price in 2020, and taking into account the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have on the U.S. economy and the economies of the markets in which we operate. Along with its internal analysis, the Company received a limited independent third party valuation of its goodwill, and based upon the valuation and our analysis, we determined that no impairment charge was necessary at this time. We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the Company&#8217;s business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues and the economy continues to deteriorate, we will have to reevaluate the impact on our financial condition and impairment of goodwill. 

&#8203; 

Core deposit intangibles, client list intangibles, and noncompetition (&#8220;noncompete&#8221;) intangibles consist primarily of amortizing assets established during the acquisition of other banks. This includes whole bank acquisitions and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities from other financial institutions. Core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of long-term deposit relationships acquired in these transactions. Client list intangibles represent the value of long-term client relationships for the wealth and trust management business. Noncompete intangibles represent the value of key personnel relative to various competitive factors such as ability to compete, willingness or likelihood to compete, and feasibility based upon the competitive environment, and what the Bank could lose from competition. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives, such as deposit accounts in the case of core deposit intangible, on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from this intangible. The estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness. 

&#8203; 

Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets 

&#8203; 

Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of certain assets and liabilities, including available-for-sale securities, ACL, write downs of OREO properties, accumulated depreciation, net operating loss carry forwards, accretion income, deferred compensation, intangible assets, mortgage servicing rights, and post- retirement benefits. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that a deferred tax asset is not realizable. As 

&#160; 

changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Additionally, income tax returns are filed by the Company or its subsidiaries in the states of Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. We evaluate the need for income tax reserves related to uncertain income tax positions but had no material reserves at June 30, 2020 or 2019. 

&#8203; 

Other Real Estate Owned and Bank Property Held For Sale 

&#8203; 

Other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;) consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans. Prior to the merger with CSFL, we classified former branch sites as OREO. During the second quarter of 2020 and with the merger with CSFL, the Company elected to reclassify these assets as bank property held for sale and report on a separate line within the balance sheet. Both OREO and bank property held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and the fair value was determined on the basis of current valuations obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. At the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral, for OREO, any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the ACL. At the time a bank property is no longer in service and is moved to held for sale, any excess of the current book value over fair value is recorded as an expense in the statement of operations. Subsequent adjustments to this value are described below in the following paragraph. 

&#8203; 

We report subsequent declines in the fair value of OREO and bank properties held for sale below the new cost basis through valuation adjustments. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of these properties, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility. In response to market conditions and other economic factors, management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy. As a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from the current valuations used to determine the fair value of these properties. Management reviews the value of these properties periodically and adjusts the values as appropriate. Revenue and expenses from OREO operations as well as gains or losses on sales and any subsequent adjustments to the value are recorded as OREO expense and loan related expense, a component of non-interest expense. 

&#8203; 

Results of Operations 

&#8203; 

We reported consolidated net loss of ($84.9) million, or diluted loss per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) of ($1.96), for the second quarter of 2020 as compared to consolidated net income of $41.5 million, or diluted EPS of $1.17, in the comparable period of 2019, a 304.9% decrease in consolidated net income and a 267.5% decrease in diluted EPS. The $126.4 million decrease in consolidated net income was the net result of the following items: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; A $30.6 million increase in interest income, resulting from a $22.6 million increase in interest income from acquired loans and a $8.5 million increase in interest income on non-acquired loans. Non-acquired loan interest income increased due to the $2.0 billion increase in average balance, given the interest rate declined by 48 basis points, a direct impact of such loans. This increase in loan interest income was offset by a $3.0 million decline in interest income on federal funds sold, even though the average balance increased by $1.4 billion from the merger with CSFL and the funds that flowed in from the CARES Act; &#9679; A $4.8 million decrease in interest expense, resulting from a 42 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities even though the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $4.2 billion from the CARES Act and from the merger with CSFL. The decrease in cost of interest-bearing liabilities was due to a falling interest rate environment as the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate by 75 basis points from July 2019 to October 2019. The Federal Reserve then dropped the federal funds target rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The second quarter of 2020 reflects the full impact of these actions and the Company&#8217;s move to reduce the interest crediting rate on deposits; &#9679; A $147.8 million increase in the provision for credit losses, which resulted primarily from the provision for credit losses Non-PCD loans acquired from CSB (i.e., the impact of the adoption of CECL on Non-PCD acquired loans) and on non-acquired loans, which was the result of forecasted losses taking into consideration the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has on the overall economic environment and the impact on the overall loan portfolio; &#9679; A $16.7 million increase in noninterest income, which resulted primarily from a $13.1 million increase in mortgage banking income and a $9.2 million increase in correspondent banking and capital markets income. This increase was partially offset by declines in fees on deposit accounts of $2.7 million (as a result of the impact of the COVID- 

&#160; 

19 pandemic with less non-sufficient funds and bankcard fees), a decline in recoveries on acquired loans of $1.3 million (now part of ACL as a result of the CECL adoption) and no securities gains, which last year totaled $1.7 million. (See Noninterest Income section on page 86 for further discussion); &#9679; A $65.7 million increase in noninterest expense, which resulted primarily from a $38.2 million increase in merger-related expense and a $23.2 million increase in salaries and employee benefits primarily from the combined employee base from the merger with CSFL. (See Noninterest Expense section on page 87 for further discussion) ; and &#9679; A $35.0 million decrease in the provision for income taxes . This decrease was due to the pretax book loss recorded in the second quarter of 2020. The effective tax rate increased due to rate reducing items and additional federal tax credits available in the current quarter compared to the second quarter of 2019. &#8203; 

&#8203; 

Our asset quality related to loans continued to remain strong at the end of the second quarter of 2020. Total nonperforming assets (&#8220;NPAs&#8221;) increased by $77.5 million from March 31, 2020 to $142.0 million as of June 30, 2020 due to the addition of NPAs from the merger with CSFL on June 7, 2020. The year over year change totaled $107.4 million, and was the result of the merger with CSFL and the increase related to loans formerly accounted for as credit impaired loans (with ASU 2016-13 are now considered PCD loans), prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13. Acquired credit impaired loans were considered to be performing in prior periods, due to the application of the accretion method under FASB ASC Topic 310-30. The Company has not assumed or taken on any additional risk relative to these assets. NPAs as a percentage of total loans and repossessed assets remained flat at 56 basis points for the periods ended June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively, and increased from 0.31% as compared to June 30, 2019. This increase also was related to the addition of the non-accrual acquired credit impaired loans into NPAs due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13. Nonperforming assets have been reduced by former bank property held for sale. Prior to the merger, the 

Company included this information in nonperforming assets but is now reported as a separate item on the balance sheet.

All periods have been reclassified to reflect this change . NPAs increased $101.2 million from $40.8 million at December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily related to the merger with CSFL and the change due to ASU 2016-13 referenced above. Annualized net charge-offs for the second quarter of 2020 were 0.00%, or $101,000. 

&#8203; 

Non-acquired NPAs increased $7.6 million from $16.9 million at June 30, 2019 to $24.6 million at June 30, 2020, which resulted from a $7.3 million increase in non-acquired nonperforming loans. NPAs as a percentage of non- acquired loans and repossessed assets increased three basis points to 0.23% at June 30, 2020 as compared to 0.20% at June 30, 2019. Non-acquired NPAs increased $745,000 from $23.8 million at December 31, 2019. Acquired NPAs increased $99.7 million from $17.7 million at June 30, 2019 to $117.4 million at June 30, 2020 which was due primarily to the merger with CSFL and the adoption of ASU 2016-13 referenced above. 

&#8203; 

With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Company changed its method for calculating its allowance for loans from an incurred loss method to a life of loan method. See Note 2 &#8211; Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7 &#8211; Allowance for Credit Losses for further details. At June 30, 2020, the ACL was $434.6 million, or 1.70% of period end loans. Additionally, with the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the Company recorded separately a reserve for unfunded commitments of $21.1 million, or 0.08% of period end loans. For prior comparative periods, the ACL was $144.8 million, or 1.26%, of period-end loans and the allowance for loan losses on loans was $58.2 million, or 0.62%, at June 30, 2019. The ACL provides 3.53 times coverage of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2020. At December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, the allowance for loan losses on non-acquired loans provided coverage of 2.50 times and 3.43 times, respectively . We continued to show solid and stable asset quality numbers and ratios as of June 30, 2020. The increase in the ACL was the result of the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Initial provision for credit losses &#8211; CSFL Non-PCD loans $109.4 million (ASU 2016-13 requirement) &#9679; Provision for credit losses &#8211; normal quarterly increase $29.5 million reflective of modeled results &#9679; Net charge-offs, $101,000, or 0.00% annualized &#9679; Allowance for credit losses on PCD loans acquired from CSFL $150.9 million (part of fair value adjustment for these loans) &#8203; 

During the second quarter of 2020, acquired loan interest income increased $30.8 million compared to the first quarter of 2020. The yield on acquired loans was down to 5.08% at June 30, 2020 from 7.14% at March 31, 2020. The decrease in the yield in the second quarter of 2020 was primarily the result of the declining interest rate environment and the purchased loans in the CSFL merger. Loan accretion income recognized in the second quarter of 2020 totaled $10.1 million and included 23 days from the CSFL acquired loan portfolio. Accretion income decreased from $10.9 million in 

&#160; 

the first quarter of 2020. The higher accretion in the first quarter of 2020 was directly related to the adoption of CECL and elimination of loan pools, resulting in an acceleration of the recognition of the loan discount. Acquired period-end loan balances increased by $13.0 billion and acquired loans average balance increased by $3.3 billion, from March 31, 2020, due to the merger with CSFL. 

&#8203; 

The table below provides an analysis of the yield on our total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale, including both non-acquired and acquired loans. The acquired loan yield decreased from the second quarter of 2019 due to the PPP loans acquired in the CSFL merger and overall lower rate environment. Non-acquired loan yields were also lower due to the low yielding PPP loans originated during the second quarter of 2020.

(1) The accretion income on acquired loans includes the accretion from the discount on all acquired loans for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. In our previously filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, the accretion income on acquired loans included the accretion from the discount on the acquired non-credit impaired loan only. For the prior period, we reclassified the discount recognized related to acquired credit impaired loans to make the table comparable. This change was due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, which changed the accounting related to the acquired loan portfolio. &#8203; 

Compared to the balance at March 31, 2020, our non-acquired loan portfolio increased $1.0 billion, or 43.5% annualized, to $10.6 billion, driven primarily by the increase in commercial and industrial loans totaling $991.7 million due to the issuance of the PPP loans during the quarter. Commercial owner occupied loans real estate also increased by $24.6 million during the quarter. The acquired loan portfolio increased by $13.0 billion to $14.9 billion in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $1.9 billion at March 31, 2020, due to the merger with CSFL. Since June 30, 2019, the non-acquired loan portfolio has grown by $2.0 billion, or 22.9%, driven by increases in most loan categories. Commercial non-owner occupied real estate loans, commercial owner occupied real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and consumer non real estate loans have accounted for the largest increases contributing $424.1 million, or 16.3%, $284.4 million, or 17.9%, $1.2 billion, or 107.9%, and $61.2 million, or 12.2% of growth, respectively. Since June 30, 2019, the acquired loan portfolio increased by $12.3 billion, or 472.1% due to the merger with CSFL. 

&#8203; 

Compared to the first quarter of 2020, non-taxable equivalent net interest income increased $34.5 million or 27.0% due to the merger with CSFL. The increase in net interest income during the second quarter of 2020 was mainly due to the increase in interest income on loans of $33.5 million (non-acquired loans interest income increased $2.7 million and acquired loans interest income increased $30.8 million), an increase in interest income on loans held for sale of $1.2 million, partially offset by lower interest income from investment securities of $890,000. Interest expense declined $1.8 million during the quarter even though the average balances increased from the merger. Rates dropped on funding cost with the rate cuts in mid-March and were fully reflected in the second quarter of 2020. Interest expense from deposits declined by $1.8 million and from other borrowings by $522,000. The increase in interest income on non-acquired loans was due to an increase in the average balance of $1.0 billion which was the result of PPP loans during the second quarter of 2020. The effects from the increase in average balance on non-acquired loans was partially offset by the decline in yield of thirty basis points due to the falling interest rate environment as the Federal Reserve dropped the 

&#160; 

federal funds target rate by 75 basis points from July 2019 to October 2019 and then dropped the federal funds target rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in interest income from investment securities was due to a lower rate on a higher average balance of $284.7 million from the merger with CSFL. The declines in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings was due to the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drops in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve during 2019 and in March 2020. The positive effects on net interest income were partially offset by a decline in interest income on federal funds sold, reverse repurchase agreements and interest-earning deposits of $1.0 million. The decrease in interest income from federal funds sold, reverse repurchase agreements and interest-earning deposits was due to decline in yield of 99 basis points due the falling rate environment in full effect for the quarter but on a much higher average balance. The increase in interest income from loans held for sale was mostly due to an increase in the average balance $161.5 million, primarily from the merger with CSFL. The non-taxable equivalent net interest margin decreased during the second quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2020 by 44 basis points from 3.67% to 3.23%. The decrease in the net interest margin was mainly due to the decline in yield on interest-earning assets of 65 basis points offset by 25 basis point decline in the yield on interest-bearing liabilities. The cost of all categories of interest-bearing liabilities declined during the second quarter of 2020, except for corporate and subordinated debentures, which increased 8 basis points. This increase was from the debt assumed in the merger with CSFL. The increase in interest income on acquired loans was due to an increase in average balances due to the merger with CSFL in early June. The yield declined by 206 basis points due to the lower rate environment and the acquisition of PPP loans. 

&#8203; 

Compared to the second quarter of 2019, non-taxable equivalent net interest income increased $35.4 million, or 27.82%, and the non-taxable equivalent net interest margin decreased to 3.24% from 3.82%. For further discussion of the comparison of net interest income and net interest margin for the periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, see Net Interest Income and Margin section below on page 71. 

&#8203; 

Our quarterly efficiency ratio increased to 80.5% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 62.1% in the first quarter of 2020 and increased from 66.9% in the second quarter of 2019. The increase in the efficiency ratio compared to the first quarter of 2020 was the result of a $67.9 million, or 63.3% increase in noninterest expense partially offset by the effects of a $44.8 million, or 26.0% increase in net interest income and noninterest income. The increase in noninterest expense from the first quarter of 2020 was mainly due to a $36.2 million increase in merger-related costs, a $20.7 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, another 30% increase in most of the other expense line items from the merger with CSFL. The increase in net interest income and noninterest income was mainly due the merger with CSFL in early June. Mortgage banking income continues to benefit from low interest rate environment coupled with the business added from the merger with CSFL. 

&#8203; 

Diluted EPS and basic EPS was a loss of ($1.96), respectively, for the second quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of 2019 which were $1.17 and $1.18, respectively. The loss in the second quarter of 2020 was attributable to $119.1 million initial provision for credit losses recorded on Non-PCD loans and unfunded commitments acquired in the CSFL merger, and the merger-related costs incurred of $40.3 million, pre-tax. In addition, the weighted average common shares increased to 43.3 million shares, or 22.7%, due to the merger with CSFL compared to 35.3 million weighted average shares outstanding at June 30, 2019. The total number of shares outstanding at June 30, 2020 totaled 70,907,119, with 37.3 million issued in the merger with CSFL. The decrease in net income was mainly due the increase in the provision for credit losses of $147.8 million which resulted primarily from forecasted losses taking into consideration the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic, the initial provision for credit losses and the merger-related costs discussed above. The increase in outstanding shares from June 30, 2019 was due to the merger with CSFL.

* - Denotes a non-GAAP financial measure. The section titled &#8220;Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP&#8221; below provides a table that reconciles GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures.

** - For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, the calculation of this ratio was not meaningful due to the net loss during the periods. See explanation of the dividend payout ratio below for the comparative period calculations.

&#8203; 

&#9679; For the three months ended June 30, 2020, return on average tangible equity decreased to (19.71)% compared to 13.38% for the same period in 2019. This decrease was the result of a decline in net income to a net loss excluding amortization of intangibles of $81.3 million during the second quarter of 2020 along with the effects of an increase in average tangible equity of 25.6%. The net loss (merger expenses) and increase in average tangible equity (addition of equity from the merger) were both due to the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020. &#9679; For the three months ended June 30, 2020, return on average assets was a loss of (1.49)%, a decrease from 1.08% for the three months ended June 30, 2019. This decline was due to both a decrease in net income to a net loss of $84.9 million during the second quarter of 2020 and the effects of an increase of 48.5% in average assets. The net loss (merger expenses) and increase in average assets (addition of assets from the merger) were both due to the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020. &#9679; Equity to assets ratio was 11.91% for the three months ended June 30, 2020, a decrease from 15.14% for the three months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease from the comparable period in 2019 was due to the increase in total assets of 140.5% being greater than the increase of equity of 89.2% Both the increase in assets and equity were due to the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020. &#8203; 

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP 

&#8203; 

The return on average tangible equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the effect of the average balance of intangible assets and adds back the after-tax amortization of intangibles to GAAP basis net income. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information that is useful to investors in evaluating our performance and capital and may facilitate comparisons with other institutions in the banking industry as well as period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider South State&#8217;s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of South State. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, are not audited, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled financial measures used by other companies. Investors should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of South State&#8217;s results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.

Net Interest Income and Margin 

&#8203; 

Summary 

&#8203; 

Our taxable equivalent (&#8220;TE&#8221;) net interest margin for the second quarter of 2020 decreased by 58 basis points from 3.82% in the second quarter of 2019 to 3.24%. This decrease was due to a decrease in the yield of interest-earning assets of 90 basis points; partially offset by a decline in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 42 basis points. 

&#8203; 

Non-TE net interest margin also decreased by 58 basis points from the second quarter of 2019, for the same reason above. The decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets was due to decreases in the yield on federal funds sold, reverse repurchase agreements and interest-earning deposits of 219 basis point, decreases in the yield on investment securities of 59 basis point, decreases in yield on non-acquired loans of 48 basis points and decreases in yield on acquired loans of 146 basis points. The decrease in these yields was mostly due to the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drops in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve during 2019 and in March 2020. The overall yield on interest-earning assets also declined due to a change in the mix of interest-earning assets. The average balance on federal funds sold, reverse repurchase agreements and interest earning deposit and investments securities, the Company&#8217;s lowest yielding assets increased $2.1 billion partially from the merger with CSFL and from the decision to hold more liquidity during the current COVID-19 pandemic and recessionary economic pressures. The Company&#8217;s higher yielding assets, increased by $4.7 billion from the merger with CSFL in early June 2020. The effects from the decline in yield on interest-earning assets were partially offset by a decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities declined 42 basis points from 0.95% in the second quarter of 2019 to 0.53% in the second quarter of 2020. This decrease in cost on interest-bearing liabilities was due to decrease in all categories of interest-bearing deposits, a decrease in cost on federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements, a decrease in corporate and subordinated debentures, and a decrease in cost on other borrowings. The decreases were the result of the falling interest rate environment in the last half of 2019 and first quarter of 2020. The increase in other borrowings during 2019 was due to the Bank making the strategic decision to use longer term FHLB funding strategy to fund its balance sheet growth while the increase in borrowings in the first quarter of 2020 was to provide the Bank with additional liquidity in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Non-TE net interest income increased $35.4 million, or 27.8%, in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Some key highlights are outlined below: 

&#8203; 

1. Higher interest income of $30.6 million with acquired loan interest income increasing by $22.6 million because of higher average balances of acquired loans resulting from the merger with CSFL, higher non-acquired loan interest income of $8.5 million due to higher average balance of $2.0 billion and investment securities interest income increasing by $1.3 million because of higher average balances resulting from the merger with CSFL. The increases in interest income were partially offset by a $3.0 million decline in federal funds sold and repurchase agreements as the yield declined by 2.19%, even though the average balance increased by $1.4 billion. This increase was primarily from deposits from the CARES Act and PPP loans, along with securities sold by CSFL prior to the merger. 2. Lower interest expense of $4.8 million with interest-bearing deposit interest expense decreasing $4.8 million due to falling rate environment in the last half of 2019 and first quarter of 2020. Interest expense of other borrowings, corporate and subordinated debentures, and federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements, was flat comparing second quarter of 2020 to the same period one year ago. The average balance was higher by $673.1 million. 3. Non-TE yield on interest-earning assets for the second quarter of 2020 decreased 90 basis points from the comparable period in 2019. The decline in yield on interest-earning assets was due to the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drops in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve during 2019 and in March 2020 as well as a change in asset mix. 4. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the first quarter of 2020 decreased 42 basis points from the same period in 2019. This decrease occurred in all categories of funding and was due to the falling interest rate environment in the last half of 2019 and first quarter of 2020. 5. The Non-TE net interest margin decreased by 57 basis points and the TE net interest margin decreased by 58 basis points in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019 due to the decline in yield on the interest earning assets, which was only partially offset by lower yield on interest-bearing liabilities.

Total loans, net of deferred loan costs and fees (excluding mortgage loans held for sale), increased by $14.2 billion, or 127.1%, to $25.5 billion at June 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. Non-acquired loans or legacy loans increased by $2.0 billion, or 22.9%, from June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2020 through organic loan growth and PPP loans. Acquired loans increased by $12.3 billion, or 472.1% as compared to the same period in 2019. The overall increase in acquired loans was the addition of $13.1 billion due to the merger with CSB, net $801.7 million which were the result of principal payments, charge-offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans. Acquired loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 58.4% at June 30, 2020 compared to 23.2% at June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2020, non-acquired loans as a percentage of the overall portfolio were 41.4% compared to 76.8% at June 30, 2019.

Interest earned on loans increased $31.2 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019. Some key highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 are outlined below: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Our non-TE yield on total loans decreased 60 basis points in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 and average total loans increased $4.6 billion or 40.9%, in the second quarter of 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in average total loans was the result of 95.6% growth in the average acquired loan portfolio and 23.4% growth in the average non-acquired loan portfolio during the period. The growth in the acquired loan portfolio was due to the addition of $13.1 billion in loans from the merger with CSB, net of principal payments, charge-offs, and foreclosures. The growth in the non-acquired loan portfolio was due to normal organic growth and PPP loans. The yield on the acquired loan portfolio decreased from 6.54% in the second quarter of 2019 to 5.08% in the same period in 2020 and the yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio decreased from 4.32% in the second quarter of 2019 to 3.84% in the same period in 2020. The yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio decreased mainly due to the falling interest rate environment as the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate by 75 basis points from July 2019 to October 2019 and then dropped the federal funds target rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. This effectively decreased the Prime Rate, the rate used in pricing a majority of our new originated loans. The decrease in yield of 146 basis points on acquired loans was due to the lower interest rate environment that we have experienced over the past year and that continues currently, the increase in average loan balances of $2.6 million which were related to the merger with CSB, and loan accretion income on acquired loans totaling $10.1 million for the current quarter . The higher accretion income was due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, which eliminated loan pools and changed the accounting for acquired credit impaired loans. &#9679; The balance of mortgage loans held for sale increased $531.6 million from March 31, 2020 to $603.3 million at June 30, 2020, and increased $555.5 million from a balance of $47.8 million at June 30, 2019. 

&#8203; 

Investment Securities 

&#8203; 

We use investment securities, our second largest category of earning assets, to generate interest income through the deployment of excess funds, to provide liquidity, to fund loan demand or deposit liquidation, and to pledge as collateral for public funds deposits and repurchase agreements. At June 30, 2020, investment securities totaled $3.3 billion, compared to $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively . Our investment portfolio increased $1.3 billion from December 31, 2019 and $1.5 billion from June 30, 2019 mainly due to the acquisition of $1.2 billion in investment securities in the merger with CSFL. Excluding investment securities acquired in the CSFL merger, the investment securities portfolio increased by $72.1 million, or 7.2% from December 31, 2019 and by $310.8 million, or 17.6% from June 30, 2019. The increase in investment securities from December 31, 2019 was a result of investments acquired in the CSFL merger of $1.2 billion, purchases of $324.4 million as well as improvements in the market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio of $46.7 million. These increases were partially offset by maturities, calls and paydowns of investment securities totaling $294.8 million. N et amortization of premiums were $5.5 million in the first six months of 2020. We continue to try and increase our investment securities strategically with the excess funds from deposit growth and the increase in other borrowings in 2019 and the first half of 2020. The increase in fair value in the available for sale investment portfolio in the first half of 

&#160; 

2020 compared to December 31, 2019 was mainly due to the decrease in interest rates in March 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Interest earned on investment securities was higher in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. This is a result of the Bank carrying a higher average balance in investment securities in 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The average balance of investment securities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 increased $686.4 million and $596.7 million, respectively from the comparable periods in 2019. With the excess liquidity from the growth in deposits and other borrowings during 2019 and the first half of 2020, the Bank used the excess funds to strategically increase the size of its investment portfolio. The increase in the average balance was also due to the acquisition of CSFL&#8217;s investment portfolio of $1.2 billion in June 2020. The yield on the investment portfolio declined 59 basis points and 34 basis points, respectively, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 due to the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drop in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve during 2019 and in March 2020.

* Agency mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;) are guaranteed by the issuing government-sponsored enterprise (&#8220;GSE&#8221;) as to the timely payments of principal and interest. Except for Government National Mortgage Association securities, which have the full faith and credit backing of the United States Government, the GSE alone is responsible for making payments on this guaranty. While the rating agencies have not rated any of the MBS issued, senior debt securities issued by GSEs are rated consistently as &#8220;Triple-A.&#8221; Most market participants consider agency MBS as carrying an implied Aaa rating (S&#38;P rating of AA+) because of the guarantees of timely payments and selection criteria of mortgages backing the securities. We do not own any private label mortgage-backed securities. 

&#8203; 

At June 30, 2020, we had 192 securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $2.9 million. At December 31, 2019, we had 143 securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $4.5 million. At June 30, 2019, we had 98 securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $2.9 million. 

&#8203; 

As of June 30, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, the total number of available for sale securities with an unrealized loss position increased by 49 and 94 securities, respectively, while the total dollar amount of the unrealized loss decreased by $1.6 million and $38,000, respectively. The increase in the number of securities in an unrealized loss position is due the increase in total securities with the acquisition of CSFL&#8217;s investment portfolio. This decrease in the amount of the unrealized loss was mainly due to the drop in both short and long term interest rates during the last half of 2019 and the first half of 2020. In particular, the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.

&#8203; 

All debt securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2020 continue to perform as scheduled. We have evaluated the cash flows and determined that all contractual cash flows should be received; therefore impairment is temporary because we have the ability to hold these securities within the portfolio until the 

&#160; 

maturity or until the value recovers, and we believe that it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovery. We continue to monitor all of our securities with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that we will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of its securities may be sold or would require a charge to earnings as a provision for credit losses in such periods. Any charges as a provision for credit losses related to investment securities could impact cash flow, tangible capital or liquidity. See Note 2 &#8211; Summary of Significant Account Policies and Note 5 &#8211; Investment securities for further discussion on the application of ASU 2016-13 on the investment securities portfolio. 

&#8203; 

As securities held for investment are purchased, they are designated as held to maturity or available for sale based upon our intent, which incorporates liquidity needs, interest rate expectations, asset/liability management strategies, and capital requirements. Although securities classified as available for sale may be sold from time to time to meet liquidity or other needs, it is not our normal practice to trade this segment of the investment securities portfolio. While management generally holds these assets on a long-term basis or until maturity, any short-term investments or securities available for sale could be converted at an earlier point, depending partly on changes in interest rates and alternative investment opportunities.

&#8203; 

Other Investments 

&#8203; 

Other investment securities include primarily our investments in FHLB and FRB stock with no readily determinable market value. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. As of June 30, 2020, we determined that there was no impairment on its other investment securities. As of June 30, 2020, other investment securities represented approximately $133.4 million, or 0.35% of total assets and primarily consists of FHLB and FRB stock which totals $122.9 million, or 0.33% of total assets. There were no gains or losses on the sales of these securities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

&#8203; 

Trading Securities 

&#8203; 

CSFL had a correspondent banking department that was merged with the Company on June 7, 2020. This department occasionally purchases trading securities and subsequently sales them to correspondent bank customers to take advantage of market opportunities, when presented, for short-term revenue gains. Securities purchased for this portfolio have been primarily municipal securities and are held for short periods of time. This portfolio is carried at fair value and realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in trading securities revenue, a component of Correspondent Banking and Capital Market income in our Consolidated Statements of Income. At June 30, 2020, we had one municipal security carried as a trading security with a fair value of $494,000. 

&#8203; 

Interest-Bearing Liabilities 

&#8203; 

Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits, CDs, other time deposits, federal funds purchased, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include NOW, HSA, IOLTA, and Market Rate checking accounts.

The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $4.2 billion in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to increases in interest-bearing deposits of $3.5 billion and in other borrowings of $539.0 million. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits is due to the acquisition of $15.6 billion in deposits in the CSFL merger during the second quarter of 2020. The merger occurred on June 7 so the deposits were only outstanding for 23 days during the quarter. We continue to focus on increasing core deposits (excluding certificates of deposits and other time deposits), which increased $15.1 billion during the second quarter of 2020 consisting of $13.2 billion through the merger and $1.9 billion, organically. These funds are normally lower cost funds. The increase in average other borrowings was due to the Company executing a 90-day FHLB advance of $200.0 million in June 2019, with a cash 

&#160; 

flow hedge. The advance with this hedge is effectively locking in four and five years of fixed rate funding. This $200.0 million advance is five year funding at a rate of 1.89%. In March 2020, the Bank also executed another FHLB advance of $300.0 million at a rate of 0.47% for nine months and FRB borrowings of $200.0 million at a rate of 0.25% for three months. The borrowings executed in March 2020 were to provide additional liquidity in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. These additional borrowings were paid off in June 2020 as the Company did not need the excess liquidity. The Company also acquired $275.0 million in subordinated debt and trust preferred debt in the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020. This acquired debt was only outstanding for 23 days during the quarter. The decrease in interest expense of $4.8 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was driven by lower deposit interest expense of $4.8 million. The cost on interest-bearing deposits was 0.42% for the second quarter of 2020 compared to 0.81% for the same period in 2019. The decline in cost related to deposits was due the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drops in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve during 2019 and in March 2020. These changes resulted in a 42 basis point decrease in the average rate on all interest-bearing liabilities from 0.95% to 0.53% for the three months ended June 30, 2020. Some key highlights are outlined below: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Interest-bearing deposits increased $11.4 billion to $20.0 billion at June 30, 2020 from the period end balance at June 30, 2019 of $8.7 billion. The increase from June 30, 2019 was driven by an increase in money market accounts of $4.4 billion, interest-bearing transaction accounts of $3.4 billion, savings of $1.2 billion and in certificate of deposits of $2.4 billion. The increases, excluding deposits acquired in the CSFL merger, are money market accounts of $597.4 million, interest-bearing transaction accounts of $462.2 million and savings of $132.6 million. Certificate of deposits declined $131.7 million. We continue to monitor and adjust rates paid on deposit products as part of our strategy to manage our net interest margin. &#9679; Average transaction and money market account balances increased $2.6 billion, or 47.5% to $8.1 billion from the average balance in the second quarter of 2019. Interest expense on transaction and money market accounts decreased $4.5 million. The effects from the increase in average balance were partially offset by a 45 basis point decrease in the average cost of funds to 25 basis points for the three months June 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease in the cost of funds on the transaction and money market account is due to the falling interest rate environment. &#9679; Average savings account balances increased 25.4%, or $344.6 million to $1.7 billion from the average balance in the second quarter of 2019. Interest expense on savings accounts decreased $916,000. The effects from the increase in average balance were partially offset by a 29 basis point decrease in the average cost of funds to 8 basis points for the three months June 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease in the cost of funds on savings accounts is due to the falling interest rate environment. &#9679; Average balance on certificates of deposit and other time deposits increased 32.7%, or $571.9 million to $2.3 billion from the average balance in the second quarter of 2019. Interest expense on certificates of deposit and other time deposit accounts increased $683,000 as a result of the increase in average balance. The effects from the increase in average balance were partially offset by a 24 basis point decrease in the average cost of funds to 125 basis points for the three months June 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease in the cost of funds on certificates of deposit and other time deposit accounts is due to the falling interest rate environment. &#9679; In the second quarter of 2020, as discussed above, average other borrowings increased $539.0 million compared to the second quarter of 2019. The average rate on other borrowings experienced a 115 basis point decrease to 1.65% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 2.80% for the same period in 2019. The decrease in the average cost of other borrowings is due to the $200.0 million in FHLB advances added in June 2019 which have an average effective rate with the hedges of 1.89% and to the $500.0 million added in March 2020 which have an average effective rate of 0.38%. The $500.0 million in FHLB and FRB borrowings added in March 2020 were paid off in June 2020. These FHLB and FRB borrowings are at a lower cost than our remaining other borrowings which consist of long term trust preferred borrowings and the subordinated debt (acquired in the merger with CSFL). Long term trust preferred borrowings have variable rates and reprice quarterly and the subordinated debt currently has a fixed rate. For the second quarter of 2020, the average rate for our long term trust preferred debt and subordinated debt was 4.22% while the cost of our FHLB advances and FRB borrowings was 1.18%. The FHLB and FRB borrowings have driven down the average cost of our total borrowings. &#8203; 

Noninterest-Bearing Deposits 

&#8203; 

Noninterest-bearing deposits are transaction accounts that provide our Bank with &#8220;interest-free&#8221; sources of funds. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $2.4 billion, or 73.3%, to $5.6 billion in the second quarter of 

&#160; 

2020 compared to $3.2 billion during the same period in 2019. At June 30, 2020, the period end balance of noninterest-bearing deposits was $9.9 billion, exceeding the June 30, 2019 balance by $6.7 billion. This increase in both period end and average assets was due to the noninterest-bearing deposits of $5.3 billion acquired in the merger with CSFL in June 2020. The merger occurred on June 7 th so the noninterest bearing deposits were only outstanding for 23 days during the quarter which is reflected in the lower average balance. We continue to focus on increasing the noninterest-bearing deposits to try and limit our funding costs. Our overall cost of funds including noninterest-bearing deposits was 0.37% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 0.71% for the three months ended June 30, 2019. 

&#8203; 

Provision for Expected Credit Losses 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects management&#8217;s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. Management uses systematic methodologies to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, management&#8217;s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion. The Company&#8217;s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects management&#8217;s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses. The Company&#8217;s measurement of credit losses policy adheres to GAAP as well as interagency guidance. The Company&#39;s ACL is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans. 

&#8203; 

Due to the merger between South State and CSFL and each of its wholly owned bank subsidiaries, SSB and CSB effective June 7, 2020, management collectively evaluated loans under two different methodologies for the second quarter 2020. Management plans to consolidate these methodologies into one methodology during the second half of 2020.

&#8203; 

For the legacy SSB loans, the Company collectively evaluates loans that share similar risk characteristics. In general, Management has segmented loans by loan purpose. The Company collectively evaluates loans within the following 10 consumer and commercial segments: Consumer 1-4 Family Mortgage, Home Equity Line of Credit (&#8220;HELOC&#8221;), Consumer Non-Mobile Homes, Mobile Homes, Ready Reserve, Overdrafts, Land and Builder Finance Group Construction, Commercial Real Estate Owner-Occupied and Commercial Non-Real Estate, Commercial Income-Producing, and Business Express (&#8220;BEX&#8221;) and Microbusiness. The Consumer 1-4 Family Mortgage segment is further segmented by vintage year of origination or renewal. Although BEX and Microbusiness loans would typically be segmented within other commercial segments, Management has determined that BEX and Microbusiness loans share unique commercial risk characteristics such that there is a streamlined underwriting process more similar in nature to a consumer underwriting process. Legacy SSB Commercial loans that have a total credit exposure greater than $100,000 but less than $1.5 million are eligible for the expedited BEX process; Commercial loans of $100,000 or less, which are typically for equipment, fleet or other small business needs, are eligible for the expedited Microbusiness process. 

&#8203; 

For collectively evaluated legacy SSB loans, the Company in general uses four modeling approaches to estimate expected credit losses. The Company applies a vintage modeling methodology for the Consumer 1-4 Family Mortgage segment. The Company applies a statistical linear regression modeling methodology for the HELOC, Consumer Non-Mobile Homes, Land and Builder Finance Group Construction, Commercial Real Estate Owner-Occupied and Commercial Non-Real Estate, Commercial Income-Producing, and Ready Reserve segments. The Company applies a loss rate modeling methodology that includes one macroeconomic driver for the Mobile Homes and BEX and Microbusiness segments. Further, the Company applies an average loss rate modeling methodology for the Overdrafts segment. A prepayment assumption is inherently embedded in the vintage modeling methodology. For all other modeling approaches, the Company projects the contractual run-off of its portfolio at the segment level and incorporates a prepayment assumption in order to estimate exposure at default. 

&#8203; 

For legacy SSB loans, management has determined that the Company&#8217;s historical loss experience provides the best basis for its assessment of expected credit losses to determine the ACL. The Company utilized its own internal data to measure historical credit loss experience with similar risk characteristics within the legacy SSB loan segments over an economic cycle. Management reviewed the historical loss information to appropriately adjust for differences in current asset specific risk characteristics. Management also considered further adjustments to historical loss information for 

&#160; 

current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that differ from the conditions that existed for the period over which historical information was evaluated. For the majority of segment models for collectively evaluated loans, the Company incorporated at least one macroeconomic driver either using a statistical regression modeling methodology or simple loss rate modeling methodology. 

&#8203; 

For legacy SSB loans, management considers forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses. The Company subscribes to a third-party service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the United States economy. The baseline, along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios, is used by Management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The baseline forecast incorporates a 50% probability of the United States economy performing better than this projection and the same as the probability that it will perform worse. The baseline forecast was used for the two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. Management determined that the forecast period was consistent with how the Company has historically forecasted for its profitability planning. Management has evaluated the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast for the current period along with the inputs used in the estimation of expected credit losses. For the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to historical loss information within four quarters using a straight-line approach. Management may apply different reversion techniques depending on the economic environment for the financial asset portfolio and as of the current period has utilized a linear reversion technique. Management has evaluated the appropriateness of a reversion period for the current period and noted that it was reasonable. Management has excluded the legacy South State&#8217;s purchased failed financial institution&#8217;s transaction loss history in its reversion to the historical average loss rate. 

&#8203; 

Included in its systematic methodology to determine its ACL for legacy SSB loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures, Management considers the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. These qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation (i.e. formulaic model results). Each period the Company considers qualitative factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework that includes the following: 1) Concentration Risk, 2) Trends in Industry Conditions, 3) Trends in Portfolio Nature, Quality, and Composition, 4) Model Limitations, and 5) Other Qualitative Adjustments. For Concentration Risk, the Company incorporates qualitative adjustments to the formulaic model results for large loan concentrations, industry concentrations, geographic concentrations, and new market territories with limited or no loss history available. For Trends in Industry Conditions, the Company incorporates qualitative adjustments to the formulaic model result for drivers selected by our Credit Administration department that were not incorporated in the final statistical model or loss rate model. For Trends in Portfolio Nature, Quality, and Composition, the Company incorporates qualitative adjustments to the formulaic model results for underwriting exception trends, classified asset trends, delinquency trends, lending policies and procedures, and appraisal policies. For Model Limitations, the Company incorporates qualitative adjustments to the formulaic model results for predictive power, data limitations, and forecast risk. For Other Qualitative Adjustments, the Company incorporates qualitative adjustments to the formulaic model results for staff turnover rate/experience, staff coverage rate, changes in the training, legal or regulatory changes, natural disasters/weather events, political climate, and other &#8220;one-off&#8221; items. 

&#8203; 

For acquired CSFL loans, the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans with similar risk characteristics are grouped into homogenous segments, or pools, for analysis. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method is utilized for each loan in a pool, and the results are aggregated to the pool level. A periodic tendency to default and absolute loss given default are applied to a projective model of the loan&#8217;s cash flow while considering prepayment and principal curtailment effects. The analysis produces expected cash flows for each instrument in the pool by pairing loan-level term information (maturity date, payment amount, interest rate, etc.) with top-down pool assumptions (default rates, prepayment speeds). The company has identified the following portfolio segments: Commercial Real Estate, Multifamily, Hotel/Lodging, Municipal, Commercial and Industrial, Construction and Land Development, Residential Construction, Residential 1 st Mortgage, Residential 2 nd Mortgage, Home Equity Lines of Credit, and Consumer and Other.

&#8203; 

For acquired CSFL loans, Management has determined that the peer loss experience provides the best basis for its assessment of expected credit losses to determine the ACL. The Company utilized peer call report data to measure historical credit loss experience with similar risk characteristics within the acquired CSFL loan segments over an economic cycle. For the majority of segment models for collectively evaluated loans, the Company incorporated at least two macroeconomic drivers using a statistical regression modeling methodology. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Management considers forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses. For acquired CSFL loans, the Company subscribes to a third-party service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the United States economy. The baseline, along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios, is used by Management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The baseline forecast incorporates a 50% probability of the United States economy performing better than this projection and the same as the probability that it will perform worse. Management has evaluated the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and has made adjustments as needed. For the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straight-line approach. The Company generally utilizes a four quarter forecast and a four quarter reversion period for acquired CSFL loans. 

&#8203; 

Included in its systematic methodology to determine its ACL for acquired CSFL loans, Management considers the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. These qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation (i.e. formulaic model results). Each period the Company considers qualitative factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework that includes the following: 1) Lending Policy 2) Economic conditions not captured in models 3) Volume and Mix of Loan Portfolio 4) Past Due Trends 5) Concentration Risk 6) External Factors 7) Model Limitations. 

&#8203; 

When a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with its segment, the asset is assessed to determine whether it should be included in another pool or should be individually evaluated. Considering the size of the Company, management maintains a net book balance threshold of $1.0 million for individually-evaluated loans unless further analysis in the future suggests a change is needed to this threshold based on the credit environment at that time. Prior to the current quarter, the net book balance threshold was $250,000 for legacy SSB loans and $500,000 for acquired CSFL loans. Generally, individually-evaluated loans other than Troubled Debt Restructurings, otherwise referred to herein as &#8220;TDRs,&#8221; are on nonaccrual status. Based on the threshold above, consumer financial assets will generally remain in pools unless they meet the dollar threshold. The expected credit losses on individually-evaluated loans will be estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis unless the loan meets the criteria for use of the fair value of collateral, either by virtue of an expected foreclosure or through meeting the definition of collateral-dependent. Financial assets that have been individually evaluated can be returned to a pool for purposes of estimating the expected credit loss insofar as their credit profile improves and that the repayment terms were not considered to be unique to the asset. 

&#8203; 

Management measures expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan. When determining the contractual term, the Company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions, renewals, or modifications, unless the Company reasonably expects it will execute a TDR with a borrower. In the event of a reasonably-expected TDR, the Company factors the reasonably-expected TDR into the current expected credit losses estimate. The effects of a TDR are recorded when an individual asset is specifically identified as a reasonably-expected TDR. For legacy SSB consumer loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the borrower&#8217;s application for a modification (i.e. the borrower qualifies for the TDR) or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. For legacy SSB commercial loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the loan for modification or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. The Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the effect of the concession provided to the borrower in TDR within the ACL. There were no new TDRs added from the CSFL merger. 

&#8203; 

A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the CARES Act, the Company implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to not apply TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional detail in regards to the loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 is disclosed above under the COVID-19 section of the Recent Events. 

&#8203; 

For purchased credit-deteriorated, otherwise referred to herein as PCD, assets are defined as acquired individual financial assets (or acquired groups of financial assets with similar risk characteristics) that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Company&#8217;s assessment. The Company records acquired PCD loans by adding the expected credit losses (i.e. allowance for credit losses) to the purchase price of the financial assets rather than recording through the provision for credit losses in the income statement. The expected credit loss, as of the acquisition day, of a PCD loan is added to the allowance for 

&#160; 

credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is the difference between the unpaid principal balance and the amortized cost basis as of the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the change in the ACL on PCD loans is recognized through the provision for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is accreted or amortized, respectively, into interest income over the remaining life of the PCD loan on a level-yield basis. In accordance with the transition requirements within the standard, the Company&#8217;s acquired credit-impaired loans (i.e. ACI or Purchased Credit Impaired) were treated as PCD loans. Further, the legacy CSFL loans that were individually evaluated were identified as PCD loans. 

&#8203; 

The Company follows its nonaccrual policy by reversing contractual interest income in the income statement when the Company places a loan on nonaccrual status. Therefore, Management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on the portfolio and does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. As of June 30, 2020, the accrued interest receivable for loans recorded in Other Assets was $94.5 million. 

&#8203; 

The Company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an off-balance sheet exposure. These primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit. The expected losses associated with these exposures within the unfunded portion of the expected credit loss will be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet with an offsetting income statement expense. Management has determined that a majority of the Company&#8217;s off-balance-sheet credit exposures are not unconditionally cancellable. As of June 30, 2020, the liability recorded for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments in Other Liabilities was $21.1 million. The current adjustment to the ACL for unfunded commitments would be recognized through the provision for credit losses in the Statements of Income. 

&#8203; 

With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Company changed its method for calculating it allowance for loans from an incurred loss method to a life of loan method. See Note 2 &#8211; Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7 &#8211; Allowance for Credit Losses for further details. As of June 30, 2020, the balance of the ACL was $434.6 million or 1.70% of total loans. The ACL increased $289.8 million from the balance of $144.8 million recorded at March 31, 2020. This increase included a $139.0 million provision of credit losses during the second quarter of 2020 and an increase of $150.9 million through purchase accounting on CSFL&#8217;s PCD loans partially offset by $0.1 million in net charge-offs. For the six months ended June 30, 2020, the ACL increased $377.7 million from the balance of $56.9 million. This increase included a $173.7 million provision of credit losses during the period, a $150.9 million increase through purchase accounting on CSFL&#8217;s PCD loans and an increase of $54.5 million through the impact of the initial adoption of CECL. These increases were partially offset by $1.4 million in net charge-offs. The impact of COVID19 was modeled in the forecasted loss period and macroeconomic assumptions. 

&#8203; 

At June 30, 2020, the Company also had an ACL on unfunded commitments of $21.1 million which was recorded in Other Liabilities on the Balance Sheet, compared to $8.6 million at March 31, 2020. With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Company increased its allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments by $6.5 million in the first quarter of 2020. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, the provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments was $12.5 million and $14.3 million, respectively. Of these amounts, $9.6 million was related to the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020. These amounts were recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Statements of Income. The Company did not have an allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financials asset during the first and second quarter of 2020. 

&#8203; 

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, the allowance for non-acquired loan losses was $53.6 million, or 0.62%, of non-acquired period-end loans. With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the allowance was adjusted by $54.5 million. The ACL provides 3.53 times coverage of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2020. Net charge-offs to total loans during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were 0.00% and 0.02%, respectively. We continued to show solid and stable asset quality numbers and ratios as of June 30, 2020.

(1) Includes nonaccrual loans that are purchase credit deteriorated (PCD loans). In prior periods, these loans, which were called acquired credit impaired (&#8220;ACI&#8221;) loans were excluded from nonperforming assets. The adoption of CECL resulted in the discontinuation of the pool-level accounting for ACI loans and replaced it with loan-level evaluation for nonaccrual status. The Company&#8217;s nonperforming loans increased by $21.0 million in the first quarter of 2020 from these loans. The Company has not assumed or taken on any additional risk relative to these assets. (2) Periods prior to the adoption of CECL exclude the acquired credit impaired loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more totaling $9.2 million, $8.5 million, and $9.5 million as of December 31, 2019, September 30, 2019, and June 30, 2019, respectively, including the valuation discount. (3) Excludes certain real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure and property not intended for bank use. (4) Consists of non-real estate foreclosed assets, such as repossessed vehicles. (5) Loan data excludes mortgage loans held for sale. (6) For purposes of this calculation, total assets include all assets (both acquired and non-acquired). (7) Excludes non-acquired bank premises held for sale of $2.0 million, $2.7 million, $2.7 million, $2.3 million and $3.1 million as of June 30, 2020, March 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet. (8) Excludes acquired bank premises held for sale of $2.7 million as of June 30, 2020, March 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet. 

&#160; 

&#8203; 

Total nonperforming assets were $142.0 million, or 0.56% of total loans and repossessed assets, at June 30, 2020, an increase of $77.5 million, or 120.3%, from March 31, 2020, and an increase of $107.4 million, or 310.4%, from June 30, 2019. Total nonperforming loans were $123.3 million, or 0.48% of total loans, at June 30, 2020, an increase of $66.5 million, or 117.4%, from March 31, 2020, and an increase of $97.7 million, or 381.8%, from June 30, 2019. The increase in the nonperforming loan balances in the above schedule at June 30, 2020, compared to March 31, 2020, was due to the addition of $70.3 million in acquired nonperforming loans after the merger with CSB. Excluding the addition of these loans in the current period, acquired nonperforming loans declined by $2.7 million. Non-acquired nonperforming loans declined by $1.0 million from March 31, 2020. The increase in the nonperforming loan balances in the above schedule at June 30, 2020, compared to June 30, 2019, was due to the addition of the above mentioned loans related to the merger with CSB, as well as the addition of $21.0 million in the first quarter of 2020, formerly accounted for as credit impaired loans (with ASU 2016-13 are now considered PCD loans). Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, acquired credit impaired loans were considered to be performing, due to the application of the accretion method under FASB ASC Topic 310-30. The Company has not assumed or taken on any additional risk relative to these assets. There was an increase in non-acquired nonperforming loans of $7.3 million from June 30, 2019, which were primarily commercial loans.

At June 30, 2020, OREO totaled $18.0 million which included $1.2 million in non-acquired OREO and $16.8 million in acquired OREO. Total OREO increased $10.6 million from March 31, 2020, which was primarily due to the CSB acquisition. At June 30, 2020, non-acquired OREO consisted of 10 properties with an average value of $118,000. This compared to 7 properties with an average value of $112,000 at March 31, 2020. At June 30, 2020, acquired OREO consisted of 66 properties with an average value of $255,000. This compared to 53 properties with an average value of $125,000 at March 31, 2020. In the second quarter of 2020, we added two properties with an aggregate value of $477,000 into non-acquired OREO, and we sold no properties. We added a total of 22 properties, with 18 properties from the CSB acquisition, into acquired OREO, and we sold 9 properties with a basis of $1.3 million in the second quarter of 2020. 

&#8203; 

Potential Problem Loans 

&#8203; 

Potential problem loans (excluding all acquired loans) totaled $4.2 million, or 0.04% of total non-acquired loans outstanding, at June 30, 2020, compared to $8.9 million, or 0.09% of total non-acquired loans outstanding, at March 31, 2020, and compared to $8.2 million, or 0.09% of total non-acquired loans outstanding, at June 30, 2019. Potential problem loans related to acquired loans totaled $29.6 million, or 0.20% of total acquired loans outstanding, at June 30, 2020, compared to $7.0 million, or 0.36% of total acquired loans outstanding, at March 31, 2020. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, prior period acquired problem loans included only the non-credit impaired loans. At June 30, 2019, the acquired non-credit impaired potential problem loans were $7.1 million, or 0.32% of acquired non-credit impaired loans outstanding. All potential problem loans represent those loans where information about possible credit problems of the borrowers has caused management to have serious concern about the borrower&#8217;s ability to comply with present repayment terms. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Noninterest Income 

&#8203; 

Noninterest income provides us with additional revenues that are significant sources of income.

Noninterest income increased by $16.7 million, or 44.5%, during the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This quarterly change in total noninterest income primarily resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Service charges on deposit accounts were lower in the second quarter of 2020 by $2.7 million than the same quarter in 2019, due primarily to lower non-sufficient fund fees as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic resulting from funds provided by the CARES Act for customers leading to higher deposit balances and due to less spending and activity during the quarter. &#9679; Mortgage banking income increased by $13.1 million, or 246.2%, which was a result of higher income from the secondary market of $18.4 million due to higher activity and sales volume resulting from the decrease in interest rates and a higher margin, and from the addition of loan production from the CSFL. This increase was partially offset by the MSR, net of the hedge which declined by $5.4 million comparing second quarter of 2020 to the same quarter one year ago; &#9679; Correspondent banking and capital markets income increased by $9.2 million with $8.3 million of the increase being attributable to correspondent banking division of CSB acquired in the second quarter of 2020. Legacy capital markets income increased approximately $0.9 million due to a reduction in the CVA loss recorded in the current quarter; &#9679; Securities gains, net of $1.7 million during the second quarter of 2019 while there were no sales of securities in the second quarter of 2020, and therefore, no gains or losses; &#9679; There were no recoveries on acquired loans recorded in the income statement in the second quarter of 2020, due to the adoption of CECL at the beginning of 2020. Recoveries on acquired loans are no longer recorded through the income statement and are recorded through the ACL on the balance sheet. In the second quarter of 2019, there were $1.3 million in recoveries on acquired loans recorded through the income statement; and &#9679; Bank owned life insurance income is now separately reported (not included in other) in the table above and includes the income for 23 days related to the merger with CSFL, and results in slightly higher income than the one year ago quarter. &#8203; 

&#8203; 

Noninterest income increased by $28.8 million, or 41.3%, during the first six month of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This quarterly change in total noninterest income primarily resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Service charges on deposit accounts were lower in 2020 by $3.0 million compared to 2019, due primarily to lower non-sufficient fund fees as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic due to funds provided by the CARES Act for customers leading to higher deposit balances and due to less spending and activity during the quarter. &#9679; Mortgage banking income increased by $25.3 million, or 329.3%, which was a result of higher income from the secondary market of $25.0 million due to higher activity and sales volume resulting from the decrease in interest 

&#160; 

rates and a higher margin, and from the addition of loan production from the CSFL. Income from MSR, net of the hedge increased $327,000 comparing 2020 to 2019; &#9679; Correspondent banking and capital markets income increased by $9.7 million with $8.3 million of the increase being attributable to correspondent banking division of CSB acquired in the second quarter of 2020. Legacy capital markets income increased approximately $1.4 million due to an increase in fee income from swap transactions of $3.5 million offset by a higher CVA loss of $2.1 million; &#9679; Securities gains, net of $2.3 million during 2019 while there were no sales of securities in 2020, and therefore, no gains or losses; &#9679; There were no recoveries on acquired loans recorded in the income statement in 2020, due to the adoption of CECL at the beginning of 2020. Recoveries on acquired loans are no longer recorded through the income statement and are recorded through the ACL on the balance sheet. In 2019, there were $3.2 million in recoveries on acquired loans recorded through the income statement; and &#9679; Bank owned life insurance income is now separately reported (not included in other) in the table above. Income from BOLI increased $1.0 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to an increase in income from the payout of insurance policies $964,000. &#8203;

Noninterest expense increased by $65.7 million, or 60.1%, in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The quarterly increase in total noninterest expense primarily resulted from the following:

&#8203; 

&#9679; An increase in merger-related and branch consolidation related expense of $38.2 million compared to the second quarter of 2019. The costs in the second quarter of 2020 were related to the merger with CSFL while the costs in the second quarter of 2019 were related to branch consolidation and other cost saving initiatives; &#9679; Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by $23.2 million, or 39.6%, in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was mainly attributable to an increase in all categories of salaries and benefits due to the increase in employees through the merger with CSFL in June; and &#9679; The increases in the other line items, including occupancy expense, information services expense, amortization of intangibles, FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges and other noninterest expense, include 23 days of the expenses related to CSFL, and reflect approximately 30% increase in operating cost. &#8203; 

Noninterest expense increased by $74.7 million, or 36.0%, in the first six months of 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The categories and explanations for the increases year-to-date are similar to the ones noted above in the quarterly comparison. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Income Tax Expense 

&#8203; 

Our effective income tax rate was 22.56% and 25.20% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 19.78% and 20.00% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate was driven mainly by a pre-tax book loss that was generated during the current quarter. This along with the other rate reducing items also shown in the first quarter of the year, increased the income tax benefit that was recorded for the quarter. The pre-tax book loss is also what drove the increase in the effective tax rate compared to the year-to-date and second quarter 2019 effective tax rates, along with additional federal tax credits available in the current year compared to the same period in 2019.

&#8203; 

Capital Resources 

&#8203; 

Our ongoing capital requirements have been met primarily through retained earnings, less the payment of cash dividends. As of June 30, 2020, shareholders&#8217; equity was $4.5 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion, or 89.3%, from December 31, 2019, and an increase of $2.1 billion, or 89.2%, from $2.4 billion at June 30, 2019. The change from year-end was mainly attributable to the increase in equity through the issuance of common stock and the conversion of stock options and restricted stock totaling $2.3 billion from the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020. The following table shows the changes in shareholders&#8217; equity during 2020.

&#8203; 

On January 25, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a new program to repurchase up to 1,000,000 of our common stock, which were repurchased in the first and second quarter of 2019 at an average price of $69.89 per share (excluding commission expense) for a total of $69.9 million. In June 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 2,000,000 shares of our common stock after considering, among other things, our liquidity needs and capital resources as well as the estimated current value of our net assets (the &#8220;new Repurchase Program&#8221;). The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of the purchases during 2019 were based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of our common stock, and the availability of alternative investment opportunities. As of December 31, 2019, we had repurchased 1,165,000 shares at an average price of $74.72 a share (excluding sales commission) for a total of $87.1 million in common stock under the New Repurchase Program. During the first quarter of 2020, we remained active in repurchasing our common stock and bought 320,000 shares at an average price of $77.29 per share (excludes commission expense), a total of $24.7 million. No shares were repurchased during the second quarter of 2020. There were 515,000 shares available for repurchase remaining under the New Repurchase Program as of June 30, 2020. 

&#8203; 

We are subject to regulations with respect to certain risk-based capital ratios. These risk-based capital ratios measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks. The values of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are adjusted based on the rules to reflect categorical credit risk. In addition to the risk-based capital ratios, the regulatory agencies have also established a leverage ratio for assessing capital adequacy. The leverage ratio is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by total consolidated on-balance sheet assets (minus amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital). The leverage ratio does not involve assigning risk weights to assets. 

&#8203; 

As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, regulatory capital rules adopted in July 2013 and fully-phased in as of January 1, 2019, which we refer to as the Basel III rules or Basel III, 

&#160; 

impose minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The Basel III rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with more than $3 billion in total consolidated assets. 

&#8203; 

Specifically, we are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios:

&#8203; 

&#9679; a CET1, risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; 

&#9679; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; 

&#9679; a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and

&#9679; a leverage ratio of 4%.

&#8203; 

Under Basel III, Tier 1 capital includes two components: CET1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The highest form of capital, CET1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, otherwise referred to as AOCI, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, Tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities (as discussed below). Tier 2 capital generally includes the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying preferred stock, subordinated debt and qualifying tier 2 minority interests, less any deductions in Tier 2 instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock is included only in Tier 2 capital, except that the Basel III rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets to continue to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 Capital (but not in CET1 capital), subject to certain restrictions. With the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020, the Company&#8217;s $115.0 million in trust preferred securities no longer qualifies for tier 1 capital and is now only included in tier 2 capital for regulatory capital calculations. AOCI is presumptively included in CET1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. When implemented, Basel III provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI. We made this opt-out election and, as a result, retained our pre-existing treatment for AOCI. 

&#8203; 

In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, under Basel III, a banking organization must maintain a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three risk-based measurements (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The 2.5% capital conservation buffer was phased in incrementally over time, and became fully effective for us on January 1, 2019, resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%.

&#8203; 

On December 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the implementation of CECL&#894; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day 1 adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL&#894; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing. CECL became effective for us on January 1, 2020 and the Company applied the provisions of the standard using the modified retrospective method as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. Related to the implementation of ASU 2016-13, we recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of $54.4 million, deferred tax assets of $12.6 million, an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of $6.4 million and an adjustment to retained earnings of $44.8 million. Instead of recognizing the effects from ASU 2016-13 at adoption, the standard included a transitional method option for recognizing the day 1 effects on the Company&#8217;s regulatory capital calculations over a three-year phase-in. 

&#8203; 

In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of CECL. The interim final rule provides banking organizations that adopt CECL in the 2020 calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by the aforementioned three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of benefit during the initial two-year delay for a total five-year transition. The estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital (modified CECL transitional amount) is calculated as the sum of the day-one impact on retained earnings upon adoption of CECL (CECL transitional amount) and the calculated change in the ACL relative to the day-one ACL upon adoption of CECL multiplied by a scaling factor of 25%. The scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the ACL under CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology. The modified CECL 

&#160; 

transitional amount will be calculated each quarter for the first two years of the five-year transition. The amount of the modified CECL transition amount will be fixed as of December 31, 2021, and that amount will be subject to the three-year phase out. The Company chose the five-year transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from day 1 and the CECL difference for the first two years of application. 

&#8203; 

The Bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized) and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three risk-based regulatory capital ratios (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital) and for the leverage ratio.

&#8203;

The Tier 1 leverage ratio increased compared to December 31, 2019 due to the Company recording the full effect from the $2.3 billion addition to equity from the merger with CSFL while the increase in total assets of $19.0 billion from the merger were only included in the calculation of average assets since June 7, 2020. The CET1 risk-based capital and Tier 1 risk-based capital both decreased compared to December 31, 2019 due to the increase in our risk-based assets outpacing the increase in our tier 1 risk-based capital. This was mainly due to reductions in tier 1 risk-based capital due to the company no longer being able to include $115.0 in trust preferred debt as tier 1 capital based on the merger with CSFL along with the Company exceed $15.0 billion in assets, our repurchase of 320,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $24.7 million through our stock repurchase plans, a net loss during the year of $60.8 million, the common stock dividend paid of $31.6 million, and a reduction in retained earnings of $44.8 million from a cumulative change in accounting principle from the adoption of ASU 2016-13. The total risk-based capital ratio increased compared to December 31, 2019 due an increase in the allowance for credit losses that qualifies as tier 2 capital of $114.3 million and an increase in trust preferred debt and subordinated debt of $276.5 million that qualified for tier 2 capital. The increase in the allowance was mainly due a provision for credit losses of $119.1 million recorded on the loan portfolio and unfunded commitments acquired in the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020. The increase in debt that qualifies for tier 2 capital was due to the Company acquiring $238.0 million in subordinated debt and $38.5 million in trust preferred debt in the merger with CSFL. Our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory classification.

&#8203; 

Liquidity 

&#8203; 

Liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations, which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits, extension of credit and payment of operating expenses. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) is charged with monitoring liquidity management policies, which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. We have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs. 

&#8203; 

Asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans, investment securities and other short-term investments. Management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and 

&#160; 

investments. Normally, changes in the earning asset mix are of a longer-term nature and are not utilized for day-to-day corporate liquidity needs. 

&#8203; 

Our liabilities provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings. We engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our Bank; &#9679; Pricing deposits, including certificates of deposit, at rate levels that will attract and/or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our Bank&#8217;s asset/liability management and net interest margin requirements; and &#9679; Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our Bank&#8217;s appeal as a primary provider of financial services. &#8203; 

Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by approximately $1.3 billion, or approximately 29.2% annualized, compared to the balance at December 301 2019, and by $2.0 billion, or 22.9%, compared to the balance at June 30, 2019. Of the increase from both December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, $1.1 billion was related to PPP loans made in the first and second quarters of 2020. Excluding PPP loans, the non-acquired loan portfolio increased by $277.7 million, or 6.0% from December 31, 2019 and by $909.2 million, or 10.5% from June 30, 2019. The acquired loan portfolio increased by $12.8 billion from the balance at December 31, 2019 and by $12.3 billion from the balance at June 30, 2019. This increase was due the merger with CSFL in which the Company acquired $12.9 billion in loans in the second quarter of 2020. Excluding the acquired loans in the CSFL merger, the acquired loan portfolio decreased by $ 136.4 million, or 13.0% from December 31, 2019 and by $619.4 million, or 23.8% from June 30, 2019 through principal paydowns, charge-offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans.

Our investment securities portfolio increased $1.3 billion compared to the balance at December 31, 2019, and increased by $1.5 billion compared to the balance at June 30, 2019. Of these increases in investment securities, $1.2 billion was acquired in the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020. Excluding investment securities acquired in the CSFL merger, the investment portfolio increased by $72.1 million, or 7.2% from December 31, 2019 and by $310.8 million, or 17.6% from June 30, 2019. The increase in investment securities from December 31, 2019 was a result of investments acquired in the CSFL merger of $1.2 billion, purchases of $324.4 million as well as improvements in the market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio of $46.7 million. These increases were partially offset by maturities, calls and paydowns of investment securities totaling $294.8 million. N et amortization of premiums were $5.5 million in the first six months of 2020. The increase in investment securities excluding investments acquired in the CSFL merger was due to the Company making the strategic decision to increase the size of the portfolio with the excess funds from deposit growth and the increase in other borrowings. Total cash and cash equivalents were $4.4 billion at June 30, 2020 as compared to $688.7 million at December 31, 2019 and $852.0 million at June 30, 2019. The Company acquired $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents in the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020. Total deposits increased $2.0 billion (excluding the $15.6 billion in deposits acquired in the CSFL merger) in the first half of 2020 which improved liquidity. 

&#8203; 

At June 30, 2020, December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, we had $804.0 million, $0 and $3.9 million of traditional, out&#8211;of-market brokered deposits. We acquired $804.0 million in traditional, out-of-market brokered deposits in the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020. At June 30, 2020, December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, we had $524.9 million, $45.8 million, and $56.4 million, respectively, of reciprocal brokered deposits. Of the total reciprocal brokered deposits at June 30, 2020, $458.3 million were acquired in the CSFL merger. Total deposits were $30.0 billion at June 30, 2020, an increase of $17.8 billion from $12.2 billion at December 31, 2019 and an increase of $18.0 billion from $11.9 billion at June 30, 2019. This increase was due the merger with CSFL in which the Company acquired $15.6 billion in deposits in the second quarter of 2020. Excluding the acquired deposits in the CSFL merger, legacy deposits increased by $ 2.0 billion, or 33.6% (annualized) from December 31, 2019 and by $2.3 billion, or 19.2% from June 30, 2019. Our legacy deposit growth since December 31, 2019 included an increase in demand deposit accounts of $1.2 billion, an increase in savings and money market accounts of $545.3 million and an increase in interest-bearing transaction accounts of $297.9 million partially offset by a decline in certificates of deposit of $48.0 million. Other borrowings increased $273.3 million and $272.9 million, respectively, from December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 to $1.1 billion at June 30, 2020. Total short-term borrowings at June 30, 2020 were $720.5 million consisting of $362.3 million in federal funds purchased and $358.1 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Total other borrowings at June 30, 2020 were $1.1 billion consisting of $700.1 million in FHLB advances and $389.2 million in 

&#160; 

trust preferred and subordinated debt. Other borrowings increased approximately $273.3 million in the second quarter of 2020 through acquisition of trust preferred and subordinated debt in the CSFL merger. The Company borrowed $500 million in March 2019 and $200 million in June 2019 in 90-day fixed rate FHLB advances, which we currently plan to continuously renew. At the same time, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $350 million (a four year agreement) and $350 million (a five year agreement) to manage the interest rate risk related to these 90-day FHLB advances. We borrowed these FHLB advances to provide liquidity for operations, loan growth and investment growth. In March 2020, we executed another FHLB advance of $300.0 million at a rate of 0.47% for nine months and FRB borrowings of $200.0 million at a rate of 0.25% for three months. These borrowings executed in March 2020 were to provide additional liquidity in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. These borrowings were paid off in the second quarter of 2020 as the Company had excess liquidity. To the extent that we employ other types of non-deposit funding sources, typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers, we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds. Our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise.

&#8203; 

Our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position taking into account our current composition of earning assets, asset quality, capital position, and operating results. Our liquid earning assets include federal funds sold, balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, reverse repurchase agreements, and/or other short-term investments. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our Bank&#8217;s desired liquidity position at any time. We expect that these conditions would generally be of a short-term nature. Under such circumstances, our Bank&#8217;s federal funds sold position and any balances at the Federal Reserve Bank serve as the primary sources of immediate liquidity. At June 30, 2020, our Bank had total federal funds credit lines of $776.0 million with no balance outstanding. If additional liquidity were needed, the Bank would turn to short-term borrowings as an alternative immediate funding source and would consider other appropriate actions such as promotions to increase core deposits or the sale of a portion of our investment portfolio. At June 30, 2020, our Bank had $843.1 million of credit available at the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s Discount Window and had no balance outstanding. In addition, we could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks and/or the FHLB. At June 30, 2020, our Bank had a total FHLB credit facility of $3.2 billion with total outstanding FHLB letters of credit consuming $482 million and $700 million in outstanding advances leaving $2.1 billion in availability on the FHLB credit facility. The Company has a $100.0 million unsecured line of credit with U.S. Bank National Association with no outstanding advances. We believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available. 

&#8203; 

Our contingency funding plans incorporate several potential stages based on liquidity levels. Also, we review on at least an annual basis our liquidity position and our contingency funding plans with our principal banking regulator. We maintain various wholesale sources of funding. If our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful, we would utilize these alternative sources of funding. Under such circumstances, depending on the external source of funds, our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates we are charged. This could increase our cost of funds, impacting net interest margins and net interest spreads. 

&#8203; 

Deposit and Loan Concentrations 

&#8203; 

We have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers. We have no significant portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries. Furthermore, we attempt to avoid making loans that, in an aggregate amount, exceed 10% of total loans to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities. As of June 30, 2020, there were no aggregated loan concentrations of this type. We do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us. We do not have any foreign loans or deposits. 

&#8203; 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

&#8203; 

We consider concentrations of credit to exist when, pursuant to regulatory guidelines, the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents 25% of total Tier 1 capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments, or $725.8 million at June 30, 2020. Based on this criteria, we had six such credit concentrations at June 30, 2020, including loans on hotels and motels of $951.8 million, loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings (except mini-warehouses) of $3.2 billion, loans secured by owner occupied office buildings of $960.5 million, loans secured by owner occupied nonresidential buildings (excluding office buildings) of $2.0 billion, loans to lessors of residential buildings (investment properties and multi-family) of $1.1 billion and loans secured by 1 st 

&#160; 

mortgage 1-4 family owner occupied residential property of $3.9 billion. The risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time. The loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard ACL methodology. 

With the some financial institutions adopting CECL in the first quarter of 2020, banking regulators established new guidelines for calculating credit concentrations. Banking regulators set the guidelines for construction, land development and other land loans to total less than 100% of total Tier 1 capital plus the regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded commitment (CDL concentration ratio) and for total commercial real estate loans (construction, land development and other land loans along with other non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans) to total less than 300% of total Tier 1 capital plus the regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded commitments (CRE concentration ratio). Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank&#8217;s total Tier 1 capital plus the regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded commitment. At June 30, 2020, the Bank&#8217;s CDL concentration ratio was 62.3% and its CRE concentration ratio was 257.2%. As of June 30, 2020, the Bank was below the established regulatory guidelines. When a bank&#8217;s ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines, banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. Therefore, we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes. 

&#8203; 

Previous to the adoption of the new guidelines established in 2020, the guidelines for the construction, land development and other land loans were to total less than 100% of total risk-based capital and for total commercial real estate loans to total less than 300% of total risk-based capital. Both ratios were calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank&#8217;s total risk-based capital. At December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 the Bank&#8217;s construction, land development and other land loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 68.7% and 64.7%, respectively. Commercial real estate loans (which includes construction, land development and other land loans along with other non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans) as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 225.6% and 227.4% as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively.
