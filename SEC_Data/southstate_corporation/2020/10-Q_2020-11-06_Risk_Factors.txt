 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 

&#8203; 

Investing in shares of our common stock involves certain risks, including those identified and described in Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, as well as cautionary statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including those under the caption &#8220;Cautionary Note Regarding Any Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; set forth in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, risks and matters described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with the SEC.

&#8203; 

The Company is providing these additional risk factors to supplement the risk factors contained in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.

&#8203; 

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments and other factors that are highly uncertain and will be impacted by the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic. 

&#8203; 

The ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the international and United States economies and financial markets and has had an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The spread of COVID-19 has caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in business activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of the states in which we have financial centers and of most other states have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes, and ordering temporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential. These restrictions and other consequences of the pandemic have resulted in significant adverse effects for many different types of businesses, including, among others, those in the travel, hospitality and food and beverage industries, and have resulted in a significant number of layoffs and furloughs of employees nationwide and in the regions in which we operate. 

&#8203; 

The ultimate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the broader economy and the markets that we serve are not known, nor is the ultimate length of the restrictions described above and the extent of any accompanying effects. Moreover, the Federal Reserve has taken action to lower the Federal Funds rate, which may negatively affect our interest income and, therefore, earnings, financial condition and results of operation. Additional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business could be widespread and material, and may include, or exacerbate, among other consequences, the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; employees contracting COVID-19; &#9679; reductions in our operating effectiveness as our employees work from home; &#9679; work stoppages, forced quarantines, or other interruptions of our business; &#9679; unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities; &#9679; effects on key employees, including operational management personnel and those charged with preparing, monitoring and evaluating our financial reporting and internal controls; &#9679; sustained closures of our branch lobbies or the offices of our customers; &#9679; declines in demand for loans and other banking services and products; &#9679; reduced consumer spending due to both job losses and other effects attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic; &#9679; unprecedented volatility in United States financial markets; &#9679; volatile performance of our investment securities portfolio; 

&#160; 

&#9679; decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio, owing to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the markets we serve, leading to a need to increase our allowance for credit losses; &#9679; declines in value of collateral for loans, including real estate collateral; &#9679; declines in the net worth and liquidity of borrowers and loan guarantors, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us; and &#9679; declines in demand resulting from businesses being deemed to be &#8220;non-essential&#8221; by governments in the markets we serve, and from &#8220;non-essential&#8221; and &#8220;essential&#8221; businesses suffering adverse effects from reduced levels of economic activity in our markets. &#8203; 

These factors, together or in combination with other events or occurrences that may not yet be known or anticipated, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#8203; 

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in meaningfully lower stock prices for many companies, including our own, as well as the trading prices for many other securities. The further spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as ongoing or new governmental, regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic, may materially disrupt banking and other economic activity generally and in the areas in which we operate. This could result in further decline in demand for our banking products and services, and could negatively impact, among other things, our liquidity, regulatory capital, goodwill and our growth strategy. Any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#8203; 

We are taking precautions to protect the safety and well-being of our employees and customers. However, no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be adequate or deemed to be appropriate, nor can we predict the level of disruption which will occur to our employee&#8217;s ability to provide customer support and service. If we are unable to recover from a business disruption on a timely basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions, which could further adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a higher allowance for credit losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) determined in accordance with the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL standard, and may result in increased volatility and further increases in our allowance for loan losses. 

&#8203; 

The measure of our ACL is dependent on the adoption and interpretation of applicable accounting standards. The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new credit impairment model, the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL standard, which has become effective and was adopted by us in the first quarter of 2020. Under the CECL model, we are required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount and certain Management judgments over the life of the loan. This initial measurement took place as of January 1, 2020 at the time of our adoption of CECL, and measurements will occur periodically thereafter. The adoption of the CECL model has materially affected how we determine our ACL and, combined with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, required us to significantly increase our allowance. 

&#8203; 

The CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our ACL, as compared to the &#8220;incurred loss&#8221; standard that we previously applied in determining our ACL. The CECL model requires us to estimate the lifetime &#8220;expected credit loss&#8221; with respect to loans and other applicable financial assets, which may change more rapidly than the level of &#8220;incurred losses&#8221; that would have been used to determine our allowance for loan losses under the prior incurred loss standard. The potentially material effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on lifetime expected credit loss, and the challenges associated with estimating lifetime credit losses in view of the uncertain ultimate impacts of the pandemic, may result in increased volatility and significant additions to our ACL in the future, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

As a participating lender in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;), the Company and the Bank are subject to additional risks of litigation from the Bank&#8217;s customers or other parties regarding the Bank&#8217;s processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties. 

&#8203; 

The CARES Act included a $349 billion loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. On or about April 16, 2020, the SBA notified lenders that the $349 billion earmarked for the PPP was exhausted. Congress approved additional funding for the PPP of approximately $320 billion on April 24, 2020. This program has now expired. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. The Bank is participating as a lender in the PPP. The PPP opened on April 3, 2020&#894; however, because of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the opening of the PPP, there was some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, which exposes the Company to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. As of September 30, 2020, we have originated approximately 20,000 loans, totaling approximately $2.4 billion though the PPP program. Since the opening of the PPP, several other larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP. Two lawsuits were filed against the Company and the Bank, along with other larger and smaller banks, relating to the payment of agent fees in connection with the origination of PPP loans, but those lawsuits have been dismissed as against the Company and the Bank. The Company and the Bank may be exposed to the risk of additional litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached the Bank regarding PPP loans, regarding its process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. If any such litigation is filed against the Company or the Bank and is not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company or the Bank, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Company&#8217;s reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#8203; 

Paycheck Protection Program loans are fixed, low interest rate loans that are guaranteed by the SBA and subject

to numerous other regulatory requirements, and a borrower may apply to have all or a portion of the loan forgiven. If Paycheck Protection Program borrowers fail to qualify for loan forgiveness, the Bank faces a heightened risk of holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates for an extended period of time. While the Paycheck Protection Program loans are

guaranteed by the SBA, various regulatory requirements will apply to the Bank&#8217;s ability to seek recourse under the

guarantees, and related procedures are currently subject to uncertainty.

&#8203; 

The Bank also has credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Bank, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. Such deficiency also may be found in the event the Bank discovers any evidence of fraud relating to a PPP loan. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Company, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Company.
