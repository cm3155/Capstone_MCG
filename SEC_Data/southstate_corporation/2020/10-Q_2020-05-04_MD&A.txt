 Item 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

&#8203; 

This Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) relates to the financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report beginning on page 3. For further information, refer to the MD&#38;A appearing in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201 9 . Results for the three months ended March 31, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the year ending December 31, 2020 or any future period.

Unless otherwise mentioned or unless the context requires otherwise, references herein to &#8220;South State,&#8221; the &#8220;Company&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or similar references mean South State Corporation and its consolidated subsidiary. References to the &#8220;Bank&#8221; means South State Corporation&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, South State Bank, a South Carolina banking corporation. 

&#8203; 

Overview 

&#8203; 

South State Corporation is a bank holding company headquartered in Columbia, South Carolina, and was incorporated under the laws of South Carolina in 1985. We provide a wide range of banking services and products to our customers through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, South State Bank, a South Carolina-chartered commercial bank that opened for business in 1934. The Bank also operates South State Advisory, Inc. (formerly First Southeast 401K Fiduciaries), a wholly owned registered investment advisor. We merged Minis &#38; Co., Inc., another registered investment advisor that was wholly-owned by the Bank, with and into South State Advisory effective January 1, 2019. We do not engage in any significant operations other than the ownership of our banking subsidiary.

&#8203; 

At March 31, 2020, we had approximately $16.6 billion in assets and 2,583 full-time equivalent employees. Through the Bank, we provide our customers with checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings and time deposits of various types, brokerage services and alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds, trust and asset management services, business loans, agriculture loans, real estate loans, personal use loans, home improvement loans, manufactured housing loans, automobile loans, credit cards, letters of credit, home equity lines of credit, safe deposit boxes, bank money orders, wire transfer services, correspondent banking services, and use of ATM facilities.

&#8203; 

We have pursued, and continue to pursue, a growth strategy that focuses on organic growth, supplemented by acquisitions of select financial institutions, or branches in certain market areas.

&#8203; 

The following discussion describes our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 and also analyzes our financial condition as of March 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 . Like most financial institutions, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we may pay interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is the amount of our net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. 

&#8203; 

Of course, there are risks inherent in all loans, as such we maintain an allowance for credit losses, otherwise referred to herein as ACL, to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. We establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings. In the following discussion, we have included a detailed discussion of this process. 

&#8203; 

In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers. We incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings, the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits. We describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion. 

&#8203; 

The following sections also identify significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report. 

&#160; 

Recent Events 

&#8203; 

COVID-19 

&#8203; 

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in China, and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and the United States declared a National Public Health Emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely restricted the level of economic activity in our markets. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of the states in which we have financial centers and of most other states have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes, and ordering temporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential. 

&#8203; 

While o ur business has been designated an essential business, which allows us to continue to serve our customers, we serve many customers that have been deemed, or who are employed by businesses that have been deemed, to be non-essential. And many of our customers that have been categorized to date as essential businesses, or who are employed by businesses that have been categorized as essential businesses, have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8203; 

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve. The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impacts on trade (including supply chains and export levels), travel, employee productivity, unemployment, consumer spending, and other economic activities has resulted in less economic activity, lower equity market valuations and significant volatility and disruption in financial markets, and has had an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations is currently uncertain and will depend on various developments and other factors, including, among others, the duration and scope of the pandemic, as well as governmental, regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic, and the associated impacts on the economy, financial markets and our customers, employees and vendors. 

&#8203; 

Our business, financial condition and results of operations generally rely upon the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, the value of collateral underlying our secured loans, and demand for loans and other products and services we offer, which are highly dependent on the business environment in our primary markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole. The COVID-19 pandemic has begun to have a significant impact on our business and operations. As part of our efforts to exercise social distancing, in March 2020, we closed all of our banking lobbies and are conducting most of our business at this time through drive-thru tellers and through electronic and online means. To support the health and well-being of our employees, a majority of our workforce is working from home. To support our customers or to comply with law, we have deferred loan payments from 90 to 120 days for consumer and commercial customers, and we have suspended residential property foreclosure sales, evictions, and involuntary automobile repossessions, and are offering fee waivers, payment deferrals, and other expanded assistance for automobile, mortgage, small business and personal lending customers. Future governmental actions may require these and other types of customer-related responses. 

&#8203; 

As of March 31, 2020, we have deferrals of $1.7 billion of our total loan portfolio, which had increased to $2.4 billion as of April 30, 2020. For commercial loans, the standard deferral was 90 days for both principal and interest or 120 days of principal only. For consumer and mortgage loans, the standard deferral was 120 days of both principal and interest. We have actively reached out to our customers to provide guidance and direction on these deferrals. In terms of available lines of credit, the company has not experienced an increase in borrowers drawing down on their lines. Below are the loan portfolios which we view are of the greatest risk: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Lodging (hotel / motel) loan portfolio - we have experienced 100% deferrals, the average loan balance was $8.2 million and the weighted average loan to value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) was 57%. The Company currently has $590 million, or 5.1% of the total loan portfolio, in lodging loans. &#8203; 

&#9679; Restaurant loan portfolio &#8211; 59% is under deferral, with average loan balance of $692,000, and weighted average LTV of real estate secured was 66%. The Company currently has $225 million, or 2% of the total loan portfolio, in restaurants. &#8203; 

&#160; 

&#9679; Retail loan portfolio &#8211; 37% of retail CRE loan portfolio is under deferral, with an average loan balance of $888,000, and weighted average LTV of 59%. The Company currently has $558 million, or 4.8% of the total loan portfolio, in retail CRE loans. &#8203; 

Also, we have extended credit to both customers and non-customers related to the Payroll Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;). As of April 30, 2020, we have secured funding of approximately 9,300 loans totaling approximately $1.1 billion through the PPP. 

&#8203; 

We are monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and financial condition. We implemented ASU 2016-13 in the first quarter of 2020 related to the calculation for our ACL for loans, investments, unfunded commitments and other financial assets. Taking into consideration the COVID-19 pandemic into our CECL models, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $36.4 million in the first quarter of 2020 which was significantly higher than in previous quarters. Our provision for credit losses for periods ending after March 31, 2020 may be materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also adjust our investment securities portfolio to market each period end and review for any impairment that would require a provision for credit losses. At this time, we have determined there is no need for a provision for credit losses related to our investment securities portfolio. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to recognize impairments in the future on the securities we hold as well as reductions in other comprehensive income. We cannot currently determine the ultimate impact of the pandemic on the long-term value of our portfolio. 

&#8203; 

We also are monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on the valuation of goodwill. Our stock price has historically traded above its book value and tangible book value. However, during the first quarter of 2020, our stock price fell below book value. This drop in stock was in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic which has affected stock prices of companies in almost all industries. The lowest trading price for our stock during the first quarter of 2020 was $51.47, and the stock price closed on March 31, 2020 at $58.73, which was below book value of $69.40 but above tangible book value of $38.01. The Company updated its valuation of the carrying value of goodwill as of March 31, 2020 based on the drop in the Company&#8217;s stock price in the first quarter of 2020, and taking into account the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have on our local economy, we determined that no impairment charge was necessary at this time. We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the Company&#8217; business, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition. If the COVID-19 pandemic extends beyond a few more months and the economy continues to deteriorate, we will have to reevaluate the impact on our financial condition and impairment of goodwill. 

&#8203; 

CenterState Bank Corporation Proposed Merger 

&#8203; 

On January 25, 2020, South State and CenterState entered into the merger agreement, pursuant to which South State and CenterState have agreed to combine their respective companies in an all-stock merger of equals. The merger agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, CenterState will merge with and into South State, with South State continuing as the surviving entity, in a transaction we refer to as the &#8220;merger.&#8221; The merger agreement was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of South State and CenterState, and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. 

&#8203; 

Under the terms of the merger agreement, shareholders of CenterState will receive 0.3001 shares of South State common stock for each share of CenterState common stock they own. After the merger, it is anticipated that CenterState shareholders will own approximately 53% and South State shareholders will own approximately 47% of the combined company. The aggregate consideration, including &#8220;in the money&#8221; outstanding stock options, is valued at approximately $2.2 billion, based on approximately 124,132,401 shares of CenterState common stock outstanding as of April 29, 2020 and on South State&#8217;s April 30, 2020 closing stock price of $57.84. The transaction is expected to close by the third quarter of 2020. At March 31, 2020, CenterState reported $18.6 billion in total assets, $12.0 billion in loans and $14.1 billion in deposits. 

&#8203; 

Capital Management 

&#8203; 

During the first quarter of 2020, we remained active in repurchasing the company&#8217;s common stock and bought 320,000 shares at an average price of $77.29 per share (excludes commission expense), a total of $24.7 million. In June of 2019, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized a new Repurchase Program of 2,000,000 shares, and there were 515,000 shares available for repurchase under this plan as of March 31, 2020. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Critical Accounting Policies 

&#8203; 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the banking industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by management&#8217;s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

&#8203; 

The following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

Allowance for Credit Losses or ACL 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects management&#8217;s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. Management uses a systematic methodology to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, management&#8217;s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion. The Company&#8217;s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects management&#8217;s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL. See also Note 6 &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, &#8220;Provision for Loan Losses and Nonperforming Assets&#8221; in this MD&#38;A.

&#8203; 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

&#8203; 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in a business combination. As of March 3 1, 2020, December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 , the balance of goodwill was $1.0 billion for all periods. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset&#8217;s fair value. The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step test. The first step, used to identify potential impairment, involves comparing each reporting unit&#8217;s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. 

&#8203; 

If required, the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step, over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit, and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment for all entities by requiring impairment charges to be based on the first step in today&#8217;s two-step impairment test under ASC Topic 350 and eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. This guidance was effective for the Company as of January 1, 2020. 

&#8203; 

We previously had evaluated the carrying value of goodwill as of April 30, 2019, our annual test date, and determined that no impairment charge was necessary. Our stock price has historically traded above its book value and tangible book value. However, during the first quarter of 2020, our stock price fell below book value. This drop in stock was in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic which has affected stock prices of companies in almost all industries. The lowest trading price for our stock during the first quarter of 2020 was $51.47, and the stock price closed on March 31, 2020 at $58.73, which was below book value of $69.40 but above tangible book value of $38.01. The Company updated its valuation of the carrying value of goodwill as of March 31, 2020 based on the drop in the Company&#8217;s stock price in the first quarter of 2020 along with the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on our local economy and determined again that no impairment charge was necessary. We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the Company&#8217; business, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition. If the pandemic extends beyond a few more months and the economy continues to deteriorate, we will have to reevaluate the impact on our financial condition and impairment to goodwill. Should our future earnings and cash flows decline and/or the market value of our stock decreases further, an impairment charge to goodwill and other intangible assets may be required.

&#8203; 

Core deposit intangibles, client list intangibles, and noncompetition (&#8220;noncompete&#8221;) intangibles consist primarily of amortizing assets established during the acquisition of other banks. This includes whole bank acquisitions and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities from other financial institutions. Core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of long-term deposit relationships acquired in these transactions. Client list intangibles represent the value of long-term client relationships for the wealth and trust management business. Noncompete intangibles represent the value of key personnel relative to various competitive factors such as ability to compete, willingness or likelihood to compete, and feasibility based upon the competitive environment, and what the Bank could lose from competition. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives, such as deposit accounts in the case of core deposit intangible, on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from this intangible. The estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness. 

&#8203; 

Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets 

&#8203; 

Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of certain assets and liabilities, including available-for-sale securities, ACL, write downs of OREO properties, accumulated depreciation, net operating loss carry forwards, accretion income, deferred compensation, intangible assets, mortgage servicing rights, and post- retirement benefits. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that a deferred tax asset is not realizable. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Additionally, income tax returns are filed by the Company or its subsidiaries in the state of South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, Virginia, Alabama, and Mississippi. We evaluate the need for income tax reserves related to uncertain income tax positions but had no material reserves at March 31, 2020 or 2019. 

&#8203; 

Other Real Estate Owned 

&#8203; 

We report OREO, consisting of properties obtained through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans or through reclassification of former branch sites, at the lower of cost or fair value, determined on the basis of current valuations obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. At the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral, any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the ACL. Subsequent adjustments to this value are described below.

&#8203; 

&#160; 

We report subsequent declines in the fair value of OREO below the new cost basis through valuation adjustments. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of OREO, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility. In response to market conditions and other economic factors, management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy. As a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from the current valuations used to determine the fair value of OREO. Management reviews the value of OREO periodically and adjusts the values as appropriate. Revenue and expenses from OREO operations as well as gains or losses on sales and any subsequent adjustments to the value are recorded as OREO expense and loan related expense, a component of non-interest expense. 

&#8203; 

Results of Operations 

&#8203; 

We reported consolidated net income of $24.1 million, or diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) of $0.71, for the first quarter of 2020 as compared to consolidated net income of $44.4 million, or diluted EPS of $1.25, in the comparable period of 2019, a 45.7% decrease in consolidated net income and a 43.2% increase in diluted EPS. The $20.3 million decrease in consolidated net income was the net result of the following items: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; A $4.4 million increase in interest income, resulting from a $1.1 million increase in interest income from loans and a $3.2 million increase in interest income from investment securities. Non-acquired loan interest income increased $11.4 million due to a $1.3 billion increase in average balance on such loans. This increase in loan interest income was offset by a $10.3 million decline in interest income from the acquired loan portfolio due to a $931.5 million decline in the average loan balance on such loans. The increase in interest income from investment securities was due to an increase in average balance of $507.7 million; &#9679; A $336,000 decrease in interest expense, resulting from an 11 basis points decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities mostly offset by the effects from a $990.6 million increase in average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease in cost of interest-bearing liabilities was due to a falling interest rate environment as the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate by 75 basis points from July 2019 to October 2019. The Federal Reserve then dropped the federal funds target rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in average balances was due to a $585.7 million increase in other borrowings and a $360.9 million increase in interest-bearing deposits ; &#9679; A $35.0 million increase in the provision for credit losses which resulted primarily from forecasted losses taking into consideration the impact that COVID-19 pandemic will have on the loan portfolio; &#9679; A $12.1 million increase in noninterest income, which resulted primarily from a $12.3 million increase in mortgage banking income and a $1.8 million increase in other noninterest income. These increases were partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in recoveries on acquired loans (See Noninterest Income section on page 79 for further discussion); &#9679; A $9.0 million increase in noninterest expense, which resulted primarily from a $3.0 million increase in merger and branch consolidation related expense, a $2.5 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, and a $2.1 million increase in other noninterest (See Noninterest Expense section on page 79 for further discussion) ; and &#9679; A $7.0 million decrease in the provision for income taxes . This decrease was due to a lower effective tax rate which was driven by both lower pretax income and by additional federal and state tax credits available in the first quarter of 2020 compared to previous quarters. &#8203; 

Our asset quality related to loans continued to remain strong at the end of the first quarter of 2020. Total nonperforming assets (&#8220;NPAs&#8221;) increased by $27.5 million from March 31, 2019 to $69.9 million as of March 31, 2020 due to the addition of $21.0 million, formerly accounted for as credit impaired loans (with ASU 2016-13 are now considered PCD loans), prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13. Acquired credit impaired loans were considered to be performing in prior periods, due to the application of the accretion method under FASB ASC Topic 310-30. The Company has not assumed or taken on any additional risk relative to these assets. NPAs as a percentage of total loans and repossessed assets increased 23 basis points to 0.61% at March 31, 2020 as compared to 0.38% at March 31, 2019. This increase also was related to the addition of the non-accrual acquired credit impaired loans into NPAs due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 and accounted for 19 basis points of the increase in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019. NPAs increased $23.6 million from $46.2 million at December 31, 2019. Excluding the $21.0 million increase due the inclusion of acquired credit impaired non-accrual loans, NPAs increased $2.6 million compared to the balance at December 31, 2019. Annualized net charge-offs for the first quarter of 2020 were 0.05%, or $1.3 

&#160; 

million. Of the net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2020, $782,000 were related to charge-offs from overdrafts and ready reserve accounts. 

&#8203; 

Non-acquired NPAs increased $7.6 million from $20.0 million at March 31, 2019 to $27.6 million at March 31, 2020, which resulted from an $8.0 million increase in non-acquired nonperforming loans. NPAs as a percentage of non-acquired loans and repossessed assets increased five basis points to 0.29% at March 31, 2020 as compared to 0.24% at March 31, 2019. Non-acquired NPAs increased $1.0 million from $26.5 million at December 31, 2019. Acquired NPAs increased $20.0 million from $22.3 million at March 31, 2019 to $42.3 million at March 31, 2020 which was due to the inclusion of the non-accrual acquired credit impaired loans noted above. Excluding the $21.0 million increase due the inclusion of acquired credit impaired non-accrual loans, acquired NPAs decreased $1.0 million compared the balance at March 31, 2019 and increased $1.6 million from $19.7 million at December 31, 2019. 

&#8203; 

With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Company changed its method for calculating its allowance for loans from an incurred loss method to a life of loan method. See Note 2 &#8211; Significant Accounting Policies for further details. At March 31, 2020, the ACL was $144.8 million, or 1.26% of period end loans. Additionally, with the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the Company recorded separately a reserve for unfunded commitments of $8.6 million, or 0.07% of period end loans. For prior comparative periods, the allowance for non-acquired loan losses was $56.9 million, or 0.62%, of non-acquired period-end loans and $52.0 million, or 0.63%, at March 31, 2019. The ACL provides 2.55 times coverage of nonperforming loans at March 31, 2020. At December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the allowance for loan losses on non-acquired loans provided coverage of 2.50 times and 3.27 times, respectively . We continued to show solid and stable asset quality numbers and ratios as of March 31, 2020.

&#8203; 

During the first quarter of 2020, acquired loan interest income increased $587,000 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The yield on acquired loans was up to 7.14% at March 31, 2020 from 6.28% at December 31, 2019. The increase in the yield in the first quarter of 2020 was primarily the result of the increase in accretion income recognized in the first quarter of 2020. Accretion income increased from $7.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 to $10.9 million in the first quarter of 2020. The higher accretion was directly related to the adoption of CECL and elimination of loan pools, resulting in an acceleration of the recognition of the loan discount. The increase in income on acquired loans from the increase in yield was partially offset by the effects of the reduction in the balance of acquired loans. Acquired period-end loan balances decreased by $173.2 million and acquired loans average balance declined by $208.9 million, from December 31, 2019. This decrease was due to continued payoffs, charge-offs, transfers to OREO, and renewals of acquired loans moved to the non-acquired loan portfolio.

&#8203; 

The table below provides an analysis of the yield on our total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale, including both non-acquired and acquired loans. The acquired loan yield increased from the first quarter of 2019 due to increase in acquired loan accretion related to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, which eliminated loan pools and changed the accounting for credit impaired loans discussed above, together with acquired credit impaired loans being renewed 

&#160; 

and the cash flow from these assets being extended out, which increased the weighted average life of the loan pools within all acquired loan portfolios.

(1) The accretion income on acquired loans includes the accretion from the discount on all acquired loans for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. In our previously filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, the accretion income on acquired loans included the accretion from the discount on the acquired non-credit impaired loan only. For the prior period, we reclassed the discount recognized related to acquired credit impaired loans to make the table comparable. This change was due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, which changed the accounting related to the acquired loan portfolio. &#8203; 

Compared to the balance at December 31, 2019, our non-acquired loan portfolio has increased $310.1 million, or 13.5% annualized, to $9.6 billion, driven by increases in almost all categories: consumer real estate lending by $6.7 million, or 1.0% annualized; consumer non real estate lending by $18.5 million, or 13.9% annualized; commercial and industrial by $44.9 million, or 14.1% annualized; commercial owner occupied real estate by $65.8 million, or $14.8% annualized; and commercial non-owner occupied by $181.0 million, or 26.2% annualized. The acquired loan portfolio decreased by $178.3 million to $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2020 compared to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2019. This decrease was due to continued payoffs, charge-offs, transfers to OREO, and renewals of acquired loans moved to the non-acquired loan portfolio. Since March 31, 2019, the non-acquired loan portfolio has grown by $1.3 billion, or 15.1%, driven by increases in most loan categories. Consumer real estate loans, commercial non-owner occupied real estate loans, commercial owner occupied real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and consumer non real estate loans have accounted for the largest increases contributing $130.5 million, or 5.2%, $534.5 million, or 22.0%, $248.5 million, or 15.5%, $253.7 million, or 23.7%, and $91.9 million, or 19.8% of growth, respectively. Since March 31, 2019, the acquired loan portfolio decreased by $891.5 million, or 31.4% due to continued payoffs, charge-offs, transfers to OREO, and renewals of acquired loans moved to the non-acquired loan portfolio. 

&#8203; 

Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, non-taxable equivalent net interest income increased $1.6 million or 5.0% annualized. The increase in net interest income during the first quarter of 2020 was mainly due to the increase in interest income on loans of $752,000 (non-acquired loans interest income increased $165,000 and acquired loans interest income increased $587,000), an increase in interest income from investment securities of $812,000 and a decline in interest expense from deposits of $790,000 and from other borrowings of $446,000. The increase in interest income on non-acquired loans was due to an increase in the average balance of $351.1 million through organic loan growth. The effects from the increase in average balance on non-acquired loans was mostly offset by the decline in yield of nine basis points due to the falling interest rate environment as the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate by 75 basis points from July 2019 to October 2019 and then dropped the federal funds target rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in interest income on acquired loans was due to an increase in yield of 86 basis points due to higher accretion income of $3.5 million resulting from the adoption of CECL as discussed above. The increase in interest income from investment securities was due to an increase in the average balance of $133.4 million. The increase in the average balance of investment securities was due to the Company making the strategic decision to increase the size of the portfolio with the excess funds from deposit growth and the increase in other borrowings. The declines in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and other 

&#160; 

borrowings was due to the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drops in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve during 2019 and in March 2020. The positive effects on net interest income were partially offset by a decline in interest income on federal funds sold, reverse repurchase agreements and interest-earning deposits of $885,000 and on loans held for sale of $333,000. The decrease in interest income from federal funds sold, reverse repurchase agreements and interest-earning deposits was due to decline in yield of 54 basis points due the falling rate environment as well as a decrease in average balance of $35.6 million. The decrease in interest income from loans held for sale was mostly due to a decline in average balance $31.7 million. The non-taxable equivalent net interest margin increased during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 by four basis points from 3.63% to 3.67%. The increase in the net interest margin was mainly due to the decline in cost on interest-bearing liabilities of six basis points to 0.78% from 0.84% as well as the increase in yield on acquired loans of 86 basis points to 7.14%. The cost of all categories of interest-bearing liabilities declined during the first quarter of 2020 as interest-bearing deposits declined four basis points, federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements declined six basis points and other borrowings declined 37 basis points. These declines in cost were mainly due to the falling rate environment resulting from the drops in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve during 2019 and in March 2020. The increase in interest income on acquired loans was due to an increase in yield of 86 basis points due to higher accretion income of $3.5 million resulting from the adoption of CECL as discussed above. 

&#8203; 

Compared to the first quarter of 2019, non-taxable equivalent net interest income increased $4.7 million, or 15.5% annualized, and the non-taxable equivalent net interest margin decreased to 3.67% from 3.90%. For further discussion of the comparison of net interest income and net interest margin for the periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, see Net Interest Income and Margin section below on page 68. 

&#8203; 

Our quarterly efficiency ratio increased to 62.1% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 61.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and decreased from 63.2% in the first quarter of 2019. The increase in the efficiency ratio compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 was the result of a $6.6 million, or 6.6% increase in noninterest expense partially offset by the effects of a $9.4 million, or 5.8% increase in net interest income and noninterest income. The increase in noninterest expense from the fourth quarter of 2019 was mainly due to a $2.8 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $1.6 million increase in other noninterest expense and a $2.6 million decrease in merger and branch consolidation related expense. The increase in net interest income was mainly due to the decrease in interest expense of $1.2 million and the increase in noninterest income was mainly due to a $10.9 million increase in mortgage banking income. The main reason for the decrease in the efficiency ratio compared to the first quarter of 2019 was due to an increase in net interest margin and noninterest income of $16.8 million, or 10.8% partially offset by the effects of a $9.0 million, or 9.2% increase in noninterest expense. The increase in net interest income was mainly due to the increase in interest income of $4.4 million and the increase in noninterest income was mainly due to a $12.3 million increase in mortgage banking income. The increase in noninterest expense was mainly due to an increase in merger and branch consolidation expense of $3.0 million, an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $2.5 million, and an increase in other noninterest expense of $2.1 million. 

&#8203; 

Diluted EPS and basic EPS decreased to $0.71 and $0.72, respectively, for the first quarter of 2020, from the first quarter 2019 amounts of $1.25 and $1.25, respectively. This was the result of the 45.7% decrease in net income partially offset by a 5.4% decrease in outstanding common shares. The decrease in net income was mainly due the increase in the provision for credit losses of $35.0 million which resulted primarily from forecasted losses taking into consideration the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the loan portfolio in 2020 and beyond. The decrease in outstanding shares from March 31, 2019 was due to the Company repurchasing 1,985,000 common shares through its share repurchase programs.

&#8203; 

&#9679; For the three months ended March 31, 2020, return on average tangible equity decreased to 8.35% compared to 14.66% for the same period in 2019. This decrease was the result of a decrease in net income excluding amortization of intangibles of 43.2% partially offset by the effects of a slight decrease of 1.1% in average tangible equity. &#9679; For the three months ended March 31, 2020, return on average assets was 0.60%, a decrease from 1.21% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, due to a 45.7% decrease in net income partially offset by the effects of an 8.4% increase in average assets. &#9679; Dividend payout ratio was 65.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2020, and increase from 30.29% for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase from the comparable period in 2019 reflects the increase of 17.9% in cash dividends declared per common share as well as a 45.7% decrease in net income. The dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing total dividends paid during the quarter by the total net income reported for the same period. The dividend payout range for shareholders was adjusted to a range of 30% to 35% annually, from our historical range of 25% to 30% during the first quarter of 2019. &#9679; Equity to assets ratio was 13.95% for the three months ended March 31, 2020, a decrease from 15.42% for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease from the comparable period in 2019 was due to both an increase in assets of 8.0% and a 2.3% decrease in equity resulting from the Company repurchasing 1,985,000 common shares for $148.5 million since March 31, 2019. &#8203; 

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP 

&#8203; 

The return on average tangible equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the effect of the average balance of intangible assets and adds back the after-tax amortization of intangibles to GAAP basis net income. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information that is useful to investors in evaluating our performance and capital and may facilitate comparisons with other institutions in the banking industry as well as period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider South State&#8217;s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of South State. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, are not audited, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled financial measures used by other companies. Investors should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of South State&#8217;s results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.

Net Interest Income and Margin 

&#8203; 

Summary 

&#8203; 

Our taxable equivalent (&#8220;TE&#8221;) net interest margin for the first quarter of 2020 decreased by 24 basis points from 3.92% in the first quarter of 2019 to 3.68%. This decrease was due to a decrease in the yield of interest-earning assets of 31 basis points. 

&#8203; 

Non-TE net interest margin decreased by 23 basis points from the first quarter of 2019, which was mainly due to the yield on interest-earning assets decreasing by 21 basis points. The decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets was due to decreases in the yield on federal funds sold, reverse repurchase agreements and interest-earning deposits of 131 basis point and decreases in the yield on investment securities of five basis point and on non-acquired loans of 16 basis points. The decrease in these yields was mostly due to the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drops in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve during 2019 and in March 2020. The overall yield on interest-earning assets also declined due to a change in the mix of interest-earning assets. The average balance on federal funds sold, reverse repurchase agreements and interest earning deposit and investments securities, the Company&#8217;s lowest yielding assets, increased $797.3 million while the average balance on the acquired loan portfolio, the Company&#8217;s highest yielding asset, declined $931.5 million. The decreases in yield on interest-earning assets noted above was partially offset by an increase in the yield on acquired loans. The increase in yield of 80 basis points on acquired loans was due to higher accretion income of $1.3 million and due to acquired credit impaired loans being renewed and the cash flow from these assets being extended out, increasing the weighted average life of the loan pools within all acquired loan portfolios. The higher accretion income was due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, which eliminated loan pools and changed the accounting for acquired credit impaired loans. The effects from the decline in yield on interest-earning assets were partially offset by a decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities declined 11 basis points from 0.89% in the first quarter of 2019 to 0.78% in the first quarter of 2020. This decrease in cost on interest-bearing liabilities was due to decrease in cost on interest-bearing deposits of 14 basis points, a decrease in cost on federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements of 32 basis points and a decrease in cost on other borrowings of 151 basis points. The decrease in cost on interest-bearing deposits and federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements was due to the falling interest rate environment in the last half of 2019 and first quarter of 2020. The decrease in cost in other borrowings since March 31, 2019 was also due to the falling interest rate environment, but also related to the fact that the Company added $700 million in borrowings ($200 million FHLB borrowings in the second quarter of 2019, $300 million in FHLB borrowings in the first quarter of 2020 and $200 million in FRB borrowings in the first quarter of 2020) at a lower average cost than the borrowings held in the first quarter of 2019. The increase in other borrowings during 2019 was due to the Bank making the strategic decision to use longer term FHLB funding strategy to fund its balance sheet growth while the increase in borrowings in the first quarter of 2020 was to provide the Bank with additional liquidity in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Non-TE net interest income increased $4.7 million, or 3.9%, in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Some key highlights are outlined below: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Higher interest income of $4.4 million with non-acquired loan interest income increasing by $11.4 million because of higher average balances resulting from organic loan growth, investment securities interest income increasing by $3.2 million because of higher average balances resulting from the Bank having more funds to invest from the increases in total deposit and other borrowings. The increases in interest income were partially offset by a $10.3 million decline in acquired loan interest income due a decline in average balances of the acquired loan portfolio because of continued payoffs, charge-offs, transfers to OREO, and renewals of acquired loans moved to the non-acquired loan portfolio. &#9679; Lower interest expense of $336,000 with interest-bearing deposit interest expense decreasing $2.2 million due to a lower average cost of 14 basis points. This decline in yield was due to the falling rate environment in the last half of 2019 and first quarter of 2020. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest expense of other borrowings of $2.0 million, which was due to a higher average balances in other borrowings of $585.7 million. This increase in other borrowings during 2019 of $500 million was due to the Bank making the strategic decision to use longer term FHLB funding strategy to fund its balance sheet growth during while the increase in borrowings in the first quarter of 2020 of $500 million was to provide the Bank with additional liquidity in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. &#9679; Non-TE yield on interest-earning assets for the first quarter of 2020 decreased 21 basis points from the comparable period in 2019. The decline in yield on interest-earning assets was due to the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drops in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve during 2019 and in March 2020 as well as a change in asset mix. T he Bank&#8217;s change in asset mix occurred as the average balance on federal funds sold, reverse repurchase agreements and interest earning deposit and investments securities, the Bank&#8217;s lowest yielding assets, increased $797.3 million, while the average balance on the acquired loan portfolio, the Bank&#8217;s highest yielding asset, declined $931.5 million. &#9679; The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the first quarter of 2020 decreased 11 basis points from the same period in 2019. This decrease in cost on interest-bearing liabilities was due to decrease in cost on interest-bearing deposits of 14 basis points, a decrease in cost on federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements of 32 basis points and a decrease in cost on other borrowings of 151 basis points. The decrease in cost on interest-bearing deposits and federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements was due to the falling interest rate environment in the last half of 2019 and first quarter of 2020. The decrease in cost in other borrowings was also due to the falling interest rate environment, but also related to the fact that the Company added $700 million in borrowings ($200 million FHLB borrowings in the second quarter of 2019, $300 million in FHLB borrowings in the first quarter of 2020 and $200 million in FRB borrowings in the first quarter of 2020) since March 31, 2019 at a lower average cost than the borrowings held in the first quarter of 2019. &#9679; The Non-TE net interest margin decreased by 23 basis points and the TE net interest margin decreased by 24 basis points in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019 due mainly the decline in yield on the interest earning assets, the decline in the average balance of acquired loans of $931.5 million which is the Company&#8217;s highest yielding asset and the increases in the average balance of federal funds sold and reverse repurchase agreements and investment securities of $797.3 million which is the Bank&#8217;s lowest yielding assets. &#8203;

Total loans, net of deferred loan costs and fees (excluding mortgage loans held for sale), increased by $360.8 million, or 3.2%, to $11.5 billion at March 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. Non-acquired loans or legacy loans increased by $1.3 billion, or 15.1%, from March 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020 through organic loan growth. Acquired loans decreased by $891.5 million, or 31.4% as compared to the same period in 2019. The overall decrease in acquired loans was the result of principal payments, charge-offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans. Acquired loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to 16.9% at March 31, 2020 compared to 25.4% at March 31, 2019. As of March 31, 2020, non-acquired loans as a percentage of the overall portfolio were 83.1% compared to 74.6% at March 31, 2019.

Interest earned on loans increased $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019. Some key highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 are outlined below: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Our non-TE yield on total loans decreased seventeen basis points in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 and average total loans increased $416.7 million or 3.8%, in the first quarter of 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in average total loans was the result of 16.7% growth in the average non-acquired loan portfolio, offset by a 31.6% decline in the average acquired loan portfolio during period. The growth in the non-acquired loan portfolio was due to normal organic growth while the decline in the acquired loan portfolio was due to principal payments, charge-offs, and foreclosures. The yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio decreased from 4.30% in the first quarter of 2019 to 4.14% in the same period in 2020 and the yield on the acquired loan portfolio increased from 6.34% in the first quarter of 2019 to 7.14% in the 

&#160; 

same period in 2020. The yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio decreased mainly due to the falling interest rate environment as the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate by 75 basis points from July 2019 to October 2019 and then dropped the federal funds target rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. This effectively decreased the Prime Rate, the rate used in pricing a majority of our new originated loans. The increase in yield of 80 basis points on acquired loans was due to higher accretion income of $1.3 million and due to acquired credit impaired loans being renewed and the cash flow from these assets being extended out, increasing the weighted average life of the loan pools within all acquired loan portfolios. The higher accretion income was due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, which eliminated loan pools and changed the accounting for acquired credit impaired loans. Even with the yield on acquired loans increasing 80 basis points, the overall yield on the loan portfolio decreased 17 basis points. The effects from the increase in yield on the acquired loan portfolio was offset by the effects of average balance on acquired loans declining $931.5 million. Therefore, the decline in yield on non-acquired loan portfolio of 16 basis points along with the reduction in the average balance of the higher yielding acquired loan portfolio caused the overall yield on loans to decline. &#8203; 

The balance of mortgage loans held for sale increased $12.4 million from December 31, 2019 to $71.7 million at March 31, 2020, and increased $38.4 million from a balance of $33.3 million at March 31, 2019. 

&#8203; 

Investment Securities 

&#8203; 

We use investment securities, our second largest category of earning assets, to generate interest income through the deployment of excess funds, to provide liquidity, to fund loan demand or deposit liquidation, and to pledge as collateral for public funds deposits and repurchase agreements. At March 31, 2020, investment securities totaled $2.0 billion, compared to $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively . Our investment portfolio increased $29.0 million from December 31, 2019 and $527.3 million from March 31, 2019. The increase in investment securities from December 31, 2019 was a result of purchases of $104.0 million as well as improvements in the market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio of $40.5 million. These increases were partially offset by maturities, calls and paydowns of investment securities totaling $113.4 million. N et amortization of premiums were $2.7 million in the first three months of 2020. We continue to try and increase our investment securities strategically with the excess funds from deposit growth and the increase in other borrowings in 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. The increase in fair value in the available for sale investment portfolio in the first quarter of 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 was mainly due to the decrease in interest rates in March 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Interest earned on investment securities was higher in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019, as a result of the Bank carrying a higher average balance in investment securities in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The average balance of investment securities during the first quarter of 2020 increased $507.7 million from the first quarter of 2019. With the excess liquidity from the growth in deposits and other borrowings during 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, the Bank used the excess funds to strategically increase the size of its investment portfolio. The yield on the investment portfolio declined five basis points from the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2020 due to the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drops in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve during 2019 and in March 2020.

* Agency mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;) are guaranteed by the issuing government-sponsored enterprise (&#8220;GSE&#8221;) as to the timely payments of principal and interest. Except for Government National Mortgage Association securities, which have the full faith and credit backing of the United States Government, the GSE alone is responsible for making payments on this guaranty. While the rating agencies have not rated any of the MBS issued, senior debt securities issued by GSEs are rated consistently as &#8220;Triple-A.&#8221; Most market participants consider agency MBS as carrying an implied Aaa rating (S&#38;P rating of AA+) because of the guarantees of timely payments and selection criteria of mortgages backing the securities. We do not own any private label mortgage-backed securities. 

&#8203; 

At March 31, 2020, we had 62 securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $2.9 million. At December 31, 2019, we had 143 securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $4.5 million. At March 31, 2019, we had 269 securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $11.9 million. 

&#8203; 

As of March 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the total number of available for sale securities with an unrealized loss position decreased by 81 and 207 securities, respectively, while the total dollar amount of the unrealized loss decreased by $1.6 million and $9.0 million, respectively. This decrease in number and the amount of the unrealized loss was mainly due to the drop in both short and long term interest rates during the last half of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. In particular, the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.

&#8203; 

All debt securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2020 continue to perform as scheduled. We have evaluated the cash flows and determined that all contractual cash flows should be received; therefore impairment is temporary because we have the ability to hold these securities within the portfolio until the maturity or until the value recovers, and we believe that it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovery. We continue to monitor all of our securities with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that we will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of its securities may be sold or would require a charge to earnings as a provision for credit losses in such periods. Any charges as a provision for credit losses related to investment securities could impact cash flow, tangible capital or liquidity. See Note 2 &#8211; Summary of Significant Account Policies and Note 4 &#8211; Investment securities for further discussion on the application of ASU 2016-13 on the investment securities portfolio. 

&#8203; 

As securities are purchased, they are designated as held to maturity or available for sale based upon our intent, which incorporates liquidity needs, interest rate expectations, asset/liability management strategies, and capital requirements. We do not currently hold, nor have we ever held, any securities that are designated as trading securities. Although securities classified as available for sale may be sold from time to time to meet liquidity or other needs, it is not our normal practice to trade this segment of the investment securities portfolio. While management generally holds these assets on a long-term basis or until maturity, any short-term investments or securities available for sale could be converted at an earlier point, depending partly on changes in interest rates and alternative investment opportunities.

&#8203; 

Other Investments 

&#8203; 

Other investment securities include primarily our investments in FHLB stock with no readily determinable market value. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. As of March 31, 2020, we determined that there was no impairment on its other investment securities. As of March 31, 2020, other investment securities represented approximately $63.0 million, or 0.38% of total assets and primarily consists of FHLB stock which totals $56.9 million, or 0.34% of total assets. There were no gains or losses on the sales of these securities for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $990.6 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to increases in interest-bearing deposits of $360.9 million and in other borrowings of $585.7 million. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits is due to our continued focus on increasing core deposits (excluding certificates of deposits and other time deposits), which increased $491.5 million during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. These funds are normally lower cost funds. The increase in other borrowings was due to the Company executing two 90-day FHLB advances of $350.0 million and $150.0 million in March 2019 and another 90-day FHLB advance of $200.0 million in June 2019, each with a cash flow hedge. These advances with these hedges are effectively locking in four and five years of fixed rate funding. The $350.0 million advance is four year funding at a rate of 2.44%, the $150.0 million advance is five year funding at a rate of 2.21% and the $200.0 million advance is five year funding at a rate of 1.89%. In March 2020, the Bank executed another FHLB advance of $300.0 million at a rate of 0.47% for nine months and FRB borrowings of $200.0 million at a rate of 0.25% for three months. The borrowings executed in March 2020 were to provide additional liquidity in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in interest expense of $336,000 in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was driven by lower deposit interest expense of $2.2 million and was mostly offset by an increase in interest expense from other borrowings of $2.0 million. The cost on interest-bearing deposits was 0.65% for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 0.79% for the same period in 2019. The decline in cost related to deposits was due the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drops in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve during 2019 and in March 2020. The increase in interest expense related to other borrowing was from an increase in the average balance due to our strategic decision to use a longer term FHLB funding strategy to fund balance sheet growth. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in cost in other borrowings of 151 basis points due to the falling interest rate environment, but also related to the fact that the Company has added $700 million in borrowings since March 31, 2019 at a lower average cost than the borrowings held in the first quarter of 2019. O verall, all these factors resulted in an 11 basis point decrease in the average rate on all interest-bearing liabilities from 0.89% to 0.78% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Some key highlights are outlined below: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Average interest-bearing deposits for the three months ended March 31, 2020 increased 4.2% from the same period in 2019. &#9679; Interest-bearing deposits increased $278.0 million to $9.0 billion at March 31, 2020 from the period end balance at March 31, 2019 of $8.7 billion. The increase from March 31, 2019 was driven by an increase in money market accounts of $302.4 million and interest-bearing transaction accounts of $128.9 million partially offset by a decline in savings of $36.8 million and in certificate of deposits of $116.5 million. We continue to monitor and adjust rates paid on deposit products as part of our strategy to manage our net interest margin. &#9679; Average transaction and money market account balances increased $547.4 million, or 10.1% to $6.0 billion from the average balance in the first quarter of 2019. Interest expense on transaction and money market accounts decreased $1.7 million as a result of an 18 basis point decrease in the average cost of funds to 52 basis points for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease in the cost of funds on the transaction and money market account is due to the falling interest rate environment. &#9679; Average savings account balances decreased 4.1%, or $55.9 million to $1.3 billion from the average balance in the first quarter of 2019. Interest expense on savings accounts decreased $606,000 as a result of a 17 basis point decrease in the average rate to 20 basis points for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease in the cost of funds on savings accounts is due to the falling interest rate environment. 

&#160; 

&#9679; The average rate on certificates of deposit and other time deposits for the three months ended March 31, 2020 increased 11 basis points to 1.49% from the comparable period in 2019. Average balances on certificates of deposits and other time deposits for the three months ended March 31, 2020 decreased $130.6 million from the comparable period in 2019. The cost of funds on certificate of deposit has declined five basis points over the past two quarters as interest rates have declined, but is still higher than in the first quarter of 2019 as these type deposits take longer to reprice. &#9679; In the first quarter of 2020, average other borrowings increased $585.7 million compared to the first quarter of 2019. The average rate on other borrowings experienced a 151 basis point decrease to 2.15% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to 3.66% for the same period in 2019. The increase in average balance was the result of the Company executing $700.0 million in FHLB advances in 2019 to provide funding for growth in the investment and loan portfolios. The increase was also due to the addition of $500.0 million in borrowings in March 2020 to provide additional liquidity in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in the average cost of other borrowings is also due to the $700.0 million in FHLB advances added in 2019 which have an average effective rate with the hedges of 2.23% and $500.0 million added in March 2020 which have an average effective rate of 0.38%. These borrowings are at a lower cost than our remaining other borrowings which mainly consist of our long term trust preferred borrowings which reprice quarterly and are tied to three month LIBOR. For the first quarter of 2020, the average rate for our long term trust preferred borrowing was 4.16%. The new FHLB borrowings have driven down the average cost of our other borrowings. &#8203; 

Noninterest-Bearing Deposits 

&#8203; 

Noninterest-bearing deposits are transaction accounts that provide our Bank with &#8220;interest-free&#8221; sources of funds. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $209.4 million, or 6.8%, to $3.3 billion in the first quarter of 2020 compared to $3.1 billion during the same period in 2019. At March 31, 2020, the period end balance of noninterest-bearing deposits was $3.4 billion, exceeding the March 31, 2019 balance by $147.6 million. We continue to focus on increasing the noninterest-bearing deposits to try and limit our funding costs. Our overall cost of funds including noninterest-bearing deposits was 0.59% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to 0.67% for the three months ended March 31, 2019. 

&#8203; 

Provision for Expected Credit Losses 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects management&#8217;s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. Management uses a systematic methodology to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, management&#8217;s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion. The Company&#8217;s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects management&#8217;s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses. The Company&#8217;s measurement of credit losses policy adheres to GAAP as well as interagency guidance. The Company&#39;s ACL is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans. 

&#8203; 

For collectively evaluated loans, the Company in general uses four modeling approaches to estimate expected credit losses. A prepayment assumption is inherently embedded in the vintage modeling methodology. For all other modeling approaches, the Company projects the contractual run-off of its portfolio at the segment level and incorporates a prepayment assumption in order to estimate exposure at default. When a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with its segment, the asset is assessed to determine whether it should be included in another segment or should be individually evaluated. Financial assets that have been individually evaluated can be returned to a pool for purposes of estimating the expected credit loss insofar as their credit profile improves and that the repayment terms were not considered to be unique to the asset. 

&#8203; 

Management has determined that the Company&#8217;s historical loss experience provides the best basis for its assessment of expected credit losses to determine the ACL. The Company utilized its own internal data to measure historical credit loss experience with similar risk characteristics within the segments. For the majority of segment models for collectively evaluated loans, the Company incorporated at least one macroeconomic driver either using a statistical 

&#160; 

regression modeling methodology or simple loss rate modeling methodology. Management considers forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses. The Company subscribes to a third-party to provide a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the United States economy. The baseline, along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios, are used by Management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The baseline forecast was used for the two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. For the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to historical loss information within four quarters using a straight-line approach. 

&#8203; 

Included in its systematic methodology to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures, Management considers the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. These qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation (i.e. formulaic model results). Each period the Company considers qualitative factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework that includes the following: 1) Concentration Risk, 2) Trends in Industry Conditions, 3) Trends in Portfolio Nature, Quality, and Composition, 4) Model Limitations, and 5) Other Qualitative Adjustments. For further discussion of our Allowance for Credit Losses - See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

&#8203; 

With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Company changed its method for calculating it allowance for loans from an incurred loss method to a life of loan method. See Note 2 &#8211; Significant Accounting Policies for further details. As of March 31, 2020, the balance of the ACL was $144.8 million or 1.26% of total loans. The ACL increased $33.4 million from the balance of $111.4 million recorded at adoption of the CECL standard as of January 1, 2020. This increase included a $34.7 million provision of credit losses during the first quarter of 2020. This provision increase was a result of a $31.0 million increase from adjustments in qualitative measures, a $2.3 million increase from collectively evaluated loans, a $1.3 million increase from the impact of net charge offs during the quarter and a $0.1 million decline in the reserve for individually evaluated loans. The increase from qualitative measures was predominately driven by the impact of COVID-19. Forecasts considering the effects of COVID-19 caused a $20.3 million increase in concentration risk from loans with a balance greater than $15.0 million and a $7.3 million increase in model limitations from the impact of the COVID-19. The increase from the provision on collectively evaluated loans is a result of a 0.02% increase from the total loss rate that was used during adoption of CECL. Net charge offs during the first quarter of 2020 were $1.3 million. These net charge offs were primarily driven by the Overdraft/Ready Reserves, HELOCs and Mobile Home segments with net charge offs of $797,000, $211,000 and $326,000, respectively. 

&#8203; 

At March 31, 2020, the Company also had an ACL on unfunded commitments of $8.6 million which was recorded in Other Liabilities on the Balance Sheet. With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Company increased its allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments by $6.5 million. During the first quarter of 2020, the provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments was $1.8 million which was recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Statement of Operations. The Company did not have an allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financials asset during the first quarter of 2020. 

&#8203; 

For prior comparative periods, the allowance for non-acquired loan losses was $56.9 million, or 0.62%, of non-acquired period-end loans and $52.0 million, or 0.63%, at March 31, 2019. With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the allowance was adjusted by $54.5 million. The ACL provides 2.55 times coverage of nonperforming loans at March 31, 2020. At December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the allowance for loan losses on non-acquired loans provided coverage of 2.50 times and 3.27 times, respectively . Net charge-offs to total loans during the first quarter of 2020 were 0.05%. Net charge-offs from non-acquired loans were 0.06% and 0.02% for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and March 31,2019, respectively. On acquired loans only, net charge-offs were 0.04% during the first quarter of 2020. For the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2019, acquired loan net charge-offs were net recoveries of (0.01)% and net charge-offs of 0.03%, respectively. We continued to show solid and stable asset quality numbers and ratios as of March 31, 2020.

(1) Includes nonaccrual loans that are purchase credit deteriorated (PCD loans). In prior periods, these loans, which were called acquired credit impaired (&#8220;ACI&#8221;) loans were excluded from nonperforming assets. The adoption of CECL resulted in the discontinuation of the pool-level accounting for ACI loans and replaced it with loan-level evaluation for nonaccrual status. The Company&#8217;s nonperforming loans increased by $21.0 million in the first quarter of 2020 from these loans. The Company has not assumed or taken on any additional risk relative to these assets. (2) Prior periods exclude the acquired credit impaired loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more totaling $9.2 million, $8.5 million, $9.5 million, and $15.9 million as of December 31, 2019, September 2019, June 30, 2019, and March 31, 2019, respectively, including the valuation discount. (3) Includes certain real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure and property not intended for bank use. (4) Consists of non-real estate foreclosed assets, such as repossessed vehicles. (5) Loan data excludes mortgage loans held for sale. (6) For purposes of this calculation, total assets include all assets (both acquired and non-acquired). &#8203; 

Nonperforming assets were $69.9 million, or 0.49% of total loans, at March 31, 2020, an increase of $23.6 million, or 51.1%, from December 31, 2019 and an increase of $27.5 million, or 65.1%, from March 31, 2019. The increase in the nonperforming loan balance in the above schedule at March 31, 2020, compared to these prior periods, is due to the addition of $21.0 million, formerly accounted for as credit impaired loans (with ASU 2016-13 are now considered PCD loans), prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13. Acquired credit impaired loans were considered to be performing in prior periods, due to the application of the accretion method under FASB ASC Topic 310-30. The Company has not assumed or taken on any additional risk relative to these assets. Excluding the addition of these loans 

&#160; 

in the current period, nonperforming assets increased $2.6 million and $6.5 million, respectively, from December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019. 

&#8203; 

Nonperforming non-acquired loans, including restructured loans, were $23.9 million, or 0.25% of non-acquired loans, at March 31, 2020, an increase of $8.0 million, or 50.3%, from March 31, 2019. The increase in nonperforming loans was driven primarily by an increase in commercial nonaccrual loans of $6.1 million and an increase in restructured loans of $3.2 million, offset by a decline in consumer nonaccrual loans of $934,000 and a decline in past due 90 day loans still accruing of $377,000. Nonperforming non-acquired loans, including restructured loans, increased by $1.1 million during the first quarter of 2020 from the level at December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in restructured nonaccrual loans of $1.4 million and consumer nonaccrual loans of $384,000, offset by a decline in commercial nonaccrual loans of $335,000 and past due 90 day loans still accruing of $395,000. Non-acquired nonperforming loans still remain at historically low levels at March 31, 2020. 

&#8203; 

Nonperforming acquired loans, including restructured loans, were $32.8 million, or 1.69% of acquired loans, at March 31, 2020, an increase of $18.2 million, or 125.3%, from March 31, 2019. Nonperforming acquired loans increased by $21.7 million during the first quarter of 2020, or 195.0%, from December 31, 2019. These increase were primarily due to the application of ASU-2016-13 as discussed above.

&#8203; 

At March 31, 2020, OREO totaled $12.8 million which included $3.5 million in non-acquired OREO and $9.3 million in acquired OREO. Total OREO increased $880,000 from December 31, 2019. At March 31, 2020, non-acquired OREO consisted of 17 properties with an average value of $205,000. This compared to 17 properties with an average value of $210,000 at December 31, 2019. At March 31, 2020, acquired OREO consisted of 55 properties with an average value of $170,000. This compared to 42 properties with an average value of $200,000 at December 31, 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, we added one property with an aggregate value of $8,000 into non-acquired OREO, and we sold one property with a basis of $99,000. We added 19 properties with an aggregate value of $2.0 million into acquired OREO, and we sold 6 properties with a basis of $958,000 in the first quarter of 2020. 

&#8203; 

Potential Problem Loans 

&#8203; 

Potential problem loans (excluding all acquired loans) totaled $8.9 million, or 0.09% of total non-acquired loans outstanding, at March 31, 2020, compared to $7.5 million, or 0.08% of total non-acquired loans outstanding, at December 31, 2019, and compared to $8.0 million, or 0.10% of total non-acquired loans outstanding, at March 31, 2019. Potential problem loans related to acquired loans totaled $7.0 million, or 0.36% of total acquired loans outstanding, at March 31, 2020. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, prior period acquired problem loans included only the non-credit impaired loans. At December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the acquired non-credit impaired potential problem loans were $4.4 million, or 0.25% of acquired non-credit impaired loans outstanding and $4.2 million, or 0.18% of acquired non-credit impaired loans outstanding, respectively. All potential problem loans represent those loans where information about possible credit problems of the borrowers has caused management to have serious concern about the borrower&#8217;s ability to comply with present repayment terms. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Noninterest Income 

&#8203; 

Noninterest income provides us with additional revenues that are significant sources of income. At March 31, 2020 and 2019, noninterest income comprised 25.6%, and 20.6%, respectively, of total net interest income and noninterest income.

&#8203; 

Noninterest income increased by $12.1 million, or 37.7%, during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This quarterly change in total noninterest income primarily resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Mortgage banking income increased by $12.3 million, or 514.1%, which was a result of higher income from the secondary market of $6.6 million due to higher activity and sales volume resulting from the decrease in interest rates and a higher margin. The gain on sale of mortgage loans increased by $3.9 million and income from the change in fair value in the mortgage pipeline and loans held for sale increased by $3.4 million. Income from mortgage servicing rights, net of the hedge increased $5.7 million mainly as a result of the gains on hedge significantly outpacing the decline in fair value of the MSR resulting from the decline in interest rates; &#9679; Securities gains, net of $541,000 during the first quarter of 2019 while there were no sales of securities in the first quarter of 2020 and therefore, no gains or losses; &#9679; There were no recoveries on acquired loans recorded in the income statement in the first quarter of 2020. Due to the adoption of CECL and beginning in 2020, recoveries on acquired loans are no longer recorded through the income statement and will be recorded through the ACL on the balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2019, there were $1.9 million in recoveries on acquired loans recorded through the income statement; and &#9679; Other noninterest income increased $1.8 million, or 80.8% during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was mainly due to $1.2 million in income received from proceeds from the payout on a life insurance policy in the first quarter of 2020. Also, income from our capital markets group increased $509,000 on an increase in swap fees of $2.3 million offset by a decline in the credit valuation adjustment on our swaps of $1.9 million. &#8203;

&#160; 

Noninterest expense increased by $9.0 million, or 9.2%, in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The quarterly increase in total noninterest expense primarily resulted from the following:

&#8203; 

&#9679; An increase in merger and branch consolidation related expense of $3.0 million compared to the first quarter of 2019. The costs in the first quarter of 2020 were related to the pending merger with CenterState while the costs in the first quarter of 2019 were related to branch consolidation as we closed 13 branches during 2019; &#9679; Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by $2.5 million, or 4.4%, in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was mainly attributable to an increase in employee salaries and wages of $2.0 million and severance pay and related expense of $594,000; &#9679; Other noninterest expense increased by $2.1 million, or 26.8%, in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was mainly attributable to an increase in passive losses on tax credit partnerships of $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2020. Investments in tax credit partnerships have increased $37.6 million, or 64.0% since March 31, 2019. &#9679; Occupancy expense increased by $675,000, or 5.8% from the first quarter of 2019. This increase was mainly due to an increase in lease expense of $698,000 in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019. This increase was due to an increase in expense from new and renewed leases during 2019 along with adjustments made in the first quarter of 2019 from the adoption of the new lease standard. &#9679; FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges increased by $523,000, or 34.1% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This was due to the Bank&#8217;s growth together with changes in the risk assessment. &#8203; 

Income Tax Expense 

&#8203; 

Our effective income tax rate was 15.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to 20.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The lower effective tax rate was driven mainly by a significant decrease in pretax net income and an increase in federal tax credits in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019. Pretax income was reduced in the current quarter by the large provision for credit losses totaling $36.5 million stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. During the first quarter of 2020, the ACL increased by approximately $60.9 million due the adoption of ASU 2016-13 in the first quarter, as well as recording $36.5 million of provision for credit losses due to anticipated losses from COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the ACL resulted in a much larger change in deferred income taxes during the quarter than we normally experience.

&#8203; 

Capital Resources 

&#8203; 

Our ongoing capital requirements have been met primarily through retained earnings, less the payment of cash dividends. As of March 31, 2020, shareholders&#8217; equity was $2.3 billion, a decrease of $52.0 million, or 2.2%, from December 31, 2019, and a decrease of $55.4 million, or 2.3%, from $2.4 billion at March 31, 2019. The change from year-end was mainly attributable to the common stock dividend paid of $15.8 million, a reduction in capital of $24.7 million from the repurchase of 320,000 shares of common stock through our stock repurchase plans, and a reduction in retained earnings of $44.8 million from a cumulative change in accounting principle from the adoption of ASU 2016-13. These decreases in equity were partially offset by net income of $24.1 million and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $8.7 million. At March 31, 2020, we had an accumulated other comprehensive gain of $9.8 million compared to an accumulated other comprehensive gain of $1.0 million at December 31, 2019. This change was attributable to a $31.5 million, net of tax, improvement in the unrealized gain (loss) position in the available for sale securities portfolio and a $22.8 million, net of tax, decline in the unrealized gain (loss) position related to the cash flow hedges. The change in the unrealized gain (loss) position in the available for sale securities portfolio and the cash flow hedges are due to the decline in interest rates during the last half of 2019 and first quarter in 2020. The decrease in shareholders&#8217; equity from March 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to dividends paid to common shareholders of $60.1 million, a reduction in retained earnings of $44.8 million from a cumulative change in accounting principle from the adoption of ASU 2016-13 and a reduction in capital of $148.4 million from the repurchase of 1,985,000 shares of common stock through our stock repurchase plans. These decreases in equity were partially offset by net income of $166.2 million, an increase from accumulated other comprehensive income of $23.1 million and recognition of share based compensation expense of $8.7 million. Our common equity-to-assets ratio was 13.95% at March 31, 2020, down from 14.90% at December 31, 2019 and 15.42% at March 31, 2019. The decrease from December 31, 2019 was due to both a decrease in equity of 2.2% and an increase in total assets of 4.5%. This was mainly due to the reduction in equity during the first quarter of 2020 from a reduction in retained earnings of $44.8 million from a cumulative change in 

&#160; 

accounting principle from the adoption of ASU 2016-13 and our repurchase of 320,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $24.7 million. 

&#8203; 

On January 25, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a new program to repurchase up to 1,000,000 of our common stock, which were repurchased in the first and second quarter of 2019 at an average price of $69.89 per share (excluding commission expense) for a total of $69.9 million. In June 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 2,000,000 shares of our common stock after considering, among other things, our liquidity needs and capital resources as well as the estimated current value of our net assets (the &#8220;new Repurchase Program&#8221;). The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of the purchases during 2019 were based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of our common stock, and the availability of alternative investment opportunities. As of December 31, 2019, we had repurchased 1,165,000 shares at an average price of $74.72 a share (excluding sales commission) for a total of $87.1 million in common stock under the New Repurchase Program. During the first quarter of 2020, we remained active in repurchasing our common stock and bought 320,000 shares at an average price of $77.29 per share (excludes commission expense), a total of $24.7 million. There were 515,000 shares available for repurchase remaining under the New Repurchase Program as of March 31, 2020. 

&#8203; 

We are subject to regulations with respect to certain risk-based capital ratios. These risk-based capital ratios measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks. The values of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are adjusted based on the rules to reflect categorical credit risk. In addition to the risk-based capital ratios, the regulatory agencies have also established a leverage ratio for assessing capital adequacy. The leverage ratio is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by total consolidated on-balance sheet assets (minus amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital). The leverage ratio does not involve assigning risk weights to assets. 

&#8203; 

As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, regulatory capital rules adopted in July 2013 and fully-phased in as of January 1, 2019, which we refer to as the Basel III rules or Basel III, impose minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The Basel III rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with more than $3 billion in total consolidated assets. More stringent requirements are imposed on &#8220;advanced approaches&#8221; banking organizations which are organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, $10 billion or more in total foreign exposures, or that have opted into the Basel III capital regime. 

&#8203; 

Specifically, we are required to maintain the following minimum capital levels:

&#8203; 

&#9679; a CET1, risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; 

&#9679; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; 

&#9679; a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and

&#9679; a leverage ratio of 4%.

&#8203; 

Under Basel III, Tier 1 capital includes two components: CET1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The highest form of capital, CET1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, otherwise referred to as AOCI, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, Tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities (as discussed below). Tier 2 capital generally includes the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying preferred stock, subordinated debt and qualifying tier 2 minority interests, less any deductions in Tier 2 instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock is included only in Tier 2 capital, except that the Basel III rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets to continue to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 Capital (but not in CET1 capital), subject to certain restrictions. AOCI is presumptively included in CET1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. When implemented, Basel III provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI. We made this opt-out election and, as a result, retained our pre-existing treatment for AOCI. 

&#8203; 

In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, under Basel III, a banking organization must maintain a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three risk-

&#160; 

based measurements (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The 2.5% capital conservation buffer was phased in incrementally over time, and became fully effective for us on January 1, 2019, resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%.

&#8203; 

On December 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the implementation of CECL&#894; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the Day 1 adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL&#894; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing. CECL was adopted and became effective on January 1, 2020 and the Company applied the provisions of the standard using the modified retrospective method as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. Related to the implementation of ASU 2016-13, we recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of $54.4 million, deferred tax assets of $12.6 million, an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of $6.4 million and an adjustment to retained earnings of $44.8 million. Instead of recognizing the effects from ASU 2016-13 at adoption, the standard included a transitional method option for recognizing the Day 1 effects on the Company&#8217;s regulatory capital calculations over a three year phase-in. 

&#8203; 

In March 2020, in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, the regulatory agencies provided an additional transitional method option of a two years deferral for the start of the three year phase-in of the recognition of the Day 1 effects of ASU 2016-13 along with an option to defer the current impact on regulatory capital calculations of ASU 2016-13 during the first two years, otherwise referred to herein as the 5 year method. The Company would recognize an estimate of the previous method for determining the ACL in regulatory capital calculations and the difference from the CECL method would be deferred for two years. After two years, the effects from Day 1 and the deferral difference from the first two years of applying ASU 2016-13 would be phased-in over three years using the straight-line method. The regulatory rules provide a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2020 for covered banking organizations to choose its transition option for ASU 2016-13. The Company chose the 5 year method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from Day 1 and the CECL difference from the first two years of application. If the Company had not chosen to apply a transitional method related to ASU 2016-13, its consolidated common equity tier 1 to risk-weighted assets ratio would be 10.62%, its consolidated tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets would be 11.56%, its consolidated total capital to risk-weighted assets would be 12.81% and its consolidated tier 1 capital to average assets (leverage ratio) would be 9.23% at March 31, 2020. The Company would still exceed the thresholds for the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory classification. 

&#8203; 

The Bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized) and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three risk-based regulatory capital ratios (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital) and for the leverage ratio.

The Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased compared to December 31, 2019 due to the increase in our average assets and outpacing the increase in our tier 1 risk-based regulatory capital. The CET1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios all decreased compared to December 31, 2019 due to the increase in our risk-based assets outpacing the increase in our tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based regulatory capital. The main reason for 

&#160; 

the lesser increase in regulatory capital was due to our repurchase of 320,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $24.7 million through our stock repurchase plans in the first quarter of 2020 along with the lower net income this quarter. The main drivers for the increase in both average and risk-weighted assets were loan growth and growth in interest-bearing deposits. Our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory classification. 

&#8203; 

Liquidity 

&#8203; 

Liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations, which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits, extension of credit and payment of operating expenses. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) is charged with monitoring liquidity management policies, which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. We have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs. 

&#8203; 

Asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans, investment securities and other short-term investments. Management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and investments. Normally, changes in the earning asset mix are of a longer-term nature and are not utilized for day-to-day corporate liquidity needs. 

&#8203; 

Our liabilities provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings. We engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our Bank; &#9679; Pricing deposits, including certificates of deposit, at rate levels that will attract and/or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our Bank&#8217;s asset/liability management and net interest margin requirements; and &#9679; Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our Bank&#8217;s appeal as a primary provider of financial services. &#8203; 

Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by approximately $1.3 billion, or approximately 15.1%, compared to the balance at March 31, 2019, and by $310.1 million, or 13.5% annualized, compared to the balance at December 31, 2019. The acquired loan portfolio decreased by $887.0 million, or 31.3%, from the balance at March 31, 2019 and by $173.2 million, or 32.9%, annualized, from the balance at December 31, 2019 through principal paydowns, charge-offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans.

Our investment securities portfolio increased $29.0 million, or 5.8%, annualized, compared to the balance at December 31, 2019, and increased by $527.3 million, or 35.0% compared to the balance at March 31, 2019. The increase in investment securities from December 31, 2019 was a result of purchases of $104.0 million as well as improvements in the market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio of $40.5 million. These increases were partially offset by maturities, calls and paydowns of investment securities totaling $113.4 million. N et amortization of premiums were $2.7 million in the first three months of 2020. The increase in investment securities was due to the Company making the strategic decision to increase the size of the portfolio with the excess funds from deposit growth and the increase in other borrowings. Total cash and cash equivalents were $1.3 billion at March 31, 2020 as compared to $688.7 million at December 31, 2019 and $949.6 million at March 31, 2019. We borrowed an additional $300.0 million in FHLB advances and $200.0 million in FRB borrowings in the first quarter of 2020 as well as total deposits increased $167.5 million which improved liquidity in the first quarter of 2020. We borrowed an additional $500.0 million in the first quarter of 2020 to provide the Bank additional liquidity in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8203; 

At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had no traditional, out &#8211;of-market brokered deposits, and at March 31, 2019, we had $7.6 million in traditional, out-of-market brokered deposits. At March 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, we had $115.0 million, $45.8 million, and $60.1 million, respectively, of reciprocal brokered deposits. Total deposits were $12.3 billion at March 31, 2020, an increase of $167.5 million or 5.5% annualized from $12.2 billion at December 31, 2019 and an increase of $425.6 million or 3.6%, from $11.9 billion at March 31, 2019. Our deposit growth since December 31, 2019 included an increase in demand deposit accounts of $122.1 million and an 

&#160; 

increase in savings and money market accounts of $80.6 million partially offset by declines in interest-bearing transaction accounts of $25.8 million and in certificates of deposit of $9.5 million. Other borrowings increased $500.2 million and $699.9 million, respectively, from December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 to $1.3 billion at March 31, 2019. Other borrowings at March 31, 2020 included $1.2 billion in FHLB advances and FRB borrowing compared to $700.1 million at December 31, 2019 and $500.1 million at March 31, 2019. We had approximately $115 million in junior subordinated debt at March 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019. During the first quarter of 2019, we paid-off early the FHLB advance of $150.0 million that was outstanding at December 31, 2018 that would have matured in December 2019. We then borrowed $500 million in March 2019 and $200 million in June 2019 in 90-day fixed rate FHLB advances, which we currently plan to continuously renew. At the same time, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $350 million (a four year agreement) and $350 million (a five year agreement) to manage the interest rate risk related to these 90-day FHLB advances. We borrowed these FHLB advances to provide liquidity for operations, loan growth and investment growth. In March 2020, we executed another FHLB advance of $300.0 million at a rate of 0.47% for nine months and FRB borrowings of $200.0 million at a rate of 0.25% for three months. These borrowings executed in March 2020 were to provide additional liquidity in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent that we employ other types of non-deposit funding sources, typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers, we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds. Our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise.

&#8203; 

Our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position taking into account our current composition of earning assets, asset quality, capital position, and operating results. Our liquid earning assets include federal funds sold, balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, reverse repurchase agreements, and/or other short-term investments. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our Bank&#8217;s desired liquidity position at any time. We expect that these conditions would generally be of a short-term nature. Under such circumstances, our Bank&#8217;s federal funds sold position and any balances at the Federal Reserve Bank serve as the primary sources of immediate liquidity. At March 31, 2020, our Bank had total federal funds credit lines of $606.0 million with no balance outstanding. If additional liquidity were needed, the Bank would turn to short-term borrowings as an alternative immediate funding source and would consider other appropriate actions such as promotions to increase core deposits or the sale of a portion of our investment portfolio. At March 31, 2020, our Bank had $387.3 million of credit available at the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s Discount Window and had outstanding borrowing of $200.0 million resulting in $187.3 million remaining available at the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window. In addition, we could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks and/or the FHLB. At March 31, 2020, our Bank had a total FHLB credit facility of $2.5 billion with total outstanding FHLB letters of credit consuming $231.1 million, $1.0 billion in outstanding advances and $62,000 in credit enhancements from participation in the FHLB&#8217;s Mortgage Partnership Finance Program, leaving $1.2 billion in availability on the FHLB credit facility. The Company has a $25.0 million unsecured line of credit with U.S. Bank National Association with no outstanding advances. We believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available. 

&#8203; 

Our contingency funding plans incorporate several potential stages based on liquidity levels. Also, we review on at least an annual basis our liquidity position and our contingency funding plans with our principal banking regulator. We maintain various wholesale sources of funding. If our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful, we would utilize these alternative sources of funding. Under such circumstances, depending on the external source of funds, our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates we are charged. This could increase our cost of funds, impacting net interest margins and net interest spreads. 

&#8203; 

Deposit and Loan Concentrations 

&#8203; 

We have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers. We have no significant portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries. Furthermore, we attempt to avoid making loans that, in an aggregate amount, exceed 10% of total loans to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities. As of March 31, 2020, there were no aggregated loan concentrations of this type. We do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us. We do not have any foreign loans or deposits. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

&#8203; 

We consider concentrations of credit to exist when, pursuant to regulatory guidelines, the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents 25% of total risk-based capital, or $380.2 million at March 31, 2020. Based on this criteria, we had three such credit concentrations at March 31, 20120, including loans on hotels and motels of $590.0 million, loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings (except mini-warehouses) of $1.1 billion, and loans to lessors of residential buildings (investment properties and multi-family) of $591.4 million. The risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time. The loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard ACL methodology.

Banking regulators have established guidelines for the construction, land development and other land loans to total less than 100% of total risk-based capital and for total commercial real estate loans to total less than 300% of total risk-based capital. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank&#8217;s total risk-based capital. At March 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and March 31, 2019 the Bank&#8217;s construction, land development and other land loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 72.9%, 68.7%, and 63.2%, respectively. Commercial real estate loans (which includes construction, land development and other land loans along with other non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans) as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 229.5%, 225.6% and 219.2% as of March 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively. As of March 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Bank was below the established regulatory guidelines. When a bank&#8217;s ratios are in excess of one or both of these commercial real estate loan ratio guidelines, banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. Therefore, we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes.
