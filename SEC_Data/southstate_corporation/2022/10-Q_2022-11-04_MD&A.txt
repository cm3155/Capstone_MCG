References to the &#8220;Bank&#8221; means SouthState Corporation&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, SouthState Bank, National Association, a national banking association. 

Overview 

&#8203; 

SouthState Corporation is a financial holding company headquartered in Winter Haven, Florida, and was incorporated under the laws of South Carolina in 1985. We provide a wide range of banking services and products to our customers through our Bank. The Bank operates SouthState Advisory, Inc., a wholly owned registered investment advisor and SouthState/Duncan-Williams Securities Corp. (&#8220;Duncan-Williams&#8221;), a registered broker-dealer acquired on February 1, 2021 serving primarily institutional clients across the U.S. in the fixed income business from its headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. The Bank also owns CBI Holding Company, LLC (&#8220;CBI&#8221;), which in turn owns Corporate Billing, LLC (&#8220;Corporate Billing&#8221;), a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies, automotive parts and service providers nationwide. The holding company owns SSB Insurance Corp., a captive insurance subsidiary pursuant to Section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code. 

&#8203; 

At September 30, 2022, we had approximately $45.2 billion in assets and 5,074 full-time equivalent employees. Through our Bank branches, ATMs and online banking platforms, we provide our customers with a wide range of financial products and services, through a six (6) state footprint in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. These financial products and services include deposit accounts such as checking accounts, savings and time deposits of various types, safe deposit boxes, bank money orders, wire transfer and ACH services, brokerage services and alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds, trust and asset management services, loans of all types, including business loans, agriculture loans, real estate-secured (mortgage) loans, personal use loans, home improvement loans, automobile loans, manufactured housing loans, boat loans, credit cards, letters of credit, home equity lines of credit, treasury management services, and merchant services. 

&#8203; 

We also operate a correspondent banking and capital markets division within our national bank subsidiary, of which the majority of its bond salesmen, traders and operational personnel are housed in facilities located in Birmingham, Alabama and Atlanta, Georgia. This division&#8217;s primary revenue generating activities are related to its capital markets division, which includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities; and its correspondent banking division, which includes spread income earned on correspondent bank deposits (i.e., federal funds purchased) and correspondent bank checking account deposits and fees from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services for correspondents, asset/liability consulting related activities, international wires, and other clearing and corporate checking account services. 

&#8203; 

We have pursued, and continue to pursue, a growth strategy that focuses on organic growth, supplemented by acquisitions of select financial institutions, or branches in certain market areas or nonbanks that engage in financial services businesses complementary to the Bank&#8217;s business. 

&#8203; 

The following discussion describes our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and also analyzes our financial condition as of September 30, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 . Like most financial institutions, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we may pay interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is the amount of our net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and 

&#160; 

investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. 

Of course, there are risks inherent in all loans, as such, we maintain an allowance for credit losses, otherwise referred to herein as ACL, to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. We establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for credit losses against our operating earnings. In the following discussion, we have included a detailed discussion of this process. 

&#8203; 

In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers. We incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings, the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits. We describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion. 

&#8203; 

The following sections also identify significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report. 

Recent Events 

&#8203; 

We are continuously monitoring the impact of various global and national events on our results of operation and financial conditions, including inflation, and rising interest rates to combat elevated inflation, elevated gas and oil prices, continued supply chain disruptions, as a result of, among other factors, the Russian Ukraine conflict, and continued COVID-19 pandemic, and other global events. In particular, growth in economic activity and demand for goods and services, alongside labor shortages and supply chain complications, has contributed to rising inflation. In response, the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and signaled that it will continue to raise rates and taper its purchase of mortgage and other bonds. While employment figures show resilience, it is widely acknowledged that the chances of recession have increased. During the third quarter of 2022, we recorded provision for credit losses of approximately $23.9 million, including the provision for unfunded commitments. The continued impacts from the various global and national events listed above, may result in additional provision for credit losses in the future. Please see &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; in this MD&#38;A for more information on the Company&#8217;s analysis of expected credit losses. 

&#8203; 

Nevertheless, the timing and impact of inflation and rising interest rates on our business, financial statements and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.

Atlantic Capital Bancshares, Inc. (&#8220;Atlantic Capital&#8221; or &#8220;ACBI&#8221;) Merger 

On March 1, 2022, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Atlantic Capital, the holding company for Atlantic Capital Bank, N.A. (&#8220;ACB&#8221;), in a stock transaction. Pursuant to the merger agreement, (i) Atlantic Capital merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger, and (ii) immediately following the merger, ACB merged with and into SouthState Bank, N.A. (&#8220;SSB&#8221;), with SSB continuing as the surviving bank in the bank merger. 

Under the terms of the merger agreement, shareholders of Atlantic Capital received 0.36 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock for each share of Atlantic Capital common stock they owned. In total, the purchase price for Atlantic Capital was $657.8 million. 

In the acquisition, the Company acquired $2.4 billion of loans, including PPP loans, at fair value, net of $54.3 million, or 2.24%, estimated discount to the outstanding principal balance, representing 10.0% of the Company&#8217;s total loans at December 31, 2021. Of the total loans acquired, Management identified $137.9 million that had more than insignificantly deteriorated since origination and were thus determined to be PCD loans. Additional details regarding the Atlantic Capital merger are discussed in Note 4 &#8212; Mergers and Acquisitions.

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Branch Consolidation and Other Cost Initiatives 

&#8203; 

During the third quarter of 2022, the Company consolidated thirty-one branches across its branch footprint into nearby existing Bank branches. Through September 30, 2022, the cost associated with these branch closures was approximately $8.0 million, which primarily includes personnel, facilities and equipment cost.

Debit Card Transaction Processing Update 

&#8203; 

On October 3, 2022, the Federal Reserve finalized a rule that amends Regulation II to, among other things, specify that debit card issuers should enable all debit card transactions, including card-not-present transactions such as online payments, to be processed on at least two unaffiliated payment card networks. The final rule becomes effective July 1, 2023. As an issuer with over $10 billion in assets, we are subject to Regulation II and will work to implement these new requirements. 

Deposit Insurance Assessments 

&#8203; 

On October 18, 2022, the FDIC finalized a rule that would increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The FDIC, as required under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, established a plan in September 2020 to restore the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent within eight years. This plan did not include an increase in the deposit insurance assessment rate. Based on the FDIC&#8217;s recent projections, however, the FDIC determined that the DIF reserve ratio is at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028 without increasing the deposit insurance assessment rates. The increased assessment would improve the likelihood that the DIF reserve ratio would reach the required minimum by the statutory deadline, consistent with the FDIC&#8217;s Amended Restoration Plan. The rule will become effective as of January 1, 2023. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

&#8203; 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the banking industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by Management&#8217;s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 2 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 &#8212; Recent Accounting and Regulatory Pronouncements of our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

&#8203; 

The following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.

&#8203; 

Allowance for Credit Losses or ACL 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects Management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. Management uses a systematic methodology to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment, which includes the evaluation of baseline and alternative scenarios, as well as other current economic data, to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses during each reporting period. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and makes adjustments, as needed, during each period end. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion. The Company&#8217;s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects Management&#8217;s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for Management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses. See 

&#160; 

Note 2 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL. See also Note 7 &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; in this MD&#38;A .

&#8203; 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

&#8203; 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in a business combination. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the balance of goodwill was $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. As a result of the Atlantic Capital merger on March 1, 2022, the Company recognized additional goodwill of $341.4 million. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset&#8217;s fair value. 

&#8203; 

Our most recent evaluation of goodwill was performed as of October 31, 2021, and we determined that no impairment charge was necessary. Our stock price has traded above book value and tangible book value in the first nine months of 2022. Our stock price closed on September 30, 2022 at $79.12, which was above book value of $65.03 and tangible book value of $37.97. We will continue to monitor the impact of inflation, COVID-19 and other global events on the Company&#8217;s business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. If the economy deteriorates and our stock price falls below current levels, we will have to reevaluate the impact on our financial condition and potential impairment of goodwill. 

&#8203; 

Core deposit intangibles and client list intangibles consist primarily of amortizing assets established during the acquisition of other banks. This includes whole bank acquisitions and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities from other financial institutions. Core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of long-term deposit relationships acquired in these transactions. Client list intangibles represent the value of long-term client relationships for the correspondent banking, wealth and trust management businesses. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives, such as deposit accounts in the case of core deposit intangible, on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from this intangible. The estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness. 

Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets 

&#8203; 

Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in our consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of certain assets and liabilities, including loans, available for sale securities, ACL, write downs of OREO properties and bank properties held for sale, accumulated depreciation, net operating loss carry forwards, accretion income, deferred compensation, intangible assets, mortgage servicing rights, and post-retirement benefits. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that a deferred tax asset is not realizable. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2022 were $198.7 million, an increase of approximately $133.7 million compared to $65.0 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase in deferred tax assets during the first nine months of 2022 was mostly attributable to a $227.2 million increase in unrealized losses from the available for sale securities portfolio, as well as the addition of $30.4 million of net deferred tax assets acquired from Atlantic Capital, offset by a $109.4 million decrease in the mark-to-market adjustment pertaining to loans with the remaining difference due to other temporary differences. 

&#8203; 

The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Additionally, income tax returns are filed by the Company or its subsidiaries in the states of Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia and in New York City. We evaluate the need for income tax reserves related to uncertain income tax positions but had no material reserves at September 30, 2022 or December 31, 2021. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Other Real Estate Owned and Bank Property Held For Sale 

&#8203; 

Other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;) consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans. Both OREO and bank property held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and the fair value was determined on the basis of current valuations obtained principally from independent sources and adjusted for estimated selling costs. For OREO, at the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral, any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the ACL. At the time a bank property is no longer in service and is moved to held for sale, any excess of the current book value over fair value is recorded as an expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Subsequent adjustments to this value are described below in the following paragraph. 

&#8203; 

We report subsequent declines in the fair value of OREO and bank properties held for sale below the new cost basis through valuation adjustments. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of these properties, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility. In response to market conditions and other economic factors, Management may use liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy. As a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from the current valuations used to determine the fair value of these properties. Management reviews the value of these properties periodically and adjusts the values as appropriate. Revenue and expenses from OREO operations, as well as gains or losses on sales and any subsequent adjustments to the value, are recorded as OREO and Loan Related expense, a component of Noninterest Expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. For bank property held for sale, any adjustments to fair value, as well as gains or losses on sales, are recorded in Other Expense, a component of Noninterest Expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Results of Operations 

&#8203; 

Overview 

&#8203; 

We reported consolidated net income of $133.0 million, or diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) of $1.75, for the third quarter of 2022 as compared to consolidated net income of $122.8 million, or diluted EPS of $1.74, in the comparable period of 2021, an 8.4% increase in consolidated net income and a 0.4% increase in diluted EPS. The $10.3 million increase in consolidated net income was the net result of the following items: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; A $103.4 million increase in interest income, resulting from a $66.8 million increase in interest income from loans, a $22.1 million increase in interest income from investment securities and a $14.5 million increase in interest income from federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. These increases were mainly due to the increase in yields in the current rising rate environment in all categories of interest-earning assets along with the increase in the average balance of both loans and investment securities; &#9679; A $5.1 million increase in interest expense, which resulted from a $2.9 million increase in interest expense from deposits, $1.2 million increase in interest expense in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and a $1.1 million increase in interest expense from corporate and subordinated debentures. These increases were primarily due to an increase in average costs in the current rising rate environment; &#9679; A $9.8 million decrease in noninterest income, which resulted primarily from a decrease in mortgage banking income of $13.3 million and a decrease in correspondent banking and capital market income of $4.6 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in service charges on deposits accounts and deposit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income of $4.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively. In addition, SBA income, bank owned life insurance income and trust and investment services income increased by $2.4 million, $1.0 million and by $0.5 million, respectively. (See Noninterest Income section on page 56 for further discussion); &#9679; An $8.1 million increase in noninterest expense, which resulted primarily from an increase in other noninterest expense of $5.7 million, an increase in salary and employee benefits of $2.6 million, an increase in FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges of $2.1 million and an increase in information services expense of $2.7 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in merger and branch consolidation related expense of $3.9 million. (See Noninterest Expense section on page 58 for further discussion); 

&#160; 

&#9679; A $62.8 million increase in the provision for allowance for credit losses, as the Company recorded provision for credit losses of $23.9 million during the third quarter of 2022 while recording a release of the allowance for credit losses of $38.9 million in the third quarter of 2021; and &#9679; A $7.2 million increase in the provision for income taxes primarily due to the change in pretax book income between the two quarters. The Company recorded pretax book income of $171.1 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to pretax book income of $153.6 million in the third quarter of 2021. Our effective tax rate was 22.23% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 20.06% for the three months ended September 30, 2021. &#8203; 

Our quarterly efficiency ratio declined to 53.1% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 64.2% in the third quarter of 2021. The improvement in the efficiency ratio compared to the third quarter of 2021 was the result of the 25.5% increase in the total of tax-equivalent (&#8220;TE&#8221;) net interest income and noninterest income partially offset by the effects of a 4.0% increase in noninterest expense (excluding amortization of intangibles). The improvement in the efficiency ratio this quarter was mainly due to the $98.2 million increase in net interest income as interest income has increased significantly in the current rising rate environment. 

&#8203; 

Basic and diluted EPS were $1.76 and $1.75, respectively, for the third quarter of 2022, compared to $1.75 and $1.74, respectively for the third quarter of 2021. The increase in basic and diluted EPS was due to a 8.4% increase in net income in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, partially offset by an increase in average common shares. The increase in average basic common shares was due to the Company issuing 7.3 million shares on March 1, 2022 with the Atlantic Capital acquisition, less the 2.1 million of stock repurchases completed by the Company between September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2022.

&#8203; 

&#9679; For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the return on average assets declined for both periods compared to 2021. The return on average equity and the return on average tangible equity increased for the three months ended September 30, 2022 while for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, both ratios decreased compared to the same period in 2021. o The decrease in the return on average assets for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was due to the percentage increase in average assets being greater than the percentage increase in net income. For the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021, average assets increased 11.7% while net income increased 8.4%. The increase in average assets was mainly due to both increases in loans and investment securities through both the ACBI acquisition and organic growth. o The increases in the return on average equity and the return on average tangible equity for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 were primarily due to the percentage increase in net income of 8.4% being greater than the increases in average equity or tangible equity of 7.3% and 0.6%, respectively. The increase in net income was mainly due to an increase in net interest income of $98.2 million, partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses of $62.8 million, a decrease in non-interest income of $9.8 million, and an increase in non-interest expense of $8.1 million. o For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the decreases in the return on average equity and the return on average tangible equity were due to the decrease in net income of $16.2 million, or 4.4%. The decrease in net income was mainly attributable to the provision for credit losses of $34.7 million recorded during the first nine months of 2022 compared to a negative provision (recovery) for credit 

&#160; 

losses of $156.1 million recorded during the first nine months of 2021. The average equity and the average tangible equity increased $323.1 million and $69.8 million, respectively, in 2022 compared to 2021 as a result of the equity issued for the acquisition of Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022 and the net income of the company, which was partially offset by the stock repurchases completed by the Company through September 30, 2022. &#9679; Equity to assets ratios for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 was 10.89%, a decrease of 0.83% from September 30, 2021, which was mainly due to the increase in total assets resulting from higher levels of investment securities and loans acquired through the Atlantic Capital transaction completed on March 1, 2022 and through organic growth. In addition, the decrease was due to the impact from the change in accumulated other comprehensive loss. &#9679; Dividend payout ratios were 28.44% and 30.82% for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2022, respectively, and 27.94% and 27.39% for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2021, respectively. The increase in the dividend payout ratio for the three months period ending September 30, 2022 was due the 8.4% increase in net income while total dividends paid during the current quarter increased 10.3% compared to the same period in 2021. The dividend payout ratio for the nine months period ending September 30, 2022 increased due to lower net income and higher dividend paid per share compared to the same period in 2021. The dividend paid per share was $0.50 per share during the third quarter of 2022 and $1.48 for the first nine months of 2022 compared to $0.49 per share during the third quarter of 2021 and $1.43 for the first nine months of 2021. &#8203; 

Net Interest Income and Margin 

&#8203; 

Non-TE net interest income increased $98.2 million, or 37.8%, to $358.2 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $260.0 million in the same period in 2021. Interest-earning assets averaged $40.2 billion during the three months period ended September 30, 2022 compared to $36.2 billion for the same period in 2021, an increase of $4.0 billion, or 11.1% which was in part due to the acquisition of Atlantic Capital completed on March 1, 2022 and organic growth. Interest-bearing liabilities averaged $25.1 billion during the three months period ended September 30, 2022 compared to $23.5 billion for the same period in 2021, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 7.0%, which was also partly due to the interest-bearing liabilities assumed from the acquisition of Atlantic Capital. 

&#8203; 

In March of 2020, the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rates remained at this low level until mid-March 2022, when the Federal Reserve approved its first federal funds target rate increase in more than three years to a range of 0.25% to 0.50%. In early May 2022, the Federal Reserve approved a 50 basis points rate increase and later a 75 basis points increase in June 2022. The Federal Reserve subsequently approved two 75 basis points increases, first increase in late July 2022 and the most recent increase effective late September 2022, resulting a range of 3.00% to 3.25%. As a result, the Company operated under an increasing rate environment for the entire third quarter of 2022. Some key highlights are outlined below: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Both the non-TE and TE net interest margin increased by 68 basis points and 69 basis points, respectively, in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter of 2021. While the yield on interest-earning assets increased 73 basis points, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities marginally increased 7 basis points compared to the same period in 2021. The increase in the net interest margin was primarily due to the rising rate environment in effect during the third quarter of 2022 and changes in the interest earning asset mix. During the current quarter, the average balance of higher yielding non-acquired loans increased by $5.5 billion while the average balance of lower yielding federal fund sold, reverse repos and other interest-earning declined by $2.9 billion compared to the third quarter of 2021. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased only 7 basis points in the rising rate environment as interest-bearing liabilities have been slower to reprice. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 4 basis points to 0.17% during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. &#9679; Non-TE yield on interest-earning assets for the third quarter of 2022 increased 73 basis points to 3.70% from the comparable period in 2021. The yield on all interest-earning assets increased as the Federal Reserve Bank began to raise interest rates late in the first quarter of 2022. The increase in interest rates, in combination with the increase in higher yielding non-acquired loans of $5.5 billion, affected the overall yield increase between the comparable periods. 

&#160; 

&#9679; The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the third quarter of 2022 increased 7 basis points from the same period in 2021. Our overall cost of funds, including noninterest-bearing deposits, was 0.17% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 0.13% for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 4 basis points as the cost of interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts and savings accounts increased 9 basis points. These increases were partially offset as the cost of time deposits declined 22 basis points compared to the same period in 2021 as these interest-bearing deposits are slower to reprice in a rising rate environment. The overall cost of funds also increased due to a $65.8 million average balance increase in corporate and subordinated debentures, which generally carry a higher interest rate, compared to the third quarter of 2021. The Company assumed $78.4 million in subordinated debentures with the acquisition of ACBI , which it closed on March 1, 2022, and subsequently redeemed $13.0 million of subordinated debentures on June 30, 2022. The net increase in corporate and subordinated debentures, along with the effect of the rising rate environment, resulted in an increase in the cost of corporate debt. &#8203;

(1) Investment securities (taxable) and (tax-exempt) include trading securities. Investment Securities 

&#8203; 

Interest earned on investment securities was higher in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The average balance of investment securities increased $2.6 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 from the comparable periods in 2021. The yield on the investment securities increased 55 basis points and 45 basis points, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. Both the average balance and the yield on the investment securities increased as the Bank used a portion of the excess funds to strategically increase the size of its investment securities, along with the Bank&#8217;s strategy on replacing lower yielding securities with higher yielding securities as interest rates started to increase in the first quarter of 2022, in addition to retaining a portion of the investment securities acquired from Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022. The excess liquidity was from the continuous growth in deposits since 2021 and in the first nine months of 2022. 

Loans 

&#8203; 

Interest earned on loans held for investment increased $67.5 million, to $312.2 million and increased $69.3 million to $816.2 million, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 from the comparable periods in 2021. Interest earned on loans held for investment included loan accretion income recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 of $9.6 million, $29.1 million, $5.2 million, and $22.0 million, respectively, an increase of $4.3 million and $7.1 million, respectively. Some key highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 are outlined below:

&#160; 

&#9679; Our non-TE yield on total loans increased 31 basis points in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 due to the effects from the rising rate environment in 2022. The yields on both the acquired and the non-acquired loan portfolios increased 56 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively. The average balance of the lower yielding non-acquired loan portfolio increased $5.5 billion in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 while the average balance of the higher yielding acquired loan portfolio declined by $1.0 billion. o The yield on the acquired loan portfolio increased from 4.43% in the third quarter of 2021 to 4.99% in the same period in 2022. &#9726; Interest income on acquired loans slightly decreased by $129,000, primarily due to a decrease in the average balance. The effects from the decrease in average balance were offset by an increase in yield of 56 basis points mainly due to an increase in accretion income of $4.3 million to $9.6 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. This increase was mainly attributable to accretion income recognized for the Atlantic Capital transaction. &#9726; For the a cquired loans, the average balance decreased by $1.0 billion. The decrease in the average balance in the acquired loan portfolio was due to paydowns, pay-offs and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. o The yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio increased to 4.13% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 3.83% in the same period in 2021. &#9726; Interest income increased by $67.6 million, due to an increase in the average balance of $5.5 billion compared to the same period in 2021. &#9726; T he average balance of non-acquired loans increased primarily through organic loan growth and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. o With the rise in interest rates starting late in March 2022, we continued to see an increase in the yield on loans during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the previous quarter. &#8203; 

Interest-Bearing Liabilities 

&#8203; 

The quarter-to-date average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $1.6 billion, or 7.0%, in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Overall cost of funds, including demand deposits, increased by 4 basis points to 0.17% in the third quarter of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. Some key highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 include: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; The cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.17% for the third quarter of 2022 compared to 0.13% for the same period in 2021. o Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 as interest expense on interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts and savings accounts increased $5.1 million while interest expense on time deposits declined $2.2 million, as these deposits are slower to reprice in a rising rate environment. o The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by $1.8 billion, primarily due to the interest-bearing deposits of $1.6 billion assumed from the Atlantic Capital acquisition on March 1, 2022. The average balance of lower costing interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts and savings accounts increased $2.4 billion while the average balance of higher costing time deposits declined $629.2 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Overall, interest-bearing deposits have been slower to reprice in the rising rate environment. &#9679; The cost on the corporate and subordinated debt increased by 28 basis points to 5.01% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 driven by the effects from the rising rate environment on the repricing of variable rate trust preferred corporate debt. o The interest expense from corporate and subordinated debt increased $1.1 million during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. o The average balance of corporate and subordinated debt increased by $65.8 million due to the $78.4 million of subordinated debentures assumed from Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022, partially offset by the redemption of $13.0 million of subordinated debentures in late June 2022. &#9679; The cost of federal funds purchased increased 208 basis points due to the rising rate environment in the third quarter of 2022. Although the average balance decreased by $239.1 million, the increase of $1.2 million in the interest expense was due to increase in average cost. &#9679; There were no outstanding balances in other borrowings during 2022. The $25.0 million borrowed on a line of 

&#160; 

credit in June 2021 was repaid in July of 2021. &#8203; 

We continue to monitor and adjust rates paid on deposit products as part of our strategy to manage our net interest margin. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits, CDs, other time deposits, federal funds purchased, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include NOW, HSA, IOLTA, and Market Rate checking accounts. 

Noninterest-Bearing Deposits 

&#8203; 

Noninterest-bearing deposits are transaction accounts that provide our Bank with &#8220;interest-free&#8221; sources of funds. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $2.6 billion, or 23.4%, to $13.9 billion in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $11.3 billion during the same period in 2021. The increase in average noninterest-bearing deposits was primarily due to our focus on relationship banking and the overall liquidity in the banking system. The Company also acquired noninterest-bearing deposit balances from Atlantic Capital during the first quarter of 2022, which affected the average balance for the third quarter of 2022. The noninterest-bearing deposit balances from Atlantic Capital on the acquisition date were approximately $1.4 billion in total.

&#8203;

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, noninterest income comprised 21.2%, and 25.3%, respectively, of total net interest income and noninterest income.

Noninterest income decreased by $9.8 million, or 11.3%, during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. This quarterly change in total noninterest income resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Mortgage banking income decreased by $13.3 million, or 85.5%, during the current quarter compared to the same period prior year, which was comprised of $12.6 million, or 89.1%, decrease from mortgage income in the secondary market and a $708,000, or 49.3%, decrease from mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge. During the current quarter, the Company allocated a lower percentage of its mortgage production and pipeline to the secondary market compared to the same quarter in 2021, which resulted in a decrease in mortgage income from the secondary market. The allocation of mortgage production between portfolio and secondary market depends on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate quarter to quarter. o During the third quarter of 2022, mortgage income from the secondary market comprised of a $3.6 million decrease in the change in fair value of the pipeline, loans held for sale and MBS forward trades and a $9.0 million decrease in gain on sale of mortgage loans, which is net of the commission expense related to mortgage production. Mortgage commission expense was $2.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $6.5 million during the comparable period in 2021. o The decrease in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge, in the three months ended September 30, 2022 was due to a $1.1 million decrease in the change in fair value of the MSR, including decay, offset by a $388,000 increase in mortgage servicing fee income. The decrease in the change in fair value of the MSR was primarily due to an increase in losses on the MSR hedge of $3.0 million, offset by an increase in the change in fair value from interest rates of $1.0 million and a $897,000 decline in MSR 

&#160; 

decay as interest rates have increased since the third quarter of 2021. The increase in servicing fee resulted from the increase in size of the servicing portfolio. &#9679; Correspondent banking and capital markets income for the third quarter of 2022 decreased by $4.6 million from the third quarter of 2021. The decline was due to lower commissions and fees earned on fixed income security sales during the third quarter as the volume in sales declined from the prior period. The income from this business includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities. &#9679; Service charges on deposit accounts was higher by $4.2 million, or 26.2%, in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, mainly due to the increase in customers and activity through the Atlantic Capital merger completed during the first quarter of 2022. The total increase primarily consists of increases in service charge account maintenance fees of $3.4 million and in NSF and Automated Overdraft Privilege (&#8220;AOP&#8221;) charges of $637,000. &#9679; Debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was higher by $843,000, or 8.4%, in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021. The increase in debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was mainly driven by higher debit card income, credit card sales incentive, and merchant card income resulting from the increase in activity related to the acquisition of Atlantic Capital completed in the first quarter of 2022. Debit card income, credit card sales incentive, and merchant card related increased by $221,000, $431,000, and by $215,000, respectively. &#9679; Bank owned life insurance income increased $950,000, or 18.5%, in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021. This increase was due to the purchase of $86.0 million of new policies since March 2022 and the addition of $74.6 million in BOLI through the acquisition of Atlantic Capital completed in the first quarter of 2022. &#9679; SBA income, including the impact from the change to fair value accounting during 2022, increased by $2.4 million, or 59.7% compared to the third quarter of 2021. SBA income includes changes in fair value of the servicing asset, loan servicing fees and gains on sale of SBA loans. The increase is mainly attributable to additional business resulting from the acquisition of Atlantic Capital. &#8203; 

Noninterest income decreased by $10.8 million, or 4.1%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. This change in total noninterest income resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Mortgage banking income decreased by $34.2 million, or 65.1%, which was comprised of $36.0 million, or 72.0%, decrease from mortgage income in the secondary market, offset by a $1.7 million, or 66.4%, increase from mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge. During the current year, the Company allocated a lower percentage of its mortgage production and pipeline to the secondary market compared to 2021, which resulted in a decrease in mortgage income from the secondary market. The allocation of mortgage production between portfolio and secondary market depends on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate quarter to quarter. o During the first nine months of 2022, mortgage income from the secondary market comprised of a $0.6 million decrease in the change in fair value of the pipeline, loans held for sale and MBS forward trades and a $35.4 million decrease in gain on sale of mortgage loans, which is net of the commission expense related to mortgage production. Mortgage commission expense was $11.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $22.4 million during the comparable period in 2021. o The increase in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge, in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was due to a $171,000 increase in the change in fair value of the MSR, including decay, and a $1.6 million increase from servicing fee income. The fair value from interest rates increased $10.7 million as interest rates have increased starting March 2022 and the decrease in the change in fair value of the MSR was due to an increase in losses on the MSR hedge, including decay, of $10.5 million. The increase in servicing fee resulted from the increase in size of the servicing portfolio. &#9679; Correspondent banking and capital markets income for 2022 decreased by $3.6 million compared to 2021. The decline was due to lower commissions and fees earned on fixed income security sales during 2022 as the volume in sales declined from 2021, partially offset by an increase in adjustable rate credit loan hedging income. &#9679; Service charges on deposit accounts were higher in 2022 by $13.4 million, or 28.4%, compared to 2021, due primarily to the increase in customers and activity through the Atlantic Capital merger completed during the first quarter of 2022. The increase includes service charge account maintenance fees of $7.7 million, in NSF and AOP charges of $4.0 million and in other retail fees including wire transfer fees of $1.7 million. &#9679; Debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was higher by $5.0 million, or 17.8%, in 2022 

&#160; 

compared to 2021. The increase in debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was mainly driven by higher debit card, credit card sales incentive, ATM and merchant card income due to the increase in activity related to the merger with Atlantic Capital completed in the first quarter of 2022. The nine months ended September 30, 2022 included activity from Atlantic Capital from March 1, 2022 through September 30, 2022. Debit card income, credit card sales incentive, and foreign ATM fee income increased by $3.2 million, $1.3 million, and by $668,000, respectively. &#9679; Bank owned life insurance income increased $4.1 million, or 30.5%, in 2022 compared to 2021. This increase was due to the purchase of $86.0 million of new policies since March 2022 and the addition of $74.6 million in BOLI resulting from the acquisition of Atlantic Capital in the first quarter of 2022. &#9679; SBA income, including the impact from the change to fair value accounting, increased by $4.5 million, or 47.9% in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase is mainly due to additional business resulting from the acquisition of Atlantic Capital. Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense increased by $8.1 million, or 3.5%, in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. The quarterly increase in total noninterest expense primarily resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; An increase in salaries and employee benefits of $2.6 million, or 1.9%, in the three months period ending September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher base salaries and wages resulting from the addition of Atlantic Capital employees and normal raises and salary increases during the year, in addition to an increase in incentive expenses resulting from the addition of Atlantic Capital employees in March 2022, higher loan production volumes and the Company&#8217;s strong performance during the current period, which led to higher incentive accruals. This was partially offset by higher deferred loan costs, which are applied against salaries and employee benefits, caused by higher loan production volumes and an update in the Company&#8217;s standard loan costs during 2022. Also, commissions expense declined in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 by $1.3 million mainly due to a decline of $1.5 million in commission expense related to bond sales as the volume in bond sales declined in 2022. During the current quarter, we recorded a total of $7.8 million in commission and $15.8 million in retail and loan incentives expenses compared to $10.1 million and $11.2 million, respectively, during the comparable period in 2021. &#9679; An increase in information services expense of $2.7 million, or 14.7%, due to additional cost associated with systems added through our acquisition of Atlantic Capital along with the cost of the Company updating systems as it grows in size and complexity. &#9679; An increase in FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges of $2.0 million, or 48.4%, in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was mainly due to an increase in the FDIC assessment of $2.0 million as the Company continues to grow in size and complexity. &#9679; An increase in other noninterest expense of $5.1 million, or 46.9%, compared to the third quarter of 2021. This increase was primarily due to increases in fraud, digital banking and miscellaneous operational charge-off related expenses of $2.4 million, increases in incurred but not reported insurance loss reserves of $894,000 and increases in donations of $587,000. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company contributed $250,000 to charities to help those impacted by Hurricane Ian. 

&#160; 

&#9679; A decrease in merger and branch consolidation related expense of $3.9 million compared to the third quarter of 2021. The expense in the third quarter of 2022 consists of branch consolidations and the merger related costs pertaining to the Atlantic Capital merger. The expense in the third quarter of 2021 mainly consisted of costs related to the merger with CenterState. &#8203; 

Noninterest expense decreased by $24.2 million, or 3.3%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The categories and explanations for the increases year-to-date, except the items discussed below, are similar to the ones noted above in the quarterly comparison. 

&#9679; A decrease in extinguishment of debt cost of $11.7 million in the third quarter of 2022. The cost incurred in the second quarter of 2021 was from the write-off of the unamortized purchase accounting adjustment recorded on the trust preferred securities assumed in the CenterState merger. All of the trust preferred securities assumed in the CenterState merger were redeemed in June 2021. &#9679; A decrease in merger and branch consolidation related expense of $31.3 million, or 51.6%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The expense in 2022 consists mainly of costs associated with branch consolidations and the merger related costs pertaining to the Atlantic Capital acquisition. The expense in 2021 mainly consisted of costs related to the merger with CenterState. &#9679; An increase in other noninterest expense of $11.9 million, or 32.7%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This increase was due to increases in fraud, digital banking and miscellaneous operational charge-off related expenses of $5.6 million, increases on loan production expenses of $2.0 million, expense related to the settlement of a lawsuit of $2.6 million, increases in tax penalties of $635,000, increases in incurred but not reported insurance loss reserves of $663,000 and increases in donations of $648,000. &#9679; An increase in professional fees of $3.6 million, or 44.9%, in the nine months period ending September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was primarily due to increases in non-legal and advisory and committee related fees. &#9679; An increase in FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges of $3.4 million, or 26.3%, in the nine months period ending September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was mainly due to an increase in the FDIC assessment of $2.7 million and OCC examination fee of $670,000 as the Company continues to grow in size and complexity. &#9679; An increase in information services expense of $3.9 million, or 7.0%, due to additional cost associated with systems added through our acquisition of Atlantic Capital, along with the cost of the Company updating systems as it grows in size and complexity. Income Tax Expense 

&#8203; 

Our effective tax rate was 22.23% and 21.76% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 20.06% and 21.41% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate for the quarter was driven by an increase in pre-tax book income, an increase in non-deductible executive compensation, and additional expense related to return to provision items recorded during the quarter. These balances were partially offset by an increase in federal tax credits available, an increase in tax-exempt income and an increase in the cash surrender value of BOLI policies held. 

&#8203; 

The increase in the year-to-date effective tax rate compared to the same period of 2021 was driven by the increase in non-deductible executive compensation, an increase in non-deductible FDIC premiums, and additional expense related to return to provision items recorded during the quarter. The increase was partially offset by an increase in tax-exempt income and an increase in the cash surrender value of BOLI policies held, and an increase in federal tax credits available in the current year compared to the same period in 2021. 

Analysis of Financial Condition 

Summary 

Our total assets increased approximately $3.2 billion, or 7.7%, from December 31, 2021 to September 30, 2022, to approximately $45.2 billion. Within total assets, loans increased $4.9 billion, or 20.5%, investment securities increased $1.1 billion, or 15.5%, while cash and cash equivalents decreased $4.0 billion, or 58.9% during the period. Within total liabilities, deposit growth was $2.6 billion, or 7.4%, corporate and subordinated debentures increased $65.3 

&#160; 

million, or 20.0%, while federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchased decreased $223.4 million, or 28.6%. Total shareholder&#8217;s equity increased $118.2 million, or 2.5%. The increases in loans, investments, total assets, deposits, borrowings and shareholder&#8217;s equity were mainly attributable to the acquisition of Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022 in addition to organic growth. Our loan to deposit ratio was 77% and 68% at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Investment Securities 

&#8203; 

We use investment securities, our second largest category of earning assets, to generate interest income through the deployment of excess funds, provide liquidity, fund loan demand or deposit liquidation, and pledge as collateral for public funds deposits, repurchase agreements and derivative exposure. At September 30, 2022, investment securities totaled $8.3 billion, compared to $7.2 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 15.5%. The Atlantic Capital acquisition added $691.7 million of investment securities available for sale to our portfolio. We immediately sold $414.4 million in securities, after principal paydowns, and retained $273.7 million in our portfolio. The Atlantic Capital securities retained were mostly state and municipal obligations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we purchased $2.5 billion of securities, $1.1 billion classified as held to maturity, $1.4 billion classified as available for sale and $20.4 million classified as other investment securities. These purchases were partially offset by maturities, paydowns, sales and calls of investment securities totaling $1.1 billion. Net amortization of premiums was $21.5 million in the first nine months of 2022. The decrease in fair value in the available for sale investment portfolio of $922.5 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 was mainly due to an increase in both short term and long term interest rates during the nine months period ending September 30, 2022. 

&#8203; 

The following is the combined amortized cost and fair value of investment securities available for sale and held for maturity, aggregated by credit quality indicator:

* Agency mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;), agency collateralized mortgage-obligations (CMO) and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;) are guaranteed by the issuing government-sponsored enterprise (&#8220;GSE&#8221;) as to the timely payments of principal and interest. Except for Government National Mortgage Association securities, which have the full faith and credit backing of the United States Government, the GSE alone is responsible for making payments on this guaranty. While the rating agencies have not rated any of the MBS, CMO and CMBS issued, senior debt securities issued by GSEs are rated consistently as &#8220;Triple-A.&#8221; Most market participants consider agency MBS, CMOs and CMBSs as carrying an implied Aaa rating (S&#38;P rating of AA+) because of the guarantees of timely payments and selection criteria of mortgages backing the securities. We do not own any private label mortgage-backed securities. The balances presented under the ratings above reflect the amortized cost of the investment securities. 

At September 30, 2022 , we had 1,326 investment securities (including both available for sale and held to maturity) in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $1.4 billion. At December 31, 2021, we had 296 investment securities (including both available for sale and held to maturity) in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $106.0 million. The total number of investment securities with an unrealized loss position increased by 1,030 securities, while the total dollar amount of the unrealized loss increased by $1.3 billion. The increase in both the number of investment securities in a loss position and the total unrealized loss from December 31, 2021 is due to an increase in short term and long term interest rates during the first nine months of 2022. 

&#8203; 

All investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2022 continue to perform as scheduled. We have evaluated the securities and have determined that the decline in fair value, relative to its amortized cost, is not due to credit-related factors. In addition, we have the ability to hold these securities within the portfolio until maturity or until the value recovers, and we believe that it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovery. We continue to monitor all of our securities with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that we will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of our securities may be sold or would require a charge to earnings as a provision for credit losses in such periods. Any charges as a provision for credit losses related to investment securities could impact cash flow, tangible capital or liquidity. See Note 2 &#8212; Summary of Significant Account Policies and Note 5 &#8212; Investment Securities for further discussion on the application 

&#160; 

of ASU 2016-13 on the investment securities portfolio. 

&#8203; 

As securities held for investment are purchased, they are designated as held to maturity or available for sale based upon our intent, which incorporates liquidity needs, interest rate expectations, asset/liability management strategies, and capital requirements. Although securities classified as available for sale may be sold from time to time to meet liquidity or other needs, it is not our normal practice to trade this segment of the investment securities portfolio. While Management generally holds these assets on a long-term basis or until maturity, any short-term investments or securities available for sale could be converted at an earlier point, depending partly on changes in interest rates and alternative investment opportunities. 

Other Investments 

&#8203; 

Other investment securities include primarily our investments in FHLB and FRB stock with no readily determinable market value. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, Management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. As of September 30, 2022, we determined that there was no impairment on our other investment securities. As of September 30, 2022, other investment securities represented app rox imately $179.8 million, or 0.40% of total assets, and primarily consists of FHLB and FRB stock which totals $165.4 million, or 0.37% of total assets. There were no gains or losses on the sales of these securities for three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Trading Securities 

&#8203; 

We have a trading portfolio associated with our Correspondent Bank Division and the Bank&#8217;s subsidiary Duncan-Williams. This portfolio is carried at fair value and realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in trading securities revenue, a component of Correspondent Banking and Capital Market Income in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Securities purchased for this portfolio have primarily been municipal bonds, treasuries and mortgage-backed agency securities, which are held for short periods of time and totaled $51.9 million and $77.7 million, respectively, at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Loans Held for Sale 

&#8203; 

The balance of mortgage loans held for sale decreased $157.2 million from December 31, 2021 to $34.5 million at September 30, 2022. Total mortgage production remained strong at $1.1 billion during the third quarter of 2022, however, a significantly higher percentage of mortgage production was booked to portfolio instead of being sold into the secondary market, 78% for the third quarter of 2022 compared to 73% in the previous quarter and 46% during the fourth quarter of 2021. The secondary pipeline decreased to $76 million at September 30, 2022 compared to $254 million at December 31, 2021. The allocation of mortgage production between portfolio and secondary market depends on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate over time.

Total loans, net of deferred loan costs and fees (excluding mortgage loans held for sale), increased by $4.9 billion, or 27.4% annualized, to $28.8 billion at September 30, 2022. This increase included a $229.5 million decline in total PPP loans from December 31, 2021. Excluding the effects from PPP loans, total loans increased $5.1 billion, or 29.0% annualized in the first nine months of 2022. Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by $4.9 billion, or 40.6% annualized, driven by growth in all categories. Commercial non-owner occupied loans, consumer owner occupied loans, commercial and industrial loans, commercial owner occupied real estate and construction and land development loans led the way with $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion, $732.0 million, $451.8 million and $446.2 million in year-to-date loan growth, respectively, or 49.6%, 63.0%, 33.7%, 19.5% and 33.3% annualized growth, respectively. The non-acquired loan growth was offset by a $215.8 million decline in non-acquired PPP loans from December 31, 2021. The acquired loan portfolio increased by $32.3 million, or 0.5% annualized, due to the addition of $2.4 billion from the merger with Atlantic Capital, net of offsets from paydowns and payoffs in both the PCD and Non-PCD loan categories, along with renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The main categories that increased were commercial and industrial loans and construction and land development loans with $484.6 million and $75.2 million in year-to-date loan growth as most other categories of acquired loans declined. Acquired loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to 27.4% and non-acquired loans as a percentage of the overall portfolio increased to 72.6% at September 30, 2022. This compares to acquired loans as a percentage of total loans of 32.9% and non-acquired loans as a percentage of total loans of 67.1% at December 31, 2021. 

Allowance for Credit Losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects Management&#8217;s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. The Company established the incremental increase in the ACL at adoption through equity and 

&#160; 

subsequent adjustments through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings. The Company records loans charged off against the ACL and subsequent recoveries, if any, increase the ACL when they are recognized. Please see Note 2 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL. 

&#8203; 

As stated in Note 2 &#8211; Significant Accounting Policies under the caption Allowance for Credit Losses , Management uses systematic methodologies to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, Management&#8217;s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. The Company&#8217;s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects Management&#8217;s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for Management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses. The Company&#8217;s ACL is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans. 

&#8203; 

The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans with similar risk characteristics are grouped into homogenous segments, or pools, for analysis. The Discounted Cash Flow (&#8220;DCF&#8221;) method is used for each loan in a pool, and the results are aggregated at the pool level. A periodic tendency to default and absolute loss given default are applied to a projective model of the loan&#8217;s cash flow while considering prepayment and principal curtailment effects. The analysis produces expected cash flows for each instrument in the pool by pairing loan-level term information (e.g., maturity date, payment amount, interest rate, etc.) with top-down pool assumptions (e.g., default rates and prepayment speeds). The Company has identified the following portfolio segments: Owner-Occupied Commercial Real Estate, Non Owner-Occupied Commercial Real Estate, Multifamily, Municipal, Commercial and Industrial, Commercial Construction and Land Development, Residential Construction, Residential Senior Mortgage, Residential Junior Mortgage, Revolving Mortgage, and Consumer and Other. 

&#8203; 

In determining the proper level of the ACL, Management has determined that the loss experience of the Bank provides the best basis for its assessment of expected credit losses. The Company therefore used its own historical credit loss experience by each loan segment over an economic cycle, while excluding loss experience from certain acquired institutions (i.e., failed banks). For most of the segment models for collectively evaluated loans, the Company incorporated two or more macroeconomic drivers using a statistical regression modeling methodology. 

&#8203; 

Management considers forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses. The Company subscribes to a third-party service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the United States economy. The baseline, along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios, is used by Management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and takes into consideration the scenarios in relation to actual economic and other data, such as gross domestic product growth, monetary and fiscal policy, inflation, supply chain issues and global events like the Russian/Ukraine conflict, as well as the volatility and magnitude of changes within those scenarios quarter over quarter, and consideration of conditions within the bank&#8217;s operating environment and geographic area. Additional forecast scenarios may be weighted along with the baseline forecast to arrive at the final reserve estimate. While periods of relative economic stability should generally lead to stability in forecast scenarios and weightings to estimate credit losses, periods of instability can likewise require Management to adjust the selection of scenarios and weightings, in accordance with the accounting standards. For the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straight-line approach. The Company generally uses a four-quarter forecast and a four-quarter reversion period. 

&#8203; 

The Russian invasion of Ukraine, global supply chain, energy and commodity issues, and persistent elevated levels of inflation have increased volatility and uncertainties within the economy and economic forecasts. It is widely acknowledged that the chances of recession have increased over the last two quarters. Accordingly, Management continues to use a blended forecast scenario of the baseline and more severe scenario, depending on the circumstances and economic outlook. As of September 30, 2022, Management selected a baseline weighting of 60%, up from 40% in the second quarter of 2022, and decreased the more severe scenario to 40%, down from 60% in the previous quarter. The change in weighting from the second to third quarter is more reflective of changes in the baseline forecast than of a 

&#160; 

material change in Management&#8217;s outlook, which has remained consistent with prior quarters. Specifically, Management observed the September baseline scenario captured more appropriately the growing recessionary risks first considered by Management in the prior quarter. While employment figures show resilience, the downward shifts in commercial real estate price index and national house price index and GDP were more closely aligned with current economic conditions observed by Management. The resulting provision was approximately $23.9 million during the third quarter of 2022, including the provision for unfunded commitments. 

&#8203; 

Included in its systematic methodology to determine its ACL, Management considers the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. These qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation (i.e., formulaic model results). Each period the Company considers qualitative factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework that includes the following: (1) lending policy; (2) economic conditions not captured in models; (3) volume and mix of loan portfolio; (4) past due trends; (5) concentration risk; (6) external factors; and (7) model limitations. During the third quarter of 2022, we included a $1.9 million qualitative adjustment for model limitations pertaining to the PCD loan portfolio acquired through the Atlantic Capital merger. In the prior quarter, we made a qualitative adjustment of $42.2 million, or 15 basis points, for economic conditions based on an analysis that forecasts of commercial real estate indices and the unemployment rate did not fully reflect the risks of recession. However, with the downward shifts observed during the third quarter of 2022 in the baseline and more adverse forecast scenarios, Management determined the shifts in the weighting of the scenarios sufficiently captured the expected credit losses of the loan portfolio; therefore, a qualitative adjustment for economic conditions was no longer necessary for the current period end. 

&#8203; 

When a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with its segment, the asset is assessed to determine whether it should be included in another pool or should be individually evaluated. The Company&#8217;s threshold for individually evaluated loans includes all non-accrual loans with a net book balance in excess of $1.0 million. Management will monitor the credit environment and make adjustments to this threshold in the future if warranted. Based on the threshold above, consumer financial assets will generally remain in pools unless they meet the dollar threshold. The expected credit losses on individually evaluated loans will be estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis unless the loan meets the criteria for use of the fair value of collateral, either by virtue of an expected foreclosure or through meeting the definition of collateral-dependent. Financial assets that have been individually evaluated can be returned to a pool for purposes of estimating the expected credit loss insofar as their credit profile improves and the repayment terms were not considered to be unique to the asset. 

&#8203; 

Management measures expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan. When determining the contractual term, the Company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions, renewals, or modifications, unless the Company reasonably expects it will execute a troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;) with a borrower. In the event of a reasonably expected TDR, the Company factors the reasonably-expected TDR into the current expected credit losses estimate. For consumer loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the borrower&#8217;s application for a modification (i.e., the borrower qualifies for the TDR) or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. For commercial loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the loan for modification or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. The Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology for a TDR to calculate the effect of the concession provided to the borrower within the ACL. The Company has not chosen to early adopt the retirement of TDR guidance, which will be adopted effective January 1, 2023. 

&#8203; 

A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, the Company implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. The Company&#8217;s payment relief assistance includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to not apply TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if the concession met the criteria as defined under the CARES Act. 

&#8203; 

For purchased credit-deteriorated, otherwise referred to herein as PCD, assets are defined as acquired individual financial assets (or acquired groups of financial assets with similar risk characteristics) that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Company&#8217;s assessment. The Company records acquired PCD loans by adding the expected credit losses (i.e., allowance 

&#160; 

for credit losses) to the purchase price of the financial assets rather than recording through the provision for credit losses in the income statement. The expected credit loss, as of the acquisition day, of a PCD loan is added to the allowance for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is the difference between the unpaid principal balance and the amortized cost basis as of the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the change in the ACL on PCD loans is recognized through the provision for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is accreted or amortized, respectively, into interest income over the remaining life of the PCD loan on a level-yield basis. In accordance with the transition requirements within the standard, the Company&#8217;s acquired credit-impaired loans (i.e., ACI or Purchased Credit Impaired) were treated as PCD loans. As a result of the merger with Atlantic Capital, the Company identified approximately $137.9 million of loans as PCD and recorded an allowance for credit losses of $13.8 million on acquisition date. 

&#8203; 

Atlantic Capital was acquired and merged with and into the Bank on March 1, 2022, requiring that a closing date ACL be prepared for Atlantic Capital on a standalone basis and that the acquired portfolio be included in the Bank&#8217;s first quarter ACL. Atlantic Capital&#8217;s loans represented approximately 8% of the total Bank&#8217;s portfolio at March 31, 2022. Given the relative size and complexity of the acquired portfolio, similarities of the loan characteristics, and similar loss history to the existing portfolio, reserve calculations were performed using the Bank&#39;s existing CECL model, loan segmentation, and forecast weighting as the first quarter end reserve. The acquisition date ACL totaled $27.5 million, consisting of a non-PCD pooled reserve of $13.7 million, PCD pooled reserve of $5.7 million, and PCD individually evaluated reserve of $8.1 million. It represented about 8% of the combined Bank&#8217;s ACL reserve at March 31, 2022. The acquisition date reserve for unfunded commitments totaled $3.4 million, or 11% of the combined Bank&#8217;s total at March 31, 2022. 

&#8203; 

The Company follows its nonaccrual policy by reversing contractual interest income in the income statement when the Company places a loan on nonaccrual status. Therefore, Management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on the portfolio and does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. As of September 30, 2022, the accrued interest receivable for loans recorded in Other Assets was $93.7 million. 

&#8203; 

The Company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an off-balance sheet exposure. These primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit. The expected losses associated with these exposures within the unfunded portion of the expected credit loss will be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. Management has determined that a majority of the Company&#8217;s off-balance-sheet credit exposures are not unconditionally cancellable. Management completes funding studies based on historical data to estimate the percentage of unfunded loan commitments that will ultimately be funded to calculate the reserve for unfunded commitments. Management applies this funding rate, along with the loss factor rate determined for each pooled loan segment, to unfunded loan commitments, excluding unconditionally cancellable exposures and letters of credit, to arrive at the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. As of September 30, 2022, the liability recorded for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments was $53.0 million. The current adjustment to the ACL for unfunded commitments is recognized through the Provision for Credit Losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

&#8203; 

As of September 30, 2022, the balance of the ACL was $324.4 million or 1.12% of total loans. The ACL increased $4.7 million from the balance of $319.7 million recorded at June 30, 2022. This increase during the third quarter of 2022 included $3.4 million of provision for credit losses, in addition to $1.3 million in net recoveries. During the first nine months of 2022, the Company released $1.5 million of its allowance for credit losses along with net charge-offs of $3.4 million. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses based on loan growth and adjusted the weighting of the baseline and more severe forecast scenarios in our modeling to adequately capture growing economic recessionary risks. 

&#8203; 

At September 30, 2022, the Company had a reserve on unfunded commitments of $53.0 million, which was recorded as a liability on the Balance Sheet, compared to $32.5 million at June 30, 2022 and $30.5 million at December 31, 2021. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments of $20.5 million and $22.5 million, respectively. The year-to-date provision of $22.5 million includes the initial provision for credit losses for unfunded commitments acquired from Atlantic Capital, which the Company recorded during the first quarter of 2022 . The provision for credit losses is based on the growth in unfunded loan commitments and the adjustment in the weighting of the baseline and more severe forecast scenarios in our modeling to adequately capture growing economic recessionary risks. This amount was recorded in Provision (Recovery) for Credit Losses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company did not have an 

&#160; 

allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financials asset during the first nine months of 2022. 

&#8203; 

At September 30, 2022, the allowance for credit losses was $324.4 million, or 1.12%, of period-end loans. The ACL provides 3.24 times coverage of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2022. Net recoveries and net charge-offs to total average loans during three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were (0.02)% and 0.02%, respectively. We continued to show solid and stable asset quality numbers and ratios as of September 30, 2022. 

The following table provides the allocation, by segment, for expected credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 .Because PPP loans are government guaranteed and Management implemented additional reviews and procedures to help mitigate potential losses, Management does not expect to recognize credit losses on this loan portfolio and as a result, did not record an ACL for PPP loans within the C&#38;I loan segment presented in the table below.

(1) Consists of real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure. 

&#160; 

(2) Consists of non-real estate foreclosed assets, such as repossessed vehicles. (3) Includes nonaccrual loans that are purchase credit deteriorated (PCD loans). (4) Loan data excludes mortgage loans held for sale. (5) For purposes of this calculation, total assets include all assets (both acquired and non-acquired). (6) Excludes non-acquired bank premises held for sale of $21.2 million, $1.4 million, $893,000, $1.0 million and $1.0 million as of September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021, respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet. (7) Excludes acquired bank premises held for sale of $3.9 million, $4.2 million, $5.5 million, $8.6 million and $14.1 million as of September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021, respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet. Total nonperforming assets were $102.4 million, or 0.35% of total loans and repossessed assets, at September 30, 2022, an increase of $18.6 million, or 22.3%, from December 31, 2021. Total nonperforming loans were $100.0 million, or 0.35%, of total loans, at September 30, 2022, an increase of $19.7 million, or 24.6%, from December 31, 2021. Non-acquired nonperforming loans increased by $13.4 million from December 31, 2021. The increase in non-acquired nonperforming loans was driven primarily by an increase in commercial nonaccrual loans of $12.0 million, an increase in restructured nonaccrual loans of $3.8 million, offset by a decrease in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $2.3 million. The increase in commercial nonaccrual loans at September 30, 2022 was primarily due to one commercial owner occupied loan totaling $11.1 million. Acquired nonperforming loans increased $6.3 million from December 31, 2021. The increase in the acquired nonperforming loan balances was due to an increase in commercial nonaccruing loans of $6.5 million, an increase in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $1.2 million, offset by a decrease in consumer nonaccruing loans of $1.4 million. 

At September 30, 2022, OREO totaled $2.2 million, which included $58,000 in non-acquired OREO and $2.1 million in acquired OREO. Total OREO decreased $324,000 million from December 31, 2021. At September 30, 2022, non-acquired OREO consisted of two properties with an average value of $29,000. This compared to one property with an average value of $252,000 at December 31, 2021. In the third quarter of 2022, we added two new properties into non-acquired OREO, while there were no sales during the period. At September 30, 2022, acquired OREO consisted of ten properties with an average value of $210,200, compared to eleven properties with an average value of $226,000 at December 31, 2021. In the third quarter of 2022, two new properties were transferred to acquired OREO, while selling one property with no aggregate value. 

Potential Problem Loans 

&#8203; 

Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming loans, related to non-acquired loans were approximately $19.5 million, or 0.09%, of total non-acquired loans outstanding, at September 30, 2022, compared to $6.9 million, or 0.04%, of total non-acquired loans outstanding, at December 31, 2021. Potential problem loans related to acquired loans totaled $23.8 million, or 0.30%, of total acquired loans outstanding, at September 30, 2022, compared to $19.3 million, or 0.24% of total acquired loans outstanding, at December 31, 2021. All potential problem loans represent those loans where information about possible credit problems of the borrowers has caused Management to have concern about the borrower&#8217;s ability to comply with present repayment terms. 

Interest-Bearing Liabilities 

&#8203; 

Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits, CDs, other time deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include NOW, HSA, IOLTA, and Market Rate checking accounts. 

&#8203; 

Total interest-bearing deposits increased $449.8 million or 2.6% annualized to $24.0 billion at September 30, 2022 from $23.6 billion at December 31, 2021. This increase was driven by interest-bearing deposits assumed from Atlantic Capital of $1.1 billion (balance of deposits at September 30, 2022). During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, core deposits increased $724.2 million, excluding the balance of core deposits assumed in the Atlantic Capital transaction during the first quarter of 2022. These funds exclude certificates of deposits and other time deposits and are normally lower cost funds. Federal funds purchased related to the Correspondent Bank division and repurchase agreements were $557.8 million at September 30, 2022, down $223.4 million from December 31, 2021. Corporate and subordinated debentures increased by $65.3 million to $392.4 million. Some key highlights are outlined below: 

&#9679; The increase in interest-bearing deposits from December 31, 2021 was driven by an increase in interest-bearing transactional accounts including money markets of $472.1 million, and savings of $252.0 million, partially offset by a decline in time deposits of $274.4 million. Excluding deposits held by legacy Atlantic Capital as of September 30, 2022, interest-bearing deposits declined $664.3 million. Interest-bearing transactional accounts, 

&#160; 

including money market accounts, decreased $335.7 million, savings increased $250.9 million, and time deposits decreased $579.5 million. Deposits declined during the third quarter of 2022 due mainly to the timing of ACH payments for the payroll business which resulted in a temporary decline of $457 million at the end of the quarter. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $1.8 billion to $24.1 billion compared to the same period in 2021. &#9679; Corporate and subordinated debentures increased $65.3 million from the period end balance at December 31, 2021. The increase was due to the assumption of $78.4 million in subordinated debt resulting from the Atlantic Capital transaction completed during the first quarter of 2022, which was partially offset by the redemption of $13.0 million of subordinated debt on June 30, 2022. Noninterest-Bearing Deposits 

&#8203; 

Noninterest-bearing deposits are transaction accounts that provide our Bank with &#8220;interest-free&#8221; sources of funds. At September 30, 2022, the period end balance of noninterest-bearing deposits was $13.7 billion, exceeding the December 31, 2021 balance by $2.2 billion. The increase was mainly due to the noninterest-bearing deposits assumed from the merger with Atlantic Capital in March 2022 along with organic growth. The acquisition date noninterest-bearing deposits balances assumed from Atlantic Capital totaled $1.4 billion and approximately $1.4 billion at September 30, 2022. Average noninterest-bearing deposits were $13.9 billion for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $11.3 billion for the third quarter of 2021. This increase was related to both organic growth and deposits assumed through the Atlantic Capital transaction. 

Capital Resources 

&#8203; 

Our ongoing capital requirements have been met primarily through retained earnings, less the payment of cash dividends. As of September 30, 2022, shareholders&#8217; equity was $4.9 billion, an increase of $118.2 million, or 2.5%, from December 31, 2021.

In January 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the authorization of a 3,500,000 share Company stock repurchase plan (the &#8220;2021 Stock Repurchase Plan&#8221;). During 2021 and through September 30, 2022, we repurchased 3,129,979 shares, at an average price of $81.97 per share (excluding cost of commissions) for a total of $256.6 million. Of this amount, we repurchased 1,312,038 shares, at an average price of $83.99 per share (excluding cost of commissions) for a total of $110.2 million during 2022. The Company did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter of 2022. 

On June 7, 2022, the Company received Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s supervisory nonobjection on the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program, which was previously approved by the Board of Directors of the Company on April 27, 2022, contingent upon receipt of such supervisory nonobjection. The 2022 Stock Repurchase Program authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 3.75 million shares, or up to approximately 5 percent, of the Company&#8217;s outstanding shares of common stock as of March 31, 2022. Our Board of Directors approved the program after considering, among other things, our liquidity needs and capital resources as well as the estimated current value of our net assets. The aggregate number of shares of common stocks authorized to be repurchased totals 4.12 million shares, which includes 370,021 shares remaining from the Company&#8217;s 2021 Stock Repurchase Plan.

&#160; 

the timing of the purchases are based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of our common stock, and the availability of alternative investment opportunities. 

&#8203; 

We are subject to regulations with respect to certain risk-based capital ratios. These risk-based capital ratios measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks. The values of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are adjusted based on the rules to reflect categorical credit risk. In addition to the risk-based capital ratios, the regulatory agencies have also established a leverage ratio for assessing capital adequacy. The leverage ratio is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by total consolidated on-balance sheet assets (minus amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital). The leverage ratio does not involve assigning risk weights to assets. 

&#8203; 

Specifically, we are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios:

&#8203; 

&#9679; a CET1, risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; &#9679; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; &#9679; a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and &#9679; a leverage ratio of 4%. 

Under the current capital rules, Tier 1 capital includes two components: CET1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The highest form of capital, CET1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, otherwise referred to as AOCI, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and Tier 1 minority interests. Tier 2 capital generally includes the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying preferred stock, subordinated debt, trust preferred securities and qualifying tier 2 minority interests, less any deductions in Tier 2 instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution. AOCI is presumptively included in CET1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. When the current capital rules were first implemented, the Bank exercised its one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI, allowing us to retain our pre-existing treatment for AOCI. 

In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a banking organization must maintain a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three risk-based measurements (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital), resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. 

The Bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized) and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three risk-based regulatory capital ratios (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital) and for the leverage ratio.

&#8203; 

The federal banking agencies revised their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the implementation of CECL&#894; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the adoption date adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL&#894; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing. CECL became effective for us on January 1, 2020 and the Company applied the provisions of the standard using the modified retrospective method as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. Related to the implementation of ASU 2016-13, we recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of $54.4 million, deferred tax assets of $12.6 million, an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of $6.4 million and an adjustment to retained earnings of $44.8 million. Instead of recognizing the effects on regulatory capital from ASU 2016-13 at adoption, the Company initially elected the option for recognizing the adoption date effects on the Company&#8217;s regulatory capital calculations over a three-year phase-in .

&#8203; 

In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations that adopt CECL in the 2020 calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of 

&#160; 

CECL on regulatory capital, followed by the aforementioned three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of benefit during the initial two-year delay for a total five-year transition. The estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital (modified CECL transitional amount) is calculated as the sum of the adoption date impact on retained earnings upon adoption of CECL (CECL transitional amount) and the calculated change in the ACL relative to the adoption date ACL upon adoption of CECL multiplied by a scaling factor of 25%. The scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the ACL under CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology. The Company chose the five-year transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from the adoption date and the CECL difference for the first two years of application. The modified CECL transitional amount was calculated each quarter for the first two years of the five-year transition. The amount of the modified CECL transition amount was fixed as of December 31, 2021, and that amount is subject to the three-year phase out, which began in the first quarter of 2022.

The Company&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios decreased compared to December 31, 2021. These ratios decreased due to the additional risk-weighted assets acquired through the acquisition of Atlantic Capital in the first quarter of 2022, which on average, had a higher risk weighting, the reduction in cash and cash equivalents during the quarter, which are lower risk weighted assets, and due to the organic growth in loans during 2022, which have a higher risk weighting. The effects on our ratios from the increase in risk-weighted assets were partially offset by an increase in Tier 1 and total risk-based capital due to net income recognized in 2022, the addition to the net equity of $658.8 million issued for the Atlantic Capital acquisition and the $75.0 million in subordinated debt, also assumed from Atlantic Capital, that qualifies as total risk-based capital. These increases in capital were partially offset by the $119.3 million of stock repurchases completed during 2022, including shares withheld for taxes pertaining to the vesting of equity awards, along with the dividend paid to shareholders of $108.6 million and the redemption of $13 million of subordinated debentures on June 30, 2022. The Tier 1 leverage ratios for both the Company and Bank increased slightly compared to December 31, 2021, as the percentage increase in Tier 1 capital was greater than the percentage increase in average assets during 2022. Our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory classification. 

Liquidity 

&#8203; 

Liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations, which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits, extension of credit and payment of operating expenses. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank&#8217;s financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet its obligations. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring policies designed to ensure acceptable composition of our asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. We have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs. 

&#8203; 

Asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans, investment securities and other short-term investments. Management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and investments. Normally, changes in the earning asset mix are of a longer-term nature and are not used for day-to-day corporate liquidity needs. 

&#160; 

&#8203; 

Our liabilities provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, interest-bearing deposits at other banks and other short-term borrowings. We engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our Bank; &#9679; Pricing deposits, including certificates of deposit, at rate levels that will attract and /or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our Bank&#8217;s asset/liability management and net interest margin requirements; and &#9679; Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our Bank&#8217;s appeal as a primary provider of financial services. Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by approximately $4.9 billion, or approximately 40.6% annualized, compared to the balance at December 31, 2021. The increase from December 31, 2021 was mainly related to organic growth and renewals on acquired loans. The acquired loan portfolio increased by $32.3 million from the balance at December 31, 2021 through the addition of $2.4 billion in loans acquired in the Atlantic Capital transaction on March 1, 2022. This increase was partially offset through principal paydowns, charge-offs, foreclosures, and renewals of acquired loans. 

Our investment securities portfolio (excluding trading securities) increased $1.1 billion compared to the balance at December 31, 2021. The increase in investment securities from December 31, 2021 was a result of purchases of $2.5 billion, along with $703.7 million in investment securities acquired in the Atlantic Capital transaction. This increase was partially offset by maturities, calls, sales and paydowns of investment securities totaling $1.1 billion, as well as decrease in the market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio of $922.5 million. N et amortization of premiums was $21.5 million in the first nine months of 2022. The increase in investment securities was due to the Company making the strategic decision to increase the size of the portfolio with the excess funds from deposit growth. Total cash and cash equivalents were $2.8 billion at September 30, 2022 as compared to $6.8 billion at December 31, 2021 as funds were used to fund loan growth and purchase securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

&#8203; 

At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had $150.1 million and $325.0 million of traditional, out&#8211;of-market brokered deposits. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had $826.5 million and $900.1 million, respectively, of reciprocal brokered deposits. Total deposits were $37.7 billion at September 30, 2022, an increase of $2.6 billion from $35.1 billion at December 31, 2021 . This increase was mainly due to the $3.0 billion in deposits assumed in the Atlantic Capital transaction on March 1, 2022. Our deposit growth since December 31, 2021 included an increase in demand deposit accounts of $2.2 billion, as well as an increase in savings and money market accounts of $1.0 billion, partially offset by a decline in interest-bearing transaction accounts of $277.5 million and time deposits of $274.4 million. Total borrowings at September 30, 2022 were $392.4 million and consisted of trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures, which includes $78.5 million of subordinated debt assumed from Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022 . Total short-term borrowings at September 30, 2022 were $557.8 million, consisting of $213.8 million in federal funds purchased and $344.0 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. To the extent that we employ other types of non-deposit funding sources, typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers, we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds. Our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise. 

&#8203; 

Through the operations of our Bank, we have made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities. These commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to our customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time. We manage the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes. We believe that we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund commitments that are drawn upon by the borrowers. In addition to commitments to extend credit, we also issue standby letters of credit, which are assurances to third parties that they will not suffer a loss if our customer fails to meet its contractual obligation to the third-party. Although our experience indicates that many of these standby letters of credit will expire unused, through our various sources of liquidity, we believe that we will have the necessary resources to meet these obligations should the need arise. 

&#8203; 

Our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position, as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets, typically including some level of reverse repurchase agreements, federal funds sold, balances at the 

&#160; 

Federal Reserve Bank, and/or other short-term investments; asset quality; well-capitalized position; and profitable operating results. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our desired liquidity position at any time. We expect that these conditions would generally be of a short-term nature. Under such circumstances, we expect our reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds sold positions, or balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, if any, to serve as the primary source of immediate liquidity. At September 30, 2022, our Bank had total federal funds credit lines of $300.0 million with no balance outstanding. If we needed additional liquidity, we would turn to short-term borrowings as an alternative immediate funding source and would consider other appropriate actions such as promotions to increase core deposits or the use of the brokered deposit markets. At September 30, 2022, our Bank had $839.2 million of credit available at the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s Discount Window and had no balance outstanding. In addition, we could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks and/or the FHLB. At September 30, 2022, our Bank had a total FHLB credit facility of $3.4 billion with total outstanding FHLB letters of credit consuming $1.6 million leaving $3.4 billion in availability on the FHLB credit facility. The holding company has a $100.0 million unsecured line of credit with U.S. Bank National Association with no balance outstanding at September 30, 2022. We believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available. 

Our contingency funding plan describes several po tential stages based on stressed liquidity levels. Liquidity key risk indicators are reported to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. We maintain various wholesale sources of funding. If our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful, we would use these alternative sources of funding. Under such circumstances, depending on the external source of funds, our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates charged. This could increase our cost of funds, impacting our net interest margin and net interest spread. 

Asset-Liability Management and Market Risk Sensitivity 

&#8203; 

Our earnings and the economic value of equity vary in relation to the behavior of interest rates and the accompanying fluctuations in market prices of certain of our financial instruments. We define interest rate risk as the risk to earnings and equity arising from the behavior of interest rates. These behaviors include increases and decreases in interest rates as well as continuation of the current interest rate environment. 

&#8203; 

Our interest rate risk principally consists of reprice, option, basis, and yield curve risk. Reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing characteristics of asset and liability portfolios. Option risk arises from embedded options in the investment and loan portfolios such as investment securities calls and loan prepayment options. Option risk also exists since deposit customers may withdraw funds at their discretion in response to general market conditions, competitive alternatives to existing accounts or other factors. The exercise of such options may result in higher costs or lower revenue. Basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices, which subsequently result in narrowing spreads on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Basis risk also exists in administered rate liabilities, such as interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts where the price sensitivity of such products may vary relative to general markets rates. Yield curve risk refers to adverse consequences of nonparallel shifts in the yield curves of various market indices that impact our assets and liabilities. 

&#8203; 

We use simulation analysis as a primary method to assess earnings at risk and equity at risk due to assumed changes in interest rates. Management uses the results of its various simulation analyses in combination with other data and observations to formulate strategies designed to maintain interest rate risk within risk tolerances. 

&#8203; 

Simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including, but not limited to, the timing of cash flows such as the terms of contractual agreements, investment security calls, loan prepayment speeds, deposit attrition rates, the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates, and the behavior of interest rates and spreads. Equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows. Simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes. Key simulation assumptions are subject to sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk. Model assumptions are reviewed by our Assumptions Committee. 

&#8203; 

Earnings at risk is defined as the percentage change in net interest income due to assumed changes in interest rates. Earnings at risk is generally used to assess interest rate risk over relatively short time horizons. 

&#8203; 

Equity at risk is defined as the percentage change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to 

&#160; 

changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value. The discounted present value of all cash flows represents our economic value of equity. Equity at risk is generally considered a measure of the long-term interest rate exposures of the balance sheet at a point in time. 

&#8203; 

The earnings simulation models take into account our contractual agreements with regard to investments, loans, deposits, borrowings, and derivatives as well as a number of behavioral assumptions applied to certain assets and liabilities. 

&#8203; 

Mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist of forward sales contracts and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans. These derivatives involve underlying items, such as interest rates, and are designed to mitigate risk. Derivatives are also used to hedge mortgage servicing rights. 

&#8203; 

From time to time, we execute interest rate swaps to hedge some of our interest rate risks. Under these arrangements, the Company enters into a variable rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement. The swap agreement effectively converts the client&#8217;s variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan. The Company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a third-party dealer to offset its exposure on the customer swap. The Company may also execute interest rate swap agreements that are not specific to client loans. As of the reporting date, the Company did not have such agreements. 

&#8203; 

Our interest rate risk key indicators are applied to a static balance sheet using forward rates from the Moody&#8217;s Baseline Scenario. The Company will also use other rate forecasts, including, but not limited to, Moody&#8217;s Consensus Scenario. This Base Case Scenario assumes the maturity composition of asset and liability rollover volumes is modeled to approximately replicate current consolidated balance sheet characteristics throughout the simulation. These treatments are consistent with the Company&#8217;s goal of assessing current interest rate risk embedded in its current balance sheet. The Base Case Scenario assumes that maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at prices referencing forward rates derived from the selected rate forecast consistent with current balance sheet pricing characteristics. Key rate drivers are used to price assets and liabilities with sensitivity assumptions used to price non-maturity deposits. The sensitivity assumptions for the pricing of non-maturity deposits are subjected to sensitivity analysis no less frequently than on an annual basis. 

&#8203; 

Interest rate shocks are applied to the Base Case on an instantaneous basis. The range of interest rate shocks will include upward and downward movements of rates through 400 basis points in 100 basis point increments. At times, market conditions may result in assumed rate movements that will be deemphasized. For example, during a period of ultra-low interest rates, certain downward rate shocks may be impractical. The model simulation results produced from the Base Case Scenario and related instantaneous shocks for changes in net interest income and instantaneous rate shocks for changes in the economic value of equity are referred to as the Core Scenario Analysis and constitute the policy key risk indicators for interest rate risk when compared to risk tolerances. 

Relative to prior modeling and disclosures, Management revised its deposit beta assumptions higher due to the rapid increase in interest rates and expected further increases. Previous beta assumptions reflected sensitivities across full interest rate cycles. The beta assumptions were revised during the second quarter of 2022 to recognize that interest rates have risen while the Company&#8217;s cost of deposits have increased slightly. During the third quarter of 2022, the federal funds target rate increased 150 basis points while the Company&#8217;s total deposit cost increased 5 basis points. The revised beta assumptions reflect the acceleration of deposit cost increa ses associated with the expected increase in short term rates after September 30, 2022. These beta assumptions, when combined with the minimal increase in deposit costs since the federal funds rate began to rise in March 2022, reflect Management&#8217;s estimates across the entire current rising rate cycle. 

&#8203; 

The following interest rate risk metrics are derived from analysis using the Moody&#8217;s Consensus Scenario published in October 2022 as the Base Case. The consensus forecast projects an inverted yield curve. As of September 30, 2022, the earnin gs simulations indicated that the year 1 impact of an instantaneous 100 basis point increase / decrease in rates would result in an estimated 2.5% increase (up 100) and 4.1% decrease (down 100) in net interest income. 

&#8203; 

We use Economic Value of Equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) analysis as an indicator of the extent to which the present value of our capital could change, given potential changes in interest rates. This measure also assumes a static balance sheet (Base Case Scenario) with rate shocks applied as described above. At September 30, 2022, the percentage change in 

&#160; 

EVE due to a 100-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates was 0.6% decrease and 3.1% decrease, respectively. The percentage changes in EVE due to a 200-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates were 1.7% decrease and 7.7% decrease, respectively. The interest rate shock analysis results for EVE sensitivities are unusual as the benefits of repricing assets are mitigated by increasing deposit costs. Downward shocks are constrained on various balance sheet categories due to the inability to price products below floors or zero. This is particularly meaningful given the cost of deposits as of September 30, 2022. 

The analysis below reflects a Base Case and shocked scenarios that assume a static balance sheet projection where volume is added to maintain balances consistent with current levels, except for PPP loans that are not assumed to be replaced. Base Case assumes new and repricing volumes reference forward rates derived from the Moody&#8217;s Consensus rate forecast. Instantaneous, parallel, and sustained interest rate shocks are applied to the Base Case scenario over a one-year time horizon.

LIBOR Transition 

&#8203; 

In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in the United Kingdom, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intended to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR at the end of 2021. On March 5, 2021, the FCA confirmed that all LIBOR settings would either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021 for the one-week and two-month US dollar settings and immediately after June 30, 2023 for all remaining US dollar settings. 

&#8203; 

The Alternative Reference Rates Committee proposed Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) as its preferred rate as an alternative to LIBOR and proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR. Organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. As noted within Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 2021, we hold instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR including floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and hedges, and other financial instruments but is not able to currently predict the associated financial impact of the transition to an alternative reference rate. 

&#8203; 

We have established a cross-functional LIBOR transition working group that has (1) assessed the Company&#39;s current exposure to LIBOR indexed instruments and the data, systems and processes that will be impacted; (2) established a detailed implementation plan; and (3) developed a formal governance structure for the transition. The Company has developed and continues to implement various proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of customers, which include: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; The adoption and ongoing implementation of fallback provisions that provide for the determination of replacement rates for LIBOR-linked financial products. &#9679; The adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, consistent with guidance provided by the U.S. regulators, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, and GSEs. &#9679; The selection of SOFR indices as the replacement indices, and successful completion of systems testing using the SOFR replacement indices. &#8203; 

The Company discontinued quoting LIBOR on September 30, 2021 and discontinued originating new products linked to LIBOR on December 31, 2021.

&#8203; 

We intend to use the provisions of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act passed by Congress and signed in to law by the President in March 2022 for certain contracts referencing LIBOR. The Act provides for the use of SOFR as the replacement index with a spread adjustment when the remaining LIBOR indices are discontinued. The Act applies when there is no contract provision addressing the loss of LIBOR and may be used otherwise as well, provided the contract does not provide for a specific replacement index. This aligns with the plan of action currently under implementation by the Company. 

&#160; 

&#8203; 

The Company continues to evaluate its financial and operational infrastructure in its effort to transition all financial and strategic processes, systems, and models to reference rates other than LIBOR. The Company is in the process of developing and implementing processes to educate client-facing associates and coordinate communications with customers regarding the transition. 

&#8203; 

As of September 30, 2022, the Company had the following exposures to LIBOR: 

&#9679; Approximately $5.4 billion of total outstanding loans referencing LIBOR. Of this amount, $5.1 billion have maturities occurring after the LIBOR discontinuation date of June 30, 2023. &#9679; Approximately $17.4 billion in interest rate swaps that are indexed to LIBOR with a gross positive fair value of $141.4 million and a gross negative fair value of $141.4 million. However, the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. Therefore, the transition to LIBOR will have no hedge accounting impact as changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. Moreover, the exposure of both sides of these swaps is presented in these figures. These exposures are intended to offset each other. &#9679; Trust preferred securities that reference LIBOR and had a total principal balance of $118.6 million. These securities have maturities ranging from October 7, 2033 through March 14, 2037. Deposit and Loan Concentrations 

&#8203; 

We have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers. We have no significant portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries. Furthermore, we attempt to avoid making loans that, in an aggregate amount, exceed 10% of total loans to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities. As of September 30, 2022, there were no aggregated loan concentrations of this type. We do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us. We do not have any foreign loans or deposits. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

&#8203; 

We consider concentrations of credit to exist when, pursuant to regulatory guidelines, the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents 25% of total Tier 1 capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses of the Company, or $986.4 million at September 30, 2022. Based on this criteria, we had six such credit concentrations at September 30, 2022, including loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings (except mini-warehouses) of $5.6 billion, loans secured by owner occupied office buildings (including medical office buildings) of $1.9 billion, loans secured by owner occupied nonresidential buildings (excluding office buildings) of $1.7 billion, loans to lessors of residential buildings (investment properties and multi-family) of $1.6 billion, loans secured by 1st mortgage 1-4 family owner occupied residential property (including condos and home equity lines) of $5.1 billion and loans secured by jumbo (original loans greater than $548,250) 1st mortgage 1-4 family owner occupied residential property of $2.1 billion. The risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time. The loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard ACL methodology. 

With some financial institutions adopting CECL in the first quarter of 2020, banking regulators established new guidelines for calculating credit concentrations. Banking regulators set the guidelines for construction, land development and other land loans to total less than 100% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CDL concentration ratio) and for total commercial real estate loans (construction, land development and other land loans along with other non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans) to total less than 300% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CRE concentration ratio). Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank&#8217;s total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Bank&#8217;s CDL concentration ratio was 59.7% and 55.2%, respectively, and its CRE concentration ratio was 247.9% and 238.5%, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, the Bank was below the established regulatory guidelines. When a bank&#8217;s ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines, banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank Management. Therefore, we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes.

R econciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP 

&#8203; 

The return on average tangible equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the effect of the average balance of intangible assets and adds back the after-tax amortization of intangibles to GAAP basis net income. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information that is useful to investors in evaluating our performance and capital and may facilitate comparisons with other institutions in the banking industry as well as period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider the Company&#8217;s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, are not audited, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled financial measures used by other companies. Investors should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company&#8217;s results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.
