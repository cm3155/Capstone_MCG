References to the &#8220;Bank&#8221; means SouthState Corporation&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, SouthState Bank, National Association, a national banking association. 

Overview 

&#8203; 

SouthState Corporation is a financial holding company headquartered in Winter Haven, Florida, and was incorporated under the laws of South Carolina in 1985. We provide a wide range of banking services and products to our customers through our Bank. The Bank operates SouthState Advisory, Inc., a wholly owned registered investment advisor. The Bank also operates Duncan-Williams, Inc. (&#8220;Duncan-Williams&#8221;), which it acquired on February 1, 2021. Duncan-Williams is a registered broker-dealer, headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, that serves primarily institutional clients across the U.S. in the fixed income business. The Bank also owns CBI Holding Company, LLC (&#8220;CBI&#8221;), which in turn owns Corporate Billing, LLC (&#8220;Corporate Billing&#8221;), a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies, automotive parts and service providers nationwide. The holding company owns SSB Insurance Corp., a captive insurance subsidiary pursuant to Section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code. 

&#8203; 

At March 31, 2022, we had approximately $46.2 billion in assets and 5,182 full-time equivalent employees. Through our Bank branches, ATMs and online banking platforms, we provide our customers with a wide range of financial products and services, through a six (6) state footprint in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. These financial products and services include deposit accounts such as checking accounts, savings and time deposits of various types, safe deposit boxes, bank money orders, wire transfer and ACH services, brokerage services and alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds, trust and asset management services, loans of all types, including business loans, agriculture loans, real estate-secured (mortgage) loans, personal use loans, home improvement loans, automobile loans, manufactured housing loans, boat loans, credit cards, letters of credit, home equity lines of credit, treasury management services, and merchant services. 

&#8203; 

We also operate a correspondent banking and capital markets division within our national bank subsidiary, of which the majority of its bond salesmen, traders and operational personnel are housed in facilities located in Birmingham, Alabama and Atlanta, Georgia. This division&#8217;s primary revenue generating activities are related to its capital markets division, which includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities; and its correspondent banking division, which includes spread income earned on correspondent bank deposits (i.e., federal funds purchased) and correspondent bank checking account deposits and fees from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services for correspondents, asset/liability consulting related activities, international wires, and other clearing and corporate checking account services. The correspondent banking and capital markets division was further expanded with the addition of Duncan-Williams on February 1, 2021. 

&#8203; 

We have pursued, and continue to pursue, a growth strategy that focuses on organic growth, supplemented by acquisitions of select financial institutions, or branches in certain market areas.

&#8203; 

The following discussion describes our results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and also analyzes our financial condition as of March 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 . Like most financial institutions, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we may pay interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is the amount of our net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our 

&#160; 

interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. 

Of course, there are risks inherent in all loans, as such we maintain an allowance for credit losses, otherwise referred to herein as ACL, to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. We establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for credit losses against our operating earnings. In the following discussion, we have included a detailed discussion of this process. 

&#8203; 

In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers. We incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings, the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits. We describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion. 

&#8203; 

The following sections also identify significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report. 

&#8203; 

Recent Events 

&#8203; 

Although the economy has been recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine distributions and

treatments are generally available, businesses throughout the United States and our customers are still being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on various developments and other factors, including, among others, an increase in cases as a result of new waves of the pandemic or as new variants of the disease begin to circulate, how federal, state and local governments and the private sector respond, and the associated impacts on the economy, financial markets and our customers, employees and vendors. 

&#8203; 

We are continuously monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and financial condition. While there have been improvements in the economic forecasts starting in 2021, resulting in a recovery for credit losses of $8.4 million during the first quarter of 2022 and $165.3 million year-to-date in 2021, there is continued uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic and its latest Omicron variants, as well as other global events, that may result in additional provision for credit losses in the future. 

&#8203; 

In addition, growth in economic activity and demand for goods and services, alongside labor shortages and supply chain complications, has contributed to rising inflation. In response, the Federal Reserve has begun raising interest rates and signaled that it will continue to raise rates and taper its purchase of mortgage and other bonds. The timing and impact of inflation and rising interest rates on our business, financial and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.

Atlantic Capital Bancshares, Inc. (&#8220;Atlantic Capital&#8221;) Merger 

On March 1, 2022, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Atlantic Capital, the holding company for Atlantic Capital Bank (&#8220;ACB&#8221;), in a stock transaction. Pursuant to the merger agreement, (i) Atlantic Capital merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger, and (ii) immediately following the merger, SouthState Bank N.A. (&#8220;SSB&#8221;) merged with and into ACB, with SSB continuing as the surviving bank in the bank merger. 

Under the terms of the merger agreement, shareholders of Atlantic Capital received 0.36 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock for each share of Atlantic Capital common stock they owned. In total, the purchase price for Atlantic Capital was $657.8 million. 

In the acquisition, the Company acquired $2.4 billion of loans, including PPP loans, at fair value, net of $48.7 million, or 2.01%, estimated discount to the outstanding principal balance, representing 10.0% of the Company&#8217;s total loans at December 31, 2021. Of the total loans acquired, Management identified $112.7 million that had more than insignificantly deteriorated since origination and were thus determined to be PCD loans. Additional details regarding the Atlantic Capital merger are discussed in Note 4 &#8212; Mergers and Acquisitions. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Overdraft Program 

&#8203; 

In April 2022, the Company announced it will be modifying its consumer overdraft program to eliminate NSF fees as well as transfer fees to cover overdrafts. It will also offer a deposit product with no overdraft fees. The changes will be implemented starting in the third quarter of 2022 and are estimated to reduce diluted annual earnings per share by approximately 8 to 10 cents. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

&#8203; 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the banking industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by Management&#8217;s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 2 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 &#8212; Recent Accounting and Regulatory Pronouncements of our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

&#8203; 

The following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.

&#8203; 

Allowance for Credit Losses or ACL 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects Management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. Management uses a systematic methodology to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, Management&#8217;s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion. The Company&#8217;s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects Management&#8217;s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for Management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses. See Note 2 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL. See also Note 7 &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; in this MD&#38;A.

&#8203; 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

&#8203; 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in a business combination. As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the balance of goodwill was $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. As a result of the Atlantic Capital merger on March 1, 2022, the Company recognized additional goodwill of $342.9 million. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset&#8217;s fair value. 

We changed the annual impairment date to October 31 during the second quarter of 2021 in order for the valuation to be closer to our year-end audit date. Our most recent evaluation of goodwill was performed as of October 31, 2021, and we determined that no impairment charge was necessary. Our stock price has traded above book value and tangible book value in the first three months of 2022. Our stock price closed on March 31, 2022 at $81.59, which was above book value of $68.30 and tangible book value of $41.05. We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 and other global events on the Company&#8217;s business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. If the economy deteriorates and our stock price falls below current levels, we will have to reevaluate the impact on our financial condition and potential impairment of goodwill. 

&#160; 

Core deposit intangibles and client list intangibles consist primarily of amortizing assets established during the acquisition of other banks. This includes whole bank acquisitions and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities from other financial institutions. Core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of long-term deposit relationships acquired in these transactions. Client list intangibles represent the value of long-term client relationships for the correspondent banking, wealth and trust management businesses. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives, such as deposit accounts in the case of core deposit intangible, on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from this intangible. The estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness. 

Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets 

&#8203; 

Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in our consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of certain assets and liabilities, including loans, available for sale securities, ACL, write downs of OREO properties and bank properties held for sale, accumulated depreciation, net operating loss carry forwards, accretion income, deferred compensation, intangible assets, mortgage servicing rights, and post-retirement benefits. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that a deferred tax asset is not realizable. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2022 were $136.1 million which was up from $65.0 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase in deferred tax assets during the first three months of 2022 was mostly attributable to an increase in the fair value of loans, as well as the addition of deferred taxes from Atlantic Capital. 

&#8203; 

The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Additionally, income tax returns are filed by the Company or its subsidiaries in the states of Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia and in New York City. We evaluate the need for income tax reserves related to uncertain income tax positions but had no material reserves at March 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021.

&#8203; 

Other Real Estate Owned and Bank Property Held For Sale 

&#8203; 

Other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;) consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans. Both OREO and bank property held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and the fair value was determined on the basis of current valuations obtained principally from independent sources and adjusted for estimated selling costs. For OREO, at the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral, any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the ACL. At the time a bank property is no longer in service and is moved to held for sale, any excess of the current book value over fair value is recorded as an expense in the Statements of Net Income. Subsequent adjustments to this value are described below in the following paragraph. 

&#8203; 

We report subsequent declines in the fair value of OREO and bank properties held for sale below the new cost basis through valuation adjustments. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of these properties, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility. In response to market conditions and other economic factors, Management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy. As a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from the current valuations used to determine the fair value of these properties. Management reviews the value of these properties periodically and adjusts the values as appropriate. Revenue and expenses from OREO operations, as well as gains or losses on sales and any subsequent adjustments to the value, are recorded as OREO and Loan Related expense, a component of Noninterest Expense on the Statements of Net Income. For bank property held for sale, any adjustments to fair value, as well as gains or losses on sales, are recorded in Other Expense, a component of Noninterest Expense on the Statements of Net Income. 

&#160; 

Results of Operations 

&#8203; 

Overview 

&#8203; 

We reported consolidated net income of $100.3 million, or diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) of $1.39, for the first quarter of 2022 as compared to consolidated net income of $146.9 million, or diluted EPS of $2.06, in the comparable period of 2021, a 31.7% decrease in consolidated net income and a 32.3% decrease in diluted EPS. The $46.6 million decrease in consolidated net income was the net result of the following items: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Decreased interest income of $8.0 million, resulting from a $26.4 million decrease in interest income from loans and loans held for sale, partially offset by a $16.5 million increase in interest income from investment securities and a $1.9 million increase in interest income on federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest-bearing deposits; &#9679; Decreased interest expense of $7.5 million, which resulted from a decline in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 15 basis points. The decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was due to the Company continuing to lower interest-bearing deposit rates as the interest rate environment remained low during 2021; &#9679; A $50.0 million reduction in the release of the allowance for credit losses, as the Company recorded a release of the allowance for credit losses of $8.4 million in the first quarter of 2022 while recording a release of the allowance for credit losses of $58.4 million in the first quarter of 2021. In the first quarter of 2021, with the continued stabilization in the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic and increased availability of the vaccine, the Company started to release some of the allowance built in 2020 based on improvements in economic forecasts. The economy and economic forecasts have continued to improve throughout 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 and we have continued to release the allowance for credit losses; &#9679; Decreased noninterest income of $10.2 million was primarily from a decline in mortgage banking income of $16.3 million. This decrease was partially offset by increases of $3.6 million in fees on deposit accounts, $1.2 million in trust and investment services income and a $2.1 million increase in other noninterest income driven by an increase of $2.0 million in income from bank owned life insurance. (See Noninterest Income section on page 56 for further discussion); &#9679; Decreased noninterest expense of $111,000, which resulted primarily from a decline in salaries and employee benefits of $2.7 million, in OREO and loan related expense of $1.2 million and occupancy expense of $1.5 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in other noninterest expense of $4.4 million and in FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges of $1.0 million (See Noninterest Expense section on page 57 for further discussion); and &#9679; Lower income tax provision of $14.0 million primarily due to lower pretax book income between the two quarters. The Company recorded pretax book income of $127.4 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to pretax book income of $188.0 million in the first quarter of 2021. Our effective tax rate was 21.26% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to 21.83% for the three months ended March 31, 2021. &#8203; 

Our quarterly efficiency ratio increased to 63.0% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 61.1% in the first quarter of 2021. The increase in the efficiency ratio compared to the first quarter of 2021 was the result of the 0.3% increase in noninterest expense (excluding amortization of intangibles) along with a 2.8% decrease in the total of tax-equivalent (&#8220;TE&#8221;) net interest income and noninterest income. The reduction in income was mainly due to a $16.3 million decline in mortgage banking income. 

&#8203; 

Basic and diluted EPS were $1.40 and $1.39, respectively, for the first quarter of 2022, compared to $2.07 and $2.06, respectively, for the first quarter of 2021. The decrease in basic and diluted EPS was due to a 31.7% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 partially offset by an increase in average basic common shares of 0.6%. The increase in average basic common shares was due to the Company issuing 7.3 million shares on March 1, 2022 with the Atlantic Capital acquisition, less the 2.8 million of stock repurchases completed by the Company between March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022.

&#8203; 

&#9679; For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the return on average assets, the return on average equity and the return on average tangible equity decreased compared to the same periods in 2021. These decreases were primarily due to the decrease in net income of $46.6 million, or 31.7%, which was mainly attributable to the lower amount of releases in the allowance for credit losses in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the releases for credit losses in the first quarter of 2021 along with the reduction in noninterest income due to a decline in mortgage banking income. The decline in the return on average assets was the result of average assets increasing $4.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 due to both the assets acquired in the merger with Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022 and the increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from the growth in deposits in the second half of 2021 and into 2022. The return on average equity and the return on average tangible equity declined due to the increase in average equity of $250.0 million in 2022 compared to 2021 as a result of the equity issued for the acquisition of Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022, which was partially offset by the stock repurchases completed by the Company through March 31, 2022. &#9679; The equity-to-assets ratio was 11.20% for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, a decrease of 0.68% from March 31, 2021, which was mainly due to the increase in total assets resulting from higher levels of cash and cash equivalents and investment securities as our liquidity has increased through the growth in deposits, and the assets acquired through the Atlantic Capital transaction completed on March 1, 2022. &#9679; Dividend payout ratios were 33.71% for the three-month period ending March 31, 2022 and 22.72% for the three-month period ending March 31, 2021. The increase in the dividend payout ratio is due to lower net income in the current quarter compared to the same period in the prior year, while the amount of the dividend paid per share increased to $0.49 in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $0.47 in the first quarter of 2021. Net Interest Income and Margin 

&#8203; 

Non-TE net interest income decreased $524,000, or 0.2%, to $261.5 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $262.0 million in the same period in 2021. Interest earning assets averaged $38.5 billion during the three months period ended March 31, 2022 compared to $34.2 billion for the same period in 2021, an increase of $4.3 billion, or 12.5%. Interest bearing liabilities averaged $24.9 billion during the three months period ended March 31, 2022 compared to $22.4 billion for the same period in 2021, an increase of $2.5 billion, or 11.2% . In March of 2020, the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rates remained at this low level until mid-March 2022, when the Federal Reserve approved its first federal funds target rate increase in more than three years to a range of 0.25% to 0.50%. However, even with the rate increase this quarter, the Company operated under the lower rate environment for the majority of the first quarter of 2022. Some key highlights are outlined below:

&#8203; 

&#9679; Both the non-TE and TE net interest margin decreased by 35 basis points in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter of 2021 due to the decline in the yield on interest earning assets of 45 basis points, which was only partially offset by the lower cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 15 basis points. The decline in the net interest margin was also due to the increase in average balance of the lower yielding federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks and investment securities as a percentage of the average balance of total interest-earning assets. &#9679; Non-TE yield on interest-earning assets for the first quarter of 2022 decreased 45 basis points to 2.85% from the comparable period in 2021. The decline in yield on interest-earning assets was primarily due to a decrease 

&#160; 

in yield on both acquired and non-acquired loans as we continued to operate in a low interest rate environment in 2021 and the first quarter of 2022. In addition, the asset mix changed as lower yielding federal funds sold and interest-earning deposits with banks increased $920.4 million in the first quarter of 2022 to $5.7 billion compared to the same period in 2021 of $4.8 billion, and investment securities increased $3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2022 to $7.9 billion compared to $4.7 billion in the same period in 2021. &#9679; The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the first quarter of 2022 decreased 15 basis points from the same period in 2021. Our overall cost of funds, including noninterest-bearing deposits, was 0.10% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to 0.21% for the three months ended March 31, 2021. These decreases were due to both the Company operating under a continued low interest rate environment for the majority of the first quarter of 2022, along with the reduction in the average balance of the higher costing corporate and subordinated debentures. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits declined 14 basis points as the decrease occurred in all deposit categories. The overall cost of funds also declined due to a $2.2 billion increase in our noninterest-bearing deposits from the first quarter in 2021. &#8203; 

The tables below summarize the analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 and net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis.

Investment Securities 

&#8203; 

Interest earned on investment securities increased $16.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021. This is a result of the Bank carrying a higher average balance in investment securities in 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The average balance of investment securities for the three months ended March 31, 2022 increased $3.2 billion from the comparable periods in 2021. The yield on the investment securities increased 23 basis points during the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. Both the average balance and the yield on the investment securities increased as the Bank used a portion of the excess funds to strategically increase the size of its investment securities, along with the Bank&#8217;s strategy on replacing lower yielding securities with higher yielding securities as long-term interest rates increased in the first quarter of 2022. The excess liquidity was from the continuous growth in deposits since 2021 and in the first three months of 2022 . 

Loans 

&#8203; 

Interest earned on loans held for investment decreased $25.2 million to $232.7 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2022 from the comparable periods in 2021. Interest earned on loans held for investment included loan accretion income recognized during the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 of $6.7 million and $10.4 million, respectively, a decrease of $3.7 million. Some key highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 are outlined below:

&#8203; 

&#9679; Our non-TE yield on total loans decreased 47 basis points in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, due to a 28 basis point decline in the yield on the acquired loan portfolio as well as a decline in the average balance of the acquired loan portfolio, which has a higher yield than the non-acquired loan portfolio. o The yield on the acquired loan portfolio decreased 28 basis points from 4.64% in the first quarter of 2021 to 4.36% in the same period in 2022. &#9726; Interest income on acquired loans decreased by $44.2 million, primarily due to a decrease in the average balance. Also, the Bank was operating under a lower rate environment for the last three quarters of 2021 and for most of the first quarter of 2022 as the federal funds rate increase was not effective until mid-March 2022. This caused the acquired loan portfolio yield to decrease. Further, the loan accretion income declined by $3.7 million during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. &#9726; For the a cquired loans, the average balance decreased by $3.3 billion from the first quarter of 2021. This decrease was mainly related to the impact from the paydowns, pay-offs and renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. This impact had a greater effect than the increase in the acquired loan balance from the Atlantic Capital merger, as the merger closed on March 1, 2022. o The yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio decreased 42 basis points to 3.51% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 3.93% in the same period in 2021. &#9726; Interest income on non-acquired loans increased by $19.0 million, due to an increase in the average balance. The effects from the increase in the average balance were partially offset by the decline in average rate. &#9726; For the non-a cquired loans, the average balance increased by $3.7 billion primarily through organic loan growth and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio . Although the Company saw growth in non-acquired loans, d ue to the current interest rate environment, the rate used in pricing a majority of our new originated loans remained low and below the interest rate on the existing loan portfolio causing the average rate to decline. &#160; &#8203; 

Interest-Bearing Liabilities 

&#8203; 

The quarter-to-date average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $2.5 billion, or 11.2%, in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The cost on interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 15 basis points to 0.15% and the overall cost of funds, including demand deposits, decreased by 11 basis points to 0.10% in the first quarter of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. Some key highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 include: 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

&#9679; The cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.08% for the first quarter of 2022 compared to 0.22% for the same period in 2021, while the cost of repurchase agreements was 0.15% for the first quarter of 2022 compared to 0.25% for the same period in 2021. The cost on the corporate and subordinated debt also declined by 37 basis points for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The declines in cost related to interest-bearing deposits, repurchase agreements and corporate and subordinated debt were due to the Bank operating under a lower rate environment for the last three quarters of 2021 and for most of the first quarter of 2022, as well as the reduction in the average balance of the higher costing corporate and subordinated debentures . These changes resulted in a 15 basis point decrease in the average rate on all interest-bearing liabilities from 0.30% to 0.15% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. o The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by $2.6 billion and the average balance of repurchase agreements increased by $20.9 million. These increases were offset by decreases in the average balances of federal funds purchased and corporate and subordinated debt of $80.0 million and $35.9 million, respectively. &#9726; The increase in average interest-bearing deposits is primarily due to excess deposits maintained in customer deposit accounts and the interest-bearing deposits of $1.6 billion assumed from the Atlantic Capital acquisition on March 1, 2022. Core interest-bearing deposits, which excludes timed deposits, increased $3.7 billion as of March 31, 2022, including the core interest-bearing deposits assumed from Atlantic Capital, compared to a year ago and the average balance increased $3.4 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. These core funds are normally lower cost funds. &#9726; The decline in average corporate and subordinated debt was due to the redemption of $63.5 million in corporate and subordinated debentures in June 2021. The Company assumed subordinated debt of approximately $78.4 million from Atlantic Capital on the acquisition date of March 1, 2022. However, as the merger closed in the later part of the first quarter of 2022, the impact of the acquired balance to the average was less than the impact of the redemption of $63.5 million that occurred in June 2021. The interest expense from corporate and subordinated debt decreased $777,000 during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. o The decline in interest expense of $7.5 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was driven by lower costs on interest-bearing deposits, repurchase agreements and corporate and subordinated debentures, along with the average balance reductions in federal funds purchased and corporate and subordinated debentures. &#8203; 

We continue to monitor and adjust rates paid on deposit products as part of our strategy to manage our net interest margin. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits, CDs, other time deposits, federal funds purchased, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include NOW, HSA, IOLTA, and Market Rate checking accounts. 

&#8203; 

Noninterest-Bearing Deposits 

&#8203; 

Noninterest-bearing deposits are transaction accounts that provide our Bank with &#8220;interest-free&#8221; sources of funds. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $2.2 billion (including the noninterest-bearing deposits assumed from Atlantic Capital), or 22.1%, to $12.3 billion in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $10.0 billion during the same period in 2021. The increase in average noninterest-bearing deposits was primarily due to our focus on relationship banking and the overall liquidity in banking system. The Company also acquired noninterest-bearing deposit balances from Atlantic Capital which affected the average balance for the last 30 days of the first quarter of 2022. The noninterest-bearing deposit balances from Atlantic Capital on the acquisition date were approximately $1.4 billion in total. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Noninterest Income 

&#8203; 

Noninterest income provides us with additional revenues that are significant sources of income. For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, noninterest income comprised 24.8% and 26.9%, respectively, of total net interest income and noninterest income.

&#8203; 

Noninterest income decreased by $10.2 million, or 10.6%, during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. This quarterly change in total noninterest income resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Service charges on deposit accounts was higher by $2.8 million, or 17.4%, in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was mainly due to an increase in service charge account maintenance fees of $945,000, in NSF and AOP charges of $1.2 million and in wire transfer fees of $472,000. &#9679; Debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was higher by $820,000, or 8.9%, in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021. The increase in debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was mainly driven by higher debit card income of $382,000, credit card sales incentive of $424,000 and foreign ATM fee income of $418,000. &#9679; Mortgage banking income decreased by $16.3 million, or 60.6%, during the current quarter compared to the same period of the prior year, which was comprised of $18.6 million, or 69.9%, decrease from mortgage income in the secondary market and a $2.3 million, or 742.5%, increase from mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge. During the current quarter, the Company allocated a lower percentage of its mortgage production and pipeline to the secondary market compared to the same quarter in 2021, which resulted in a decrease in mortgage income from the secondary market. During the first quarter of 2022, mortgage income from the secondary market comprised of a $6.4 million decline in the change in fair value of the pipeline, loans held for sale and MBS forward trades and a $14.4 million gain on sale of mortgage loans, which is net of the commission expense related to mortgage production. Mortgage commission expense was $5.7 million during the first quarter of 2022 compared to $6.8 million during the comparable period in 2021. The allocation of mortgage production between portfolio and secondary market depends on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate quarter to quarter. The increase in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge, in the first quarter of 2022 was due to a $1.6 million increase in the change in fair value of the MSR including decay along with a $640,000 increase from servicing fee income. The increase in fair value of the MSR is due to a decrease in MSR decay as interest rates have increased since the first quarter of 2021 and the increase in the servicing fee income is due to the increase in size of the servicing portfolio. &#9679; Trust and investment services income for the first quarter of 2022 increased by $1.1 million from the first quarter of 2021 as assets under management have increased $636.1 million or 10.1% in that same time frame. &#9679; Bank owned life insurance income increased $2.0 million, or 59.4%, in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021. This increase was due the purchase of $286.0 million of new policies since March 2021 and the addition of $74.6 million in BOLI through the acquisition of Atlantic Capital in the first quarter of 2022.

Noninterest expense decreased by $111,000, or 0.05%, in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. The quarterly decrease in total noninterest expense primarily resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; A decrease in salaries and employee benefits of $2.7 million, or 1.9%, in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in deferred loan costs, which are applied against salaries and employee benefits, caused by higher loan production volumes and an update in the Company&#8217;s standard loan costs. This reduction in salaries and benefits was partially offset by increases associated with the addition of Atlantic Capital employees for the month of March 2022. In addition, we recorded a total of $10.8 million in commission and $12.8 million in retail and loan incentives expenses during the current quarter, compared to $11.3 million and $10.1 million, respectively, during the first quarter of 2021. &#9679; A decrease in occupancy expense of $1.5 million, or 6.4%, in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. This decrease was mainly attributable to the Company realizing more cost savings and efficiencies from the CSFL merger completed in June 2020, partially offset by costs associated with Atlantic Capital acquired on March 1, 2022. &#9679; A decrease in OREO and loan related expense of $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. This decrease was mainly due to the Company experiencing gains on the sale of OREO and other acquired assets along with having several large recoveries from older losses in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. &#9679; An increase in FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges of $971,000, or 25.3%, in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was mainly due to an increase in the OCC examination fee of $598,000 and FDIC assessment of $335,000 as the Company continues to grow in size and complexity. &#9679; An increase in business development and staff related expense of $905,000, or 26.8%, in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was mainly due to the limited expense in the first quarter of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic as vaccines were just becoming widely available. &#9679; An increase in other noninterest expense of $3.4 million, or 30.6%, in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was mainly attributable to the cost associated with the settlement of two lawsuits in the first quarter of 2022 of $1.8 million along with an increase in fraud and operational charge-offs of $1.7 million during 2022. &#8203; 

Income Tax Expense 

&#8203; 

Our effective tax rate was 21.26% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to 21.83% for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The decrease in the effective rate for the quarter, when compared to the same period in the prior year, is driven by a decrease in pretax income, an increase in federal tax credits available, and an increase in tax exempt income, offset slightly by an increase in non-deductible executive compensation and non-deductible merger expenses associated with the Atlantic Capital transaction that closed during the current quarter. 

&#160; 

Analysis of Financial Condition 

Summary 

Our total assets increased approximately $4.2 billion, or 10.1%, from December 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022, to approximately $46.2 billion. Within total assets, cash and cash equivalents decreased $810.5 million, or 11.8%, investment securities increased $1.8 billion, or 24.5%, and loans increased $2.6 billion, or 11.0%, during the period. Within total liabilities, deposits grew $3.7 billion, or 10.6%, and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $10.8 million, or 1.4%. Total borrowings increased $78.5 million, or 24.0%. Total shareholder&#8217;s equity increased $371.5 million, or 7.7%. The increases in investment securities, loans, deposits, borrowings and shareholder&#8217;s equity were mainly due to the acquisition of Atlantic Capital during the first quarter of 2022. Our loan to deposit ratio was 68% at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Investment Securities 

We use investment securities, our second largest category of earning assets, to generate interest income through the deployment of excess funds, provide liquidity, fund loan demand or deposit liquidation, and pledge as collateral for public funds deposits, repurchase agreements and as collateral for derivative exposure. At March 31, 2022, investment securities totaled $8.9 billion, compared to $7.2 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 24.5%. The ACBI acquisition added $691.7 million of investment securities available for sale to our portfolio. We immediately sold $414.4 million, after principal paydowns, and retained $273.7 million in our portfolio. The Atlantic Capital securities retained were mostly state and municipal obligations. We continue to increase our investment securities strategically primarily with excess funds due to continued deposit growth. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we purchased $2.0 billion of securities, $1.0 billion classified as held to maturity, $980.3 million classified as available for sale and $19.9 million classified as other investment securities. These purchases were partially offset by maturities, paydowns, sales and calls of investment securities totaling $626.5 million. Net amortization of premiums was $7.8 million in the first three months of 2022. The decrease in fair value in the available for sale investment portfolio of $362.1 million in the first three months of 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 was mainly due to an increase in long term interest rates during the three months ending March 31, 2022. 

&#8203; 

The following is the combined amortized cost and fair value of investment securities available for sale and held for maturity, aggregated by credit quality indicator:

* Agency mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;), agency collateralized mortgage-obligations (CMO) and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;) are guaranteed by the issuing government-sponsored enterprise (&#8220;GSE&#8221;) as to the timely payments of principal and interest. Except for Government National Mortgage Association securities, which have the full faith and credit backing of the United States Government, the GSE alone is responsible for making payments on this guaranty. While the rating agencies have not rated any of the MBS, CMO and CMBS issued, senior debt securities issued by GSEs are rated consistently as &#8220;Triple-A.&#8221; Most market participants consider agency MBS, CMOs and CMBSs as carrying an implied Aaa rating (S&#38;P rating of AA+) because of the guarantees of timely payments and selection criteria of mortgages backing the securities. We do not own any private label mortgage-backed securities. The balances presented under the ratings above reflect the amortized cost of the investment securities. 

At March 31, 2022 , we had 1,133 investment securities (including both available for sale and held to maturity) in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $590.3 million. At December 31, 2021, we had 296 investment securities (including both available for sale and held to maturity) in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $106.0 million. The total number of investment securities with an unrealized loss position increased by 837 securities, while the total dollar amount of the unrealized loss increased by $484.3 million. The increase in both the number of investment securities in a loss position and the total unrealized loss from December 31, 2021 is due to an increase in long term interest rates during the first three months of 2022. 

&#160; 

&#8203; 

All investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2022 continue to perform as scheduled. We have evaluated the securities and have determined that the decline in fair value, relative to its amortized cost, is not due to credit-related factors. In addition, we have the ability to hold these securities within the portfolio until maturity or until the value recovers, and we believe that it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovery. We continue to monitor all of our securities with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that we will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of our securities may be sold or would require a charge to earnings as a provision for credit losses in such periods. Any charges as a provision for credit losses related to investment securities could impact cash flow, tangible capital or liquidity. See Note 2 &#8212; Summary of Significant Account Policies and Note 5 &#8212; Investment Securities for further discussion on the application of ASU 2016-13 on the investment securities portfolio. 

As securities held for investment are purchased, they are designated as held to maturity or available for sale based upon our intent, which incorporates liquidity needs, interest rate expectations, asset/liability management strategies, and capital requirements. Although securities classified as available for sale may be sold from time to time to meet liquidity or other needs, it is not our normal practice to trade this segment of the investment securities portfolio. While Management generally holds these assets on a long-term basis or until maturity, any short-term investments or securities available for sale could be converted at an earlier point, depending partly on changes in interest rates and alternative investment opportunities. 

&#8203; 

Other Investments 

&#8203; 

Other investment securities include primarily our investments in FHLB and FRB stock with no readily determinable market value. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, Management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. As of March 31, 2022, we determined that there was no impairment on our other investment securities. As of March 31, 2022, other investment securities represented app roximately $179.3 million, or 0.39% of total assets, and primarily consists of FHLB and FRB stock which totals $164.8 million, or 0.36% of total as sets. There were no gains or losses on the sales of these securities for three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Trading Securities 

We have a trading portfolio associated with our Correspondent Bank Division and its subsidiary Duncan Williams. This portfolio is carried at fair value and realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in trading securities revenue, a component of Correspondent Banking and Capital Market Income in our Consolidated Statements of Net Income. Securities purchased for this portfolio have primarily been municipal bonds, treasuries and mortgage-backed agency securities, which are held for short periods of time and totaled $74.2 million and $77.7 million, respectively, at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Loans Held for Sale 

&#8203; 

The balance of mortgage loans held for sale decreased $61.3 million from December 31, 2021 to $130.4 million at March 31, 2022. Total mortgage production remained strong at $1.3 billion, of which approximately $600 million were originations for mortgage loans held for sale during the first quarter of 2022, but did decline slightly from $1.4 billion, of which approximately $700 million were originations for mortgage loans held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2021. The percentage of mortgage production booked to portfolio instead of being sold into the secondary market increased to 53% compared 46% in the prior quarter. The allocation of mortgage production between portfolio and secondary market depends on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate over time. The secondary pipeline remained steady at $260 million at March 31, 2022 compared to $254 million at the end of last quarter.

Total loans, net of deferred loan costs and fees (excluding mortgage loans held for sale), increased by $2.6 billion, or 44.5% annualized, to $26.6 billion at March 31, 2022. This increase included a $125.3 million decline in total PPP loans from December 31, 2021 and the addition of $2.4 billion in total loans resulting from the merger with Atlantic Capital. Excluding the effects from PPP loans and the acquisition date loan balances from the Atlantic Capital merger, total loans increased $381.3 million, or 6.3% annualized in the first three months of 2022. Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by $932.8 million, or 23.6% annualized, driven by growth in all categories. Commercial non-owner occupied loans, construction and land development loans and consumer owner occupied loans led the way with $350.0 million, $145.6 million and $210.5 million in year-to-date loan growth, respectively, or 37.1%, 33.0%, and 32.1% annualized growth, respectively. The non-acquired loan growth was offset by a $130.3 million decline in non-acquired PPP loans from December 31, 2021. The acquired loan portfolio increased by $1.7 billion, or 87.3% annualized. This increase in acquired loans was due to the addition of $2.4 billion due to the merger with ACBI, net of offsets from paydowns and payoffs in both the PCD and Non-PCD loan categories along with renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The main categories that increased were commercial and industrial loans, commercial non-owner occupied loans and commercial owner occupied loans with $795.3 million, $392.4 million and $287.6 million in year-to-date loan growth. Acquired loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 36.1% and non-acquired loans as a percentage of the overall portfolio decreased to 63.9% at March 31, 2022. This compares to acquired loans as a percentage of total loans of 32.9% and non-acquired loans as a percentage of total loans of 67.1% at December 31, 2021. 

&#8203; 

Allowance for Credit Losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects Management&#8217;s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. The Company established the incremental increase in the ACL at adoption through equity and 

&#160; 

subsequent adjustments through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings. The Company records loans charged off against the ACL and subsequent recoveries, if any, increase the ACL when they are recognized. Please see Note 2 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL.

&#8203; 

As stated in Note 2 &#8211; Significant Accounting Policies under the caption Allowance for Credit Losses , Management uses systematic methodologies to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, Management&#8217;s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. The Company&#8217;s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects Management&#8217;s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for Management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses. The Company&#8217;s ACL is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans. 

&#8203; 

The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans with similar risk characteristics are grouped into homogenous segments, or pools, for analysis. The Discounted Cash Flow (&#8220;DCF&#8221;) method is utilized for each loan in a pool, and the results are aggregated at the pool level. A periodic tendency to default and absolute loss given default are applied to a projective model of the loan&#8217;s cash flow while considering prepayment and principal curtailment effects. The analysis produces expected cash flows for each instrument in the pool by pairing loan-level term information (e.g., maturity date, payment amount, interest rate, etc.) with top-down pool assumptions (e.g., default rates and prepayment speeds). The Company has identified the following portfolio segments: Owner-Occupied Commercial Real Estate, Non Owner-Occupied Commercial Real Estate, Multifamily, Municipal, Commercial and Industrial, Commercial Construction and Land Development, Residential Construction, Residential Senior Mortgage, Residential Junior Mortgage, Revolving Mortgage, and Consumer and Other. 

&#8203; 

In determining the proper level of the ACL, Management has determined that the loss experience of the Bank provides the best basis for its assessment of expected credit losses. It therefore utilized its own historical credit loss experience by each loan segment over an economic cycle, while excluding loss experience from certain acquired institutions (i.e., failed banks). For most of the segment models for collectively evaluated loans, the Company incorporated two or more macroeconomic drivers using a statistical regression modeling methodology. 

&#8203; 

Management considers forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses. The Company subscribes to a third-party service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the United States economy. The baseline, along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios, is used by Management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. Management has evaluated the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and has made adjustments as needed. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and takes into consideration the scenarios in relation to actual economic and other data (such as COVID-19 epidemiological data and federal stimulus), as well as the volatility and magnitude of changes within those scenarios quarter over quarter, and consideration of conditions within the bank&#8217;s operating environment and geographic area. Additional forecast scenarios may be weighed along with the baseline forecast to arrive at the final reserve estimate. While periods of relative economic stability should generally lead to stability in forecast scenarios and weightings to estimate credit losses, periods of instability can likewise require Management to adjust the selection of scenarios and weightings, in accordance with the accounting standards. For the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straight-line approach. The Company generally utilizes a four-quarter forecast and a four-quarter reversion period. 

&#8203; 

The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing recovery have created increased volatility and uncertainties within the economy and economic forecasts. Accordingly, Management has used a blended forecast scenario of the baseline and more severe scenario ranging between two-thirds baseline and one-third more severe scenario to an equal weight between the baseline and more severe scenario since December 31, 2020, depending on the circumstances and economic outlook. As of March 31, 2022, Management selected a baseline weighting of 50%, down from 55% in the fourth quarter of 2021, and increased the more severe scenario to 50%. Neither scenario approximates Management&#8217;s view of the economy. While the current economy appears to have momentum, the baseline minimizes many of the identified 

&#160; 

headwinds that could become a factor, including the duration and depth of inflation and the duration and impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The resulting release was approximately $8.4 million during the first quarter of 2022, which included the Day 1 provision related to the Atlantic Capital acquisition of $17.1 million, including the provision for unfunded commitments. Excluding the day 1 provision related to the Atlantic Capital acquisition, the resulting quarter end release was $25.6 million in total for both the allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded commitments. If the economic forecast weighting had not been adjusted from the fourth quarter of 2021, this would have resulted in a higher release of approximately $12 million, which Management deemed inappropriate given the underlying economic conditions as compared with assumptions in the baseline scenario. 

&#8203; 

Included in its systematic methodology to determine its ACL, Management considers the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. These qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation (i.e., formulaic model results). Each period the Company considers qualitative factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework that includes the following: (1) lending policy; (2) economic conditions not captured in models; (3) volume and mix of loan portfolio; (4) past due trends; (5) concentration risk; (6) external factors; and (7) model limitations. 

&#8203; 

When a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with its segment, the asset is assessed to determine whether it should be included in another pool or should be individually evaluated. The Company&#8217;s threshold for individually-evaluated loans includes all non-accrual loans with a net book balance in excess of $1.0 million. Management will monitor the credit environment and make adjustments to this threshold in the future if warranted. Based on the threshold above, consumer financial assets will generally remain in pools unless they meet the dollar threshold. The expected credit losses on individually-evaluated loans will be estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis unless the loan meets the criteria for use of the fair value of collateral, either by virtue of an expected foreclosure or through meeting the definition of collateral-dependent. Financial assets that have been individually evaluated can be returned to a pool for purposes of estimating the expected credit loss insofar as their credit profile improves and the repayment terms were not considered to be unique to the asset. 

&#8203; 

Management measures expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan. When determining the contractual term, the Company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions, renewals, or modifications, unless the Company reasonably expects it will execute a troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;) with a borrower. In the event of a reasonably-expected TDR, the Company factors the reasonably-expected TDR into the current expected credit losses estimate. For consumer loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the borrower&#8217;s application for a modification (i.e., the borrower qualifies for the TDR) or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. For commercial loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the loan for modification or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. The Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology for a TDR to calculate the effect of the concession provided to the borrower within the ACL. 

&#8203; 

A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, the Company implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. The Company&#8217;s payment relief assistance includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to not apply TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if the concession met the criteria as defined under the CARES Act.

&#8203; 

For purchased credit-deteriorated, otherwise referred to herein as PCD, assets are defined as acquired individual financial assets (or acquired groups of financial assets with similar risk characteristics) that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Company&#8217;s assessment. The Company records acquired PCD loans by adding the expected credit losses (i.e., allowance for credit losses) to the purchase price of the financial assets rather than recording through the provision for credit losses in the income statement. The expected credit loss, as of the acquisition day, of a PCD loan is added to the allowance for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is the difference between the unpaid principal balance and the amortized cost basis as of the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the change in the ACL on PCD loans is recognized through the provision for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is accreted or amortized, respectively, into interest income over the remaining life of the PCD loan on a level-yield basis. In accordance with the transition requirements within the standard, the Company&#8217;s acquired credit-impaired loans (i.e., ACI or Purchased Credit 

&#160; 

Impaired) were treated as PCD loans. As a result of the merger with Atlantic Capital, the Company identified approximately $112 million of loans as PCD and recorded an allowance for credit losses of $9.2 million on acquisition date. 

&#8203; 

The Company follows its nonaccrual policy by reversing contractual interest income in the income statement when the Company places a loan on nonaccrual status. Therefore, Management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on the portfolio and does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. As of March 31, 2022, the accrued interest receivable for loans recorded in Other Assets was $80.6 million. 

&#8203; 

ACB was acquired and merged with and into the Bank on March 1, 2022, requiring that a closing date ACL be prepared for ACB on a standalone basis and that the acquired portfolio be included in SSB&#8217;s first quarter ACL. ACB&#8217;s loans represent roughly 8% of the total Bank&#8217;s portfolio at March 31, 2022. Given the relative size and complexity of the acquired portfolio, similarities of the loan characteristics, and similar loss history to the existing portfolio, reserve calculations were performed using the Bank&#39;s existing CECL model, loan segmentation, and forecast weighting as the first quarter end reserve. The Day 1 ACL totaled $22.9 million, consisting of a non-PCD pooled reserve of $13.7 million, PCD pooled reserve of $5.0 million, and PCD individually evaluated reserve of $4.1 million. It represented about 8% of the combined Bank&#8217;s ACL reserve at quarter end. The Day 1 reserve for unfunded commitments totaled $3.4 million, or 11% of the combined Bank&#8217;s total at March 31, 2022.

&#8203; 

The Company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an off-balance sheet exposure. These primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit. The expected losses associated with these exposures within the unfunded portion of the expected credit loss will be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. Management has determined that a majority of the Company&#8217;s off-balance-sheet credit exposures are not unconditionally cancellable. Management completes funding studies based on historical data to estimate the percentage of unfunded loan commitments that will ultimately be funded to calculate the reserve for unfunded commitments. Management applies this funding rate, along with the loss factor rate determined for each pooled loan segment, to unfunded loan commitments, excluding unconditionally cancellable exposures and letters of credit, to arrive at the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. As of March 31, 2022, the liability recorded for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments was $30.4 million. The current adjustment to the ACL for unfunded commitments is recognized through the Provision for Credit Losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income. 

As of March 31, 2022, the balance of the ACL was $300.4 million or 1.13% of total loans. The ACL decreased $1.4 million from the balance of $301.8 million recorded at December 31, 2021. This decrease during the first quarter of 2022 included a $8.3 million negative provision, net of the initial provision for credit losses recorded for the nonPCD loans acquired from ACB, in addition to $2.3 million in net charge-offs. These decreases were partially offset by the Day 1 ACL of $9.2 million for the PCD loans acquired in the Atlantic Capital acquisition in the first quarter of 2022. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company has released allowance for credit losses based on improvements in the economic forecasts that drive our CECL models with the improvement in the economy and the increased availability of the COVID-19 vaccine. 

&#8203; 

At March 31, 2022, the Company had a reserve on unfunded commitments of $30.4 million which was recorded as a liability on the balance sheet, compared to $30.5 million at December 31, 2021. During three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded a release of the reserve for unfunded commitments, or negative provision for credit losses, on unfunded commitments of $142,000, net of the initial provision for credit losses recorded for unfunded commitments acquired from Atlantic Capital, compared to a release of allowance or negative provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments of $7.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021. With the improvement in the economy and the increased availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, the Company began to release some of this reserve for unfunded commitments based on improvements in economic forecasts. This amount was recorded in (Recovery) Provision for Credit Losses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income. For the prior comparative period, the Company had a reserve on unfunded commitments of $35.8 million recorded at March 31, 2021. The Company did not have an allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financials asset during the first three months of 2022. 

&#8203; 

At March 31, 2022, the allowance for credit losses was $300.4 million, or 1.13%, of period-end loans. The ACL provides 2.63 times coverage of nonperforming loans at March 31, 2022. Net charge-offs to the total average loans during three months ended March 31, 2022 were 0.04%. The decrease in the ACL coverage ratio over nonperforming loans was driven primarily by an increase in accruing loans past due 90 days or more. The increase in the accruing loans 

&#160; 

past due 90 days or more at March 31, 2022 was due to a group of factoring receivables that are deemed to be low risk in nature. Although past due, these factoring receivables are performing as they are expected and are historically brought current during the following quarter. We continued to show solid and stable asset quality numbers and ratios as of March 31, 2022. The following table provides the allocation, by segment, for expected credit losses. Because PPP loans are government guaranteed and Management implemented additional reviews and procedures to help mitigate potential losses, Management does not expect to recognize credit losses on this loan portfolio and as a result, did not record an ACL for PPP loans within the C&#38;I loan segment presented in the table below. 

The following table presents a summary of net charge off ratios by loan segment, for the three months ended March 31,2022:

(1) Consists of real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure. (2) Consists of non-real estate foreclosed assets, such as repossessed vehicles. (3) Includes nonaccrual loans that are purchase credit deteriorated (PCD loans). (4) Loan data excludes mortgage loans held for sale. (5) For purposes of this calculation, total assets include all assets (both acquired and non-acquired). (6) Excludes non-acquired bank premises held for sale of $893,000, $1.0 million, $1.0 million, $443,000 and $1.9 million as of March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet. (7) Excludes acquired bank premises held for sale of $5.5 million, $8.6 million, $14.1 million, $19.8 million and $29.3 million as of March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet. Total nonperforming assets were $118.0 million, or 0.44% of total loans and repossessed assets, at March 31, 2022, an increase of $34.3 million, or 41.0%, from December 31, 2021. Total nonperforming loans were $114.4 million, or 0.43%, of total loans, at March 31, 2022, an increase of $34.1 million, or 42.5%, from December 31, 2021. Non-acquired nonperforming loans increased by $19.1 million from December 31, 2021. The increase in non-acquired-nonperforming loans was driven primarily by an increase in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $18.2 million, an 

&#160; 

increase in commercial nonaccrual loans of $1.4 million, offset by a combined decline in restructured nonaccrual loans and consumer nonaccrual loans of $527,000. The accruing loans past due 90 days or more at March 31, 2022 mainly consisted of a group of factoring receivables totaling $22.6 million that were deemed to be low risk in nature. Although past due, these factoring receivables are performing as they are expected and are historically brought current during the following quarter. After the first quarter-end 2022, over 50% of these factoring receivables have since been collected. Acquired nonperforming loans increased $15.1 million from December 31, 2021. The increase in the acquired nonperforming loan balances was due to an increase in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $12.5 million, an increase in commercial nonaccruing loans of $2.3 million and an increase in consumer nonaccruing loans of approximately $291,000. The majority of the increase in acquired accruing loans past due 90 days or more at March 31, 2022 was due to the addition of $11.3 million in loans acquired in the transaction with ACBI in the first quarter of 2022. The $11.3 million loans from the ACBI merger are United States Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;) guaranteed, therefore, we expect no losses. 

At March 31, 2022, OREO totaled $3.3 million, which included $252,000 in non-acquired OREO and $3.0 million in acquired OREO. Total OREO increased $0.6 from December 31, 2021. At March 31, 2022, non-acquired OREO consisted of 1 property with an average value of $252,000 which was the same property held at December 31, 2021. During the first quarter of 2022, we added 1 property into non-acquired OREO with an aggregate value of $14,000 and subsequently sold that property during the quarter for a gain of $3,000. At March 31, 2022, acquired OREO consisted of 14 properties with an average value of $217,000. This is compared to 11 properties with an average value of $226,000 at December 31, 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, we added 6 new properties into acquired OREO, while selling 3 properties with an aggregate value of $516,000 during the current quarter. On the properties sold, we recorded a net gain of $465,000. 

Potential Problem Loans 

&#8203; 

Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming loans, related to non-acquired loans were approximately $9.7 million, or 0.06%, of total non-acquired loans outstanding, at March 31, 2022, compared to $6.9 million, or 0.04%, of total non-acquired loans outstanding, at December 31, 2021. Potential problem loans related to acquired loans totaled $39.9 million, or 0.42%, of total acquired loans outstanding, at March 31, 2022, compared to $19.3 million, or 0.24% of total acquired loans outstanding, at December 31, 2021. All potential problem loans represent those loans where information about possible credit problems of the borrowers has caused Management to have concern about the borrower&#8217;s ability to comply with present repayment terms. 

&#8203; 

Interest-Bearing Liabilities 

&#8203; 

Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits, CDs, other time deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include NOW, HSA, IOLTA, and Market Rate checking accounts. 

&#8203; 

Total interest-bearing deposits increased $1.2 billion or 20.1% annualized to $24.7 billion at March 31, 2022 from $23.6 billion at December 31, 2021. This increase was mainly driven by interest-bearing deposits acquired in the Atlantic Capital transaction in the first quarter of 2022 of $1.3 billion (balance of deposits at March 31, 2022). During the three months ended March 31, 2022, core deposits increased $1.1 billion. These funds exclude certificates of deposits and other time deposits and are normally lower cost funds. Federal funds purchased related to the correspondent bank division and repurchase agreements were $770.4 million at March 31, 2022 down $10.8 million from December 31, 2021. Corporate and subordinated debentures increased by $78.5 million to $405.6 million. Some key highlights are outlined below: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; The increase in interest-bearing deposits from December 31, 2021 was driven by an increase in interest-bearing transactional accounts including money markets of $1.0 billion, savings of $129.2 million, and time deposits of $18.5 million. Excluding deposits held by legacy Atlantic Capital as of March 31, 2022, interest-bearing deposits declined $148.9 million. Interest-bearing transactional accounts including money markets increased $17.3 million, savings increased $128.3 million, and time deposits decreased $294.5 million. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $2.6 billion to $23.7 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. &#9679; Corporate and subordinated debentures increased $78.5 million from the period end balance at December 31, 2021. This increase was due to the assumption of $78.4 million in subordinated debt resulted from the Atlantic Capital transaction completed in the first quarter of 2022. 

&#160; 

Noninterest-Bearing Deposits 

&#8203; 

Noninterest-bearing deposits are transaction accounts that provide our Bank with &#8220;interest-free&#8221; sources of funds. At March 31, 2022, the period end balance of noninterest-bearing deposits was $14.1 billion exceeding the December 31, 2021 balance by $2.6 billion. The increase was mainly due to the noninterest-bearing deposits assumed from the merger with ACBI in March 2022. The acquisition date noninterest-bearing deposits balances acquired from ACBI totaled $1.4 billion and the balance of ACBI deposits at March 31, 2022 was $1.8 billion. Average noninterest-bearing deposits were $12.3 billion for the first quarter of 2022 compared to $10.0 billion for the first quarter of 2021. This increase was related to organic growth and deposits acquired through the ACBI transaction. The ACBI acquisition was completed on March 1, 2022, therefore the acquired noninterest-bearing deposits were only outstanding for 30 days during the quarter which resulted in a lower effect on the average balance. 

&#8203; 

Capital Resources 

&#8203; 

Our ongoing capital requirements have been met primarily through retained earnings, less the payment of cash dividends. As of March 31, 2022, shareholders&#8217; equity was $5.2 billion, an increase of $371.5 million, or 7.7%, from December 31, 2021.

In January 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the authorization of a 3,5000,000 share Company stock repurchase plan (the &#8220;2021 Stock Repurchase Plan&#8221;). Our Board of Directors approved the plan after considering, among other things, our liquidity needs and capital resources as well as the estimated current value of our net assets. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of the purchases are based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of our common stock, and the availability of alternative investment opportunities . During 2021 and through March 31, 2022, we repurchased 2,829,979 shares, at an average price of $82.27 per share (excluding cost of commissions) for a total of $232.8 million. Of this amount, we have repurchased 1,012,038 shares, at an average price of $85.43 per share (excluding cost of commissions) for a total of $86.5 million during the first quarter of 2022. Of the 3,500,000 shares authorized under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Plan, 670,021 shares of common stock remain to be repurchased. 

&#8203; 

We are subject to regulations with respect to certain risk-based capital ratios. These risk-based capital ratios measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks. The values of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are adjusted based on the rules to reflect categorical credit risk. In addition to the risk-based capital ratios, the regulatory agencies have also established a leverage ratio for assessing capital adequacy. The leverage ratio is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by total consolidated on-balance sheet assets (minus amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital). The leverage ratio does not involve assigning risk weights to assets. 

&#8203; 

Specifically, we are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios:

&#8203; 

&#9679; a CET1, risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; &#9679; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; &#9679; a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and &#9679; a leverage ratio of 4%. 

&#160; 

Under the current capital rules, Tier 1 capital includes two components: CET1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The highest form of capital, CET1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, otherwise referred to as AOCI, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and Tier 1 minority interests. Tier 2 capital generally includes the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying preferred stock, subordinated debt, trust preferred securities and qualifying tier 2 minority interests, less any deductions in Tier 2 instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution. AOCI is presumptively included in CET1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. When the current capital rules were first implemented, the Bank exercised its one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI, allowing us to retain our pre-existing treatment for AOCI. 

In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a banking organization must maintain a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three risk-based measurements (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital), resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. 

The Bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized) and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three risk-based regulatory capital ratios (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital) and for the leverage ratio.

&#8203; 

The federal banking agencies revised their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the implementation of CECL&#894; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the adoption date adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL&#894; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing. CECL became effective for us on January 1, 2020 and the Company applied the provisions of the standard using the modified retrospective method as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. Related to the implementation of ASU 2016-13, we recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of $54.4 million, deferred tax assets of $12.6 million, an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of $6.4 million and an adjustment to retained earnings of $44.8 million. Instead of recognizing the effects on regulatory capital from ASU 2016-13 at adoption, the Company initially elected the option for recognizing the adoption date effects on the Company&#8217;s regulatory capital calculations over a three-year phase-in. 

&#8203; 

In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations that adopt CECL in the 2020 calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by the aforementioned three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of benefit during the initial two-year delay for a total five-year transition. The estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital (modified CECL transitional amount) is calculated as the sum of the adoption date impact on retained earnings upon adoption of CECL (CECL transitional amount) and the calculated change in the ACL relative to the adoption date ACL upon adoption of CECL multiplied by a scaling factor of 25%. The scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the ACL under CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology. The Company chose the five-year transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from the adoption date and the CECL difference for the first two years of application. The modified CECL transitional amount was calculated each quarter for the first two years of the five-year transition. The amount of the modified CECL transition amount was fixed as of December 31, 2021, and that amount is subject to the three-year phase out, which began in the first quarter of 2022.

The Company&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios decreased compared to December 31, 2021. These ratios decreased due to the additional risk-based assets acquired through the acquisition of Atlantic Capital in the first quarter of 2022, which on average, had a higher risk weighting, and the reduction in cash and cash equivalents during the quarter, which are lower risk weighted assets. Risk-based capital increased due to net income recognized for the first quarter of 2022, in addition to the net equity of $658.8 million issued for the Atlantic Capital acquisition and the $75.0 million in subordinated debt, also assumed from Atlantic Capital, that qualifies as Tier 2 capital. This increase in capital was partially offset by the $86.5 million of stock repurchases completed during the quarter. The Tier 1 leverage ratio increased both at the Company and Bank due to the Company recording the full effect of the additional equity resulting from the acquisition of Atlantic Capital, as noted above, while the increase in total assets of $3.5 billion acquired from the acquisition were only included in the calculation of average assets for 30 days since the acquisition was completed on March 1, 2022. Our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory classification. 

&#8203; 

Liquidity 

&#8203; 

Liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations, which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits, extension of credit and payment of operating expenses. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank&#8217;s financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet its obligations. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring policies designed to ensure acceptable composition of our asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. We have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs. 

&#8203; 

Asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans, investment securities and other short-term investments. Management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and investments. Normally, changes in the earning asset mix are of a longer-term nature and are not utilized for day-to-day corporate liquidity needs. 

&#8203; 

Our liabilities provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, interest-bearing deposits at other banks and other short-term borrowings. We engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our Bank; &#9679; Pricing deposits, including certificates of deposit, at rate levels that will attract and /or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our Bank&#8217;s asset/liability management and net interest margin requirements; and &#9679; Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our Bank&#8217;s appeal as a primary provider of financial services. 

&#160; 

Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by approximately $932.8 million, or approximately 23.57% annualized, compared to the balance at December 31, 2021. The increase from December 31, 2021 was mainly related to organic growth and renewals on acquired loans. The acquired loan portfolio increased by $1.7 billion from the balance at December 31, 2021 through the addition of $2.4 billion in loans acquired in the Atlantic Capital transaction on March 31, 2022. This increase was partially offset through principal paydowns, charge-offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans. 

Our investment securities portfolio (excluding trading securities) increased $1.8 billion compared to the balance at December 31, 2021. The increase in investment securities from December 31, 2021 was a result of purchases of $2.0 billion along with $703.7 million in investment securities acquired in the Atlantic Capital transaction. This increase was partially offset by maturities, calls, sales and paydowns of investment securities totaling $626.5 million as well as a decrease in the market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio of $362.1 million. N et amortization of premiums was $7.8 million in the first three months of 2022. The increase in investment securities was due to the Company making the strategic decision to increase the size of the portfolio with the excess funds from deposit growth. Total cash and cash equivalents were $6.0 billion at March 31, 2022 as compared to $6.8 billion at December 31, 2021 as funds were used to fund loan growth and purchase securities during the three months ended March 31, 2022. 

&#8203; 

At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had $150.1 million and $325.0 million of traditional, out&#8211;of-market brokered deposits. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had $826.5 million and $900.1 million, respectively, of reciprocal brokered deposits. Total deposits were $38.8 billion at March 31, 2022, an increase of $3.7 billion from $35.1 billion at December 31, 2021 . This increase was mainly due to the $3.0 billion in deposits assumed in the Atlantic Capital transaction on March 1, 2022. Our deposit growth since December 31, 2021 included an increase in demand deposit accounts of $2.6 billion, including $1.4 billion of demand deposits assumed from Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022. Total borrowings at March 31, 2022 were $405.6 million and consisted of trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures, which includes $78.5 million of subordinated debt assumed from Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022. Total short-term borrowings at March 31, 2022 were $770.4 million, consisting of $343.8 million in federal funds purchased and $426.6 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. To the extent that we employ other types of non-deposit funding sources, typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers, we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds. Our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise. 

&#8203; 

Through the operations of our Bank, we have made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities. These commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to our customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time. We manage the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes. We believe that we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund commitments that are drawn upon by the borrowers. In addition to commitments to extend credit, we also issue standby letters of credit, which are assurances to third parties that they will not suffer a loss if our customer fails to meet its contractual obligation to the third-party. Although our past experience indicates that many of these standby letters of credit will expire unused, through our various sources of liquidity, we believe that we will have the necessary resources to meet these obligations should the need arise. 

&#8203; 

Our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position, as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets, typically including some level of reverse repurchase agreements, federal funds sold, balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, and/or other short-term investments; asset quality; well-capitalized position; and profitable operating results. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our desired liquidity position at any time. We expect that these conditions would generally be of a short-term nature. Under such circumstances, we expect our reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds sold positions, or balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, if any, to se rve as the primary source of immediate liquidity. At March 31, 2022, our Bank had total federal funds credit lines of $300.0 million with no balance outstanding. If we needed additional liquidity, we would turn to short-term borrowings as an alternative immediate funding source and would consider other appropriate actions such as promotions to increase core deposits or the use of the brokered deposit markets. At March 31, 2022, our Bank had $956.1 million of credit available at the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s Discount Window and had no balance outstanding. In addition, we could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks and/or the FHLB. At March 31, 2022, our Bank had a total FHLB credit facility of $3.1 billion with total outstanding FHLB letters of credit consuming $12.1 million leaving $3.1 billion in availability on the FHLB credit facility. The holding company has a $100.0 million unsecured line of credit with U.S. Bank National Association with no balance outstanding at March 31, 2022. We believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on stressed liquidity levels. Liquidity key risk indicators are reported to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. We maintain various wholesale sources of funding. If our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful, we would utilize these alternative sources of funding. Under such circumstances, depending on the external source of funds, our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates charged. This could increase our cost of funds, impacting our net interest margin and net interest spread. 

&#8203; 

Asset-Liability Management and Market Risk Sensitivity 

&#8203; 

Our earnings and the economic value of equity vary in relation to the behavior of interest rates and the accompanying fluctuations in market prices of certain of our financial instruments. We define interest rate risk as the risk to earnings and equity arising from the behavior of interest rates. These behaviors include increases and decreases in interest rates as well as continuation of the current interest rate environment. 

&#8203; 

Our interest rate risk principally consists of reprice, option, basis, and yield curve risk. Reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing characteristics of asset and liability portfolios. Option risk arises from embedded options in the investment and loan portfolios such as investment securities calls and loan prepayment options. Option risk also exists since deposit customers may withdraw funds at their discretion in response to general market conditions, competitive alternatives to existing accounts or other factors. The exercise of such options may result in higher costs or lower revenue. Basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices, which subsequently result in narrowing spreads on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Basis risk also exists in administered rate liabilities, such as interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts where the price sensitivity of such products may vary relative to general markets rates. Yield curve risk adverse consequences of nonparallel shifts in the yield curves of various market indices that impact our assets and liabilities. 

&#8203; 

We use simulation analysis as a primary method to assess earnings at risk and equity at risk due to assumed changes in interest rates. Management uses the results of its various simulation analyses in combination with other data and observations to formulate strategies designed to maintain interest rate risk within risk tolerances. 

&#8203; 

Simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including, but not limited to, the timing of cash flows such as the terms of contractual agreements, investment security calls, loan prepayment speeds, deposit attrition rates, the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates, and the behavior of interest rates and spreads. Equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows. Simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes. Key simulation assumptions are subject to stress testing to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk. Model assumptions are reviewed by our Assumptions Committee. 

&#8203; 

Earnings at risk is defined as the percentage change in net interest income due to assumed changes in interest rates. Earnings at risk is generally used to assess interest rate risk over relatively short time horizons. 

&#8203; 

Equity at risk is defined as the percentage change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value. The discounted present value of all cash flows represents our economic value of equity. Equity at risk is generally considered a measure of the long-term interest rate exposures of the balance sheet at a point in time. 

&#8203; 

The earnings simulation models take into account our contractual agreements with regard to investments, loans, deposits, borrowings, and derivatives as well as a number of behavioral assumptions applied to certain assets and liabilities.

&#8203; 

Mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist of forward sales contracts and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans. These derivatives involve underlying items, such as interest rates, and are designed to mitigate risk. Derivatives are also used to hedge mortgage servicing rights. 

&#8203; 

From time to time, we execute interest rate swaps to hedge some of our interest rate risks. Under these arrangements, the Company enters into a variable rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement. The swap agreement effectively converts the client&#8217;s variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan. The Company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a third-party dealer to offset its exposure on the customer swap. The Company may also 

&#160; 

execute interest rate swap agreements that are not specific to client loans. As of the reporting date, the Company did not have such agreements. 

&#8203; 

Our interest rate risk key indicators are applied to a static balance sheet using forward rates from the Moody&#8217;s Baseline Scenario. This Base Case Scenario assumes the maturity composition of asset and liability rollover volumes is modeled to approximately replicate current consolidated balance sheet characteristics throughout the simulation. These treatments are consistent with the Company&#8217;s goal of assessing current interest rate risk embedded in its current balance sheet. The Base Case Scenario assumes that maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at current market prices consistent with maintaining a stable balance sheet. Key rate drivers are used to price assets and liabilities with sensitivity assumptions used to price non-maturity deposits. The sensitivity assumptions for the pricing of non-maturity deposits are subjected to stress testing no less frequently than on an annual basis. 

&#8203; 

Interest rate shocks are applied to the Base Case on an instantaneous basis. The range of interest rate shocks will include upward and downward movements of rates through 400 basis points in 100 basis point increments. At times, market conditions may result in assumed rate movements that will be deemphasized. For example, during a period of ultra-low interest rates, certain downward rate shocks may be impractical. The Model simulation results produced from the Base Case Scenario and related instantaneous shocks for changes in net interest income and instantaneous rate shocks for changes in the economic value of equity are referred to as the Core Scenario Analysis and constitute the policy key risk indicators for interest rate risk when compared to risk tolerances. 

&#8203; 

As of March 31, 2022, the ear nings simulations indicated that the impact of an instantaneous 100 basis point increase / decrease in rates would result in an estimated 8.0% increase (up 100) and 9.2% decrease (down 100) in net interest income. 

&#8203; 

We use Economic Value of Equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) analysis as an indicator of the extent to which the present value of our capital could change, given potential changes in interest rates. This measure also assumes a static balance sheet (Base Case Scenario) with rate shocks applied as described above. At March 31, 2022, the percentage change in EVE due to a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates was 1.9% increase and 3.3% decrease, respectively. The percentage changes in EVE due to a 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates were 3.8% increase and 8.0% decrease, respectively. 

&#8203; 

Simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions in cluding, but not limited to, the timing of cash flows such as investment security calls, loan prepayment speeds, deposit attrition rates, the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates, and the behavior of interest rates and spreads. Furthermore, equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows. Simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes. For example, higher levels of interest rate sensitivity of deposits to upward movements in interest rates may adversely impact net interest income. Additionally, slower prepayment speeds of loans may adversely impact the economic value of equity in a rising interest rate environment. Key simulation assumptions are subject to stress testing to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk. 

&#8203; 

The analysis provided below assumes the base case reflects Moody&#8217;s Baseline forecast as described above. Parallel and sustained interest rate shocks are applied over a one-year time horizon on an instantaneous and ramped basis. Instantaneous shocks assume immediate, sustained interest rate shocks, whereas ramped shocks distribute the assumed change in rates attributable to the shock evenly across the one-year time horizon. This analysis is applied to a static balance sheet that assumes maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at current market prices and volumes consistent with maintaining a stable balance sheet, with the exception of PPP loans that are not assumed to be replaced. The downward rate shock is subject to product floors and a zero-interest rate.

LIBOR Transition 

&#8203; 

In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR at the end of 2021. On March 5, 2021, the FCA confirmed that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021 for the one-week and two-month US dollar settings and immediately after June 30, 2023 for all remaining US dollar settings. 

&#8203; 

The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) as its preferred rate as an alternative to LIBOR and has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR. Organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. As noted within Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 2021, we hold instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR including floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and hedges, and other financial instruments but is not able to currently predict the associated financial impact of the transition to an alternative reference rate. 

&#8203; 

We have established a cross-functional LIBOR transition working group that has (1) assessed the Company&#39;s current exposure to LIBOR indexed instruments and the data, systems and processes that will be impacted; (2) established a detailed implementation plan; and (3) developed a formal governance structure for the transition. The Company is in the process of developing and implementing various proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of customers, which include: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; The adoption and ongoing implementation of fallback provisions that provide for the determination of replacement rates for LIBOR-linked financial products. &#9679; The adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, consistent with guidance provided by the U.S. regulators, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, and GSEs. &#9679; The selection of SOFR indices as the replacement indices, and successful completion of systems testing using the SOFR replacement indices. &#8203; 

The Company discontinued quoting LIBOR on September 30, 2021 and discontinued originating new products linked to LIBOR on December 31, 2021. 

&#8203; 

We intend to utilize the provisions of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act passed by Congress and signed in to law by the President in March 2022 for certain contracts referencing LIBOR. The Act provides for the use of SOFR as the replacement index with a spread adjustment when the remaining LIBOR indices are discontinued. The Act applies when there is no contract provision addressing the loss of LIBOR and may be used otherwise as well, provided the contract does not provide for a specific replacement index. This aligns with the plan of action currently under implementation by the Company. 

&#8203; 

The Company continues to evaluate its financial and operational infrastructure in its effort to transition all financial and strategic processes, systems, and models to reference rates other than LIBOR. The Company is in the process of developing and implementing processes to educate client-facing associates and coordinate communications with customers regarding the transition. 

&#8203; 

As of March 31, 2022, the Company had the following exposures to LIBOR: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Approximately $7.2 billion of total outstanding loans reference LIBOR. Of this amount, $6.5 billion have maturities occurring after the LIBOR discontinuation date of June 30, 2023. 

&#160; 

&#9679; Approximately $21.4 billion in interest rate swaps that are indexed to LIBOR with a gross positive fair value of $408.4 million and a gross negative fair value of $409.1 million. However, the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. Therefore, the transition to LIBOR will have no hedge accounting impact as changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. Moreover, the exposure of both sides of these swaps is presented in these figures. These exposures are intended to offset each other. &#9679; Trust preferred securities that reference LIBOR and had a total principal balance of $118.6 million. These securities have maturities ranging from October 7, 2033 through March 14, 2037. &#9679; Subordinated debt that references LIBOR with a principal balance of $13 million. This debt matures June 30, 2027 and has an initial call date of June 30, 2022. Deposit and Loan Concentrations 

&#8203; 

We have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers. We have no significant portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries. Furthermore, we attempt to avoid making loans that, in an aggregate amount, exceed 10% of total loans to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities. As of March 31, 2022, there were no aggregated loan concentrations of this type. We do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us. We do not have any foreign loans or deposits. 

&#8203; 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

&#8203; 

We consider concentrations of credit to exist when, pursuant to regulatory guidelines, the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents 25% of total Tier 1 capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for loan losses of the Company, or $931.9 million at March 31, 2022. Based on this criteria, we had seven such credit concentrations at March 31, 2022, including loans on hotels and motels of $1.0 billion, loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings (except mini-warehouses) of $5.3 billion, loans secured by owner occupied office buildings (including medical office buildings) of $1.8 billion, loans secured by owner occupied nonresidential buildings (excluding office buildings) of $1.8 billion, loans to lessors of residential buildings (investment properties and multi-family) of $1.4 billion, loans secured by 1 st mortgage 1-4 family owner occupied residential property (including condos and home equity lines) of $4.2 billion and loans secured by jumbo (original loans greater than $548,250) 1 st mortgage 1-4 family owner occupied residential property of $1.5 billion. The risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time. The loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard ACL methodology. 

With some financial institutions adopting CECL in the first quarter of 2020, banking regulators established new guidelines for calculating credit concentrations. Banking regulators set the guidelines for construction, land development and other land loans to total less than 100% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CDL concentration ratio) and for total commercial real estate loans (construction, land development and other land loans along with other non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans) to total less than 300% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CRE concentration ratio). Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank&#8217;s total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Bank&#8217;s CDL concentration ratio was 57.5% and 55.2%, respectively, and its CRE concentration ratio was 243.0% and 238.5%, respectively. As of March 31, 2022, the Bank was below the established regulatory guidelines. When a bank&#8217;s ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines, banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank Management. Therefore, we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes. 

R econciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP 

&#8203; 

The return on average tangible equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the effect of the average balance of intangible assets and adds back the after-tax amortization of intangibles to GAAP basis net income. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information that is useful to investors in evaluating our performance and capital and may facilitate comparisons with other institutions in the banking industry as well as period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure 

&#160; 

of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider SouthState&#8217;s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of SouthState. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, are not audited, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled financial measures used by other companies. Investors should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of SouthState&#8217;s results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.
