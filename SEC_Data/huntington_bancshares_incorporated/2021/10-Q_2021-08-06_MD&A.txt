EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

Acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation 

On June 9, 2021, Huntington closed the acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation in an all-stock transaction valued at $7.2 billion. TCF was a financial holding company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan with operations across the Midwest. The acquisition added depth in existing markets and new markets for expansion and brings complimentary businesses together to drive synergies and growth. Historical periods prior to June 9, 2021 reflect results of legacy Huntington operations. Subsequent to closing, results reflect all post-acquisition activity. For further information, refer to Note 2 &#8220; Acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Summary of 2021 Second Quarter Results Compared to 2020 Second Quarter 

For the quarter, we reported net loss of $15 million, compared with net income of $150 million in the year-ago quarter. Loss per common share for the 2021 second quarter was ($0.05), down $0.18 from earnings of $0.13 per common share, in the year-ago quarter. The reported net loss was impacted by TCF acquisition-related expenses totaling $269 million, or $218 million, after tax ($(0.19) per common share), in addition to the TCF acquisition initial provision for credit losses of $294 million, or $239 million after tax ($(0.21) per common share). 

Net interest income was $838 million, up $46 million, or 6% from the year-ago quarter. FTE net interest income was $844 million, up $47 million, or 6%, from the year-ago quarter. The increase in FTE net interest income reflected the benefit from the $18.4 billion, or 17%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a 28 basis point decrease in the FTE net interest margin to 2.66%. Average earning asset growth included a $7.2 billion, or 9%, increase in average loans and leases and a $6.5 billion, or 27% increase in average securities, both of which were impacted by the late-quarter TCF acquisition. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $116 million year-over-year to $211 million in the 2021 second quarter. The decrease reflected the benefit from improvement in the macro economic forecast and reduction in risk profiles, partially offset by $294 million of TCF acquisition initial provision for credit losses for the acquired non-PCD loan and

lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments. NCOs decreased $45 million to $62 million. Both Commercial NCOs of $59 million and Consumer NCOs of $3 million were down on a year-over-year basis. Total NCOs represented an annualized 0.28% of average loans and leases in the current quarter, down from 0.54% in the year-ago quarter. 

Noninterest income was $444 million, up $53 million, or 14%, and noninterest expense increased $397 million, or 59%, from the year ago quarter. The increases in both noninterest income and noninterest expense were primarily impacted by the late-quarter acquisition of TCF. 

Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 9.97%, up from 9.84% a year ago. The regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12.24% compared to 11.79% at June 30, 2020. The increase in regulatory capital ratios was driven by earnings, adjusted for CECL transition, offset by cash dividends. The balance sheet growth as a result of the TCF acquisition was largely offset by the common stock issued related to the acquisition, net of goodwill and intangibles, as well as the change in asset mix during 2020 related to the PPP loans and elevated deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank (both of which are 0% risk weighted). The regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios also reflect the issuance of $500 million of Series G preferred stock in the 2020 third quarter, $500 million of Series H preferred stock in the 2021 first quarter, and the issuance of $175 million of Series I preferred stock in the 2021 second quarter resulting from the conversion of TCF preferred stock. 

Subsequent to quarter end, Huntington redeemed $600 million of Series D preferred stock on July 15, 2021, which represented all of the Series D preferred stock issued and outstanding. 

In addition, subsequent to quarter end, the Board approved the repurchase of up to $800 million of common shares over the next four quarters. Purchases of common stock under the authorization may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and accelerated share repurchase programs. 

Business Overview 

General 

Our general business objectives are: 

&#8226; Pursue consistent organic revenue and balance sheet growth. 

&#8226; Invest in our businesses, particularly technology and risk management. 

&#8226; Deliver positive long-term operating leverage. 

&#8226; Maintain aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. 

&#8226; Execute disciplined capital management. 

COVID-19 

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause unprecedented disruption that affects daily living and negatively impacts the economy. As further discussed in &#8220;Discussion of Results of Operations,&#8221; the volatility in the markets and lingering economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic continue to impact our performance. 

Huntington was able to react quickly to the changes required by the pandemic because of the commitment and flexibility of its workforce coupled with well-prepared business continuity plans. Our branches have reopened and we are making plans for colleagues to safely return to our offices in a phased approach. We continue to monitor the impact of the resurgence of the virus and evolving guidelines which contributes a level of uncertainty to when there will be a return to historical norms of economic and social activity. 

Throughout the pandemic, we worked with our customers to originate and renew business loans as well as originate loans made available through the SBA PPP, a lending program established as part of the relief to American consumers and businesses in the CARES Act. Several subsequent congressional acts have reopened and extended the PPP loan program. During the 2021 second quarter, we continued to work with our customers who applied for and received PPP loan forgiveness. Through June 2021, $5.5 billion of the PPP loans have been forgiven by the SBA of the original $11.4 billion of PPP loans originated by both Huntington and TCF prior to acquisition. 

Economy 

Our second quarter results reflected solid fundamental performance. We are seeing encouraging signs of the economic recovery, and customer activity is starting to normalize. Our lending pipelines have continued to grow across the board, supporting our view of increased loan demand later this year.

2021 2Q Form 10-Q 11 

2021 Second Quarter versus 2020 Second Quarter 

Net interest income for the 2021 second quarter increased $46 million, or 6%, from the 2020 second quarter. FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the 2021 second quarter increased $47 million, or 6%, from the 2020 second quarter. The increase in FTE net interest income reflected a $18.4 billion, or 17%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a 28 basis point decrease in the FTE net interest margin to 2.66%. Net interest income in the 2021 second quarter was impacted by the late-quarter acquisition of TCF and also included a $55 million net mark-to-market of interest rate caps, which negatively impacted the NIM by approximately 17 basis points (and long-term debt costs by approximately 318 basis points), and $30 million of deferred PPP loan fees recognized upon receipt of forgiveness payments from the SBA, which favorably impacted the NIM by approximately 9 basis points. The year-over-year decreases in earning asset yields and average liability costs also reflected the impact of lower interest rates and changes in balance sheet mix, including elevated deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank. 

Average earning assets for the 2021 second quarter increased $18.4 billion, or 17%, from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting a $7.2 billion, or 9%, increase in average total loans and leases and a $6.5 billion, or 27%, increase in average securities. The $7.2 billion, or 9%, increase in average total loans and leases was impacted by the TCF acquisition late in the 2021 second quarter, an increase in average PPP loans and robust portfolio mortgage production . Average securities increased $6.5 billion, or 27%, primarily due to the late-quarter TCF acquisition and the purchase of securities to deploy excess liquidity. 

Average total interest-bearing liabilities for the 2021 second quarter increased $7.1 billion, or 9%, from the year-ago quarter. Average total deposits increased $19.5 billion, or 21%, while average total core deposits increased $20.6 billion, or 23%. The increase in average total deposits was primarily driven by elevated balances in both consumer and commercial core deposits largely related to government stimulus, improved retention, and the impact of the late-quarter TCF acquisition. Specifically within core deposits, average total demand deposits increased $14.7 billion, or 30%, average savings and other domestic deposits increased $4.6 billion, or 43%, and average money market deposits increased $2.4 billion, or 9%. Partially offsetting these increases, average core CDs decreased $1.2 billion, or 39%, primarily reflecting the maturity of balances related to the 2018 consumer deposit growth initiatives. Average total debt decreased $3.5 billion, or 33%, primarily reflecting the repayment of short-term borrowings, repayment and maturity of $3.3 billion of long-term debt over the past five quarters, and the purchase of $0.5 billion of long-term debt under the tender offer completed in November 2020, all due to the strong core deposit growth, partially offset by $2.8 billion of debt assumed in the late-quarter TCF acquisition. 

2021 Second Quarter versus 2021 First Quarter 

Net interest income decreased $134 million, or 14%, compared to the 2021 first quarter. FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, decreased $134 million, or 14%, compared to the 2021 first quarter, reflecting an 82 basis point decrease in the FTE net interest margin, partially offset by a $13.3 billion, or 12% increase in average earning assets. Both the net interest income decrease and the NIM decrease reflected the net impacts of the mark-to-market of interest rate caps and the decrease in deferred PPP loan fees recognized upon receipt of forgiveness payments from the SBA. The mark-to-market of interest rate caps was a detriment of $55 million in the 2021 second quarter compared to a benefit of $144 million in the 2021 first quarter. The accelerated recognition of deferred PPP loan fees were $30 million in the 2021 second quarter compared to $45 million in the 2021 first quarter. In addition, 2021 second quarter FTE net interest income was impacted by the late-quarter TCF acquisition. 

Average earning assets increased $13.3 billion, or 12%, primarily reflecting a $7.2 billion, or 9%, increase in average loans and leases and a $4.5 billion, or 17%, increase in average securities. Average balances across earning assets categories reflect the late-quarter TCF acquisition. The increase in average loan and lease growth was partially offset by the reduction of PPP loans due to forgiveness. The increase in average securities additionally reflected the purchase of securities to deploy excess liquidity.

Average total interest-bearing liabilities increased $7.1 billion, or 9%, when compared to the 2021 first quarter. Average total deposits increased $13.4 billion, or 13%, and average total core deposits increased $13.6 billion, or 14%. The increase in average total interest-bearing liabilities and deposits was primarily impacted by the late-quarter TCF acquisition. Specifically, within core deposits, average total demand deposits increased $8.4 billion, or 15%. Average total debt decreased $0.8 billion, or 11%, reflecting repayment of short-term borrowings and the repayment and maturity of $2.4 billion of long-term debt during the last two quarters, partially offset by $2.8 billion of debt assumed in the late-quarter TCF acquisition.

2021 First Six Months versus 2020 First Six Months 

Net interest income for the first six-month period of 2021 increased $228 million, or 14%. FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the first six-month period of 2021 increased $229 million, or 14%. The increase in FTE net interest income reflected the benefit of a $15.4 billion, or 15%, increase in average total earning assets. FTE NIM was unchanged at 3.04%. Average loans and leases increased $5.9 billion, or 8%, primarily reflecting an increase in average C&#38;I loans, inclusive of an increase in average PPP loans, and an increase in average residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate loans. Average earning asset yields decreased 57 basis points due to lower interest rates on loans (down 29 basis points), a decline in securities yields and elevated deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank. Average funding costs decreased 79 basis points, primarily driven by lower cost of interest-bearing deposits (down 41 basis points) and the net impact of the mark-to-market of interest rate caps (benefit of 15 basis points). The benefit from noninterest-bearing funding declined 22 basis points. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

(This section should be read in conjunction with the &#8220; Credit Risk &#8221; section.) 

The provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to maintain the ALLL and the AULC at levels appropriate to absorb our estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments. 

The provision for credit losses for the 2021 second quarter was $211 million, a decrease of $116 million, or 35%, compared to the 2020 second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, provision for credit losses for the first six-month period of 2021 was $151 million, a decrease of $617 million, or 80%, compared to the year-ago period. The reduction in provision expense over the prior year quarter and the prior year-to-date was primarily attributed to the improvement in the forecasted macroeconomic environment resulting from anticipated lower unemployment and higher GDP, partially offset by the TCF acquisition initial provision for credit losses of $294 million ($234 million from non-PCD loans and leases and $60 million from acquired unfunded lending commitments) (See Credit Quality discussion).

2021 Second Quarter versus 2020 Second Quarter 

Total noninterest income for the 2021 second quarter increased $53 million, or 14%, from the year-ago quarter. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $28 million, or 47%, primarily reflecting normalization of customer activity versus fee waivers due to COVID-19 in the year-ago quarter. Card and payment processing income increased $21 million, or 36%, primarily reflecting higher debit card usage. Trust and investment management services increased $11 million, or 24%, reflecting continued strong net asset flows and positive equity market performance over the prior twelve months. Net gains (losses) on sales of securities increased $11 million, reflecting securities portfolio optimization. Partially offsetting these increases, mortgage banking income, decreased $29 million, or 30%, primarily reflecting lower secondary marketing spreads and a decrease in salable mortgage originations, in addition to lower net mortgage servicing income. In addition to these changes, 2021 second quarter noninterest income across categories was impacted by the late-quarter acquisition of TCF. 

2021 Second Quarter versus 2021 First Quarter 

Compared to the 2021 first quarter, total noninterest income increased $49 million, or 12%. Other noninterest income increased $22 million, or 73%, primarily reflecting the unfavorable Visa Class B derivative fair value adjustment in the prior quarter, increased amortization of upfront card-related contract renewal fees, and increased mezzanine investment income. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $19 million, or 28%, primarily reflecting normalization of customer activity. Card and payment processing income increased $15 million, or 23%, primarily reflecting higher debit card usage. Gains on sales of securities increased $10 million, reflecting securities portfolio optimization. Partially offsetting these increases, mortgage banking income decreased $33 million, or 33%, primarily reflecting a decrease in salable mortgage originations, lower secondary marketing spreads, and a decrease in net MSR risk management activities. In addition to these changes, 2021 second quarter noninterest income across categories was impacted by the late-quarter acquisition of TCF.

Noninterest income for the first six-month period of 2021 increased $87 million, or 12%, from the year-ago period. Card and payment processing income increased $28 million, or 24%, primarily reflecting an increase in debit card usage largely from reduced customer activity as a result of the pandemic stay-at-home orders in the prior year period. Trust and investment management services increased $16 million, or 17%, primarily reflecting higher sales production and overall market performance. Mortgage banking increased $13 million, or 8%, reflecting increased salable volume partially offset by lower secondary marketing spreads. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $9 million, or 6%, as the prior year period reflected pandemic-related fee waivers. Other income increased $11 million or 15% primarily reflecting increased mezzanine investment income and increased amortization of upfront card-related contract renewal fees, partially offset by an unfavorable Visa Class B derivative fair value adjustment in the current year, as well as the gain on the annuitization of a retiree health plan in the prior year period. Net gains (losses) on sales of securities increased $11 million, reflecting securities portfolio optimization. These increases were offset by an $11 million decrease in gain on sale of loans reflecting lower SBA loan sales resulting from the strategic decision to retain SBA loans on the balance sheet. In addition to these changes, first six-month period of 2021 noninterest income across categories was impacted by the late-quarter acquisition of TCF.

Provision for Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes in the 2021 second quarter was $14 million, compared with $31 million in the 2020 second quarter and $102 million in the 2021 first quarter. The provision for income taxes for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 was $116 million and $41 million, respectively. All periods included the benefits from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, general business credits, investments in qualified affordable housing projects, and capital losses. The effective tax rates for the 2021 second quarter, 2020 

2021 2Q Form 10-Q 19 

second quarter, and 2021 first quarter were (2,353.3)%, 17.2%, and 16.1%, respectively. Excluding TCF acquisition-related expenses of $269 million, the related tax benefit of $51 million and discrete tax expenses of $16 million, the 2021 second quarter effective tax rate would have been 18.8%. The effective tax rates for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 were 18.5% and 17.2%, respectively. 

The net federal deferred tax liability was $179 million and the net state deferred tax asset was $27 million at June 30, 2021. 

We file income tax returns with the IRS and various state, city, and foreign jurisdictions. Federal income tax audits have been completed for tax years through 2009. The 2010 and 2011 tax years remain under exam by the IRS. While the statute of limitations remains open for tax years 2012 through 2019, the IRS has advised that tax years 2012 through 2014 will not be audited and is currently examining the 2015 and 2016 federal income tax returns. Also, with few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations for tax years before 2016. 

RISK MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL 

We use a multi-faceted approach to risk governance. It begins with the Board of Directors defining our risk appetite as aggregate moderate-to-low. Risk awareness, identification and assessment, reporting, and active management are key elements in overall risk management. Controls include, among others, effective segregation of duties, access, and authorization and reconciliation procedures, as well as staff education and a disciplined assessment process. 

We believe that our primary risk exposures are credit, market, liquidity, operational and compliance. More information on risk can be found in the Risk Factors section included in Item 1A of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The MD&#38;A included in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read in conjunction with this MD&#38;A as this discussion provides only material updates to the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. This MD&#38;A should also be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements , Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements , and other information contained in this report. Our definition, philosophy, and approach to risk management have not materially changed from the discussion presented in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Credit Risk 

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation. The majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending. We also have credit risk associated with our investment securities portfolios (see Note 3 &#8220; Investment Securities and Other Securities &#8221; of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). We engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing, asset and liability management, mortgage banking, and trading activities. A variety of derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, caps, floors, and collars, are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements. We also use derivatives, principally loan sale commitments, in hedging our mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and its mortgage loans held for sale. While there is credit risk associated with derivative activity, we believe this exposure is minimal. 

We focus on the early identification, monitoring, and management of all aspects of our credit risk. In addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes, market risk management activities, and portfolio diversification, we use quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources, enhanced modeling technology, and internal stress testing processes. Our ongoing expansion of portfolio management resources is central to our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile. In our efforts to identify risk mitigation techniques, we have focused on product design features, origination policies, and solutions for delinquent or stressed borrowers.

Our loan portfolio is a managed mix of consumer and commercial credits. We manage the overall credit exposure and portfolio composition via a credit concentration policy. The policy designates specific loan types, collateral types, and loan structures to be formally tracked and assigned maximum exposure limits as a percentage of capital. C&#38;I lending by NAICS categories, specific limits for CRE project types, loans secured by residential real estate, large dollar exposures, and designated high risk loan categories represent examples of specifically tracked 

2021 2Q Form 10-Q 21 

components of our concentration management process. There are no identified concentrations that exceed the assigned exposure limit. Our concentration management policy is approved by the ROC of the Board of Directors and is used to ensure a high quality, well diversified portfolio that is consistent with our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile. Changes to existing concentration limits, incorporating specific information relating to the potential impact on the overall portfolio composition and performance metrics, require the approval of the ROC prior to implementation.

Credit Quality 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 4 &#8220; Loans / Leases &#8221; and Note 5 &#8220; Allowance for Credit Losses &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

We believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance is through an analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: NPAs, NALs, TDRs, ACL, and NCOs. In addition, we utilize delinquency rates, risk distribution and migration patterns, product segmentation, and origination trends in the analysis of our credit quality performance. 

Credit quality performance in the 2021 second quarter reflected total NCOs as a percent of average loans, annualized, of 0.28%, a decrease from 0.32% in the prior quarter. Total NCOs were $62 million, a decrease of $2 million from the prior quarter, driven by a $12 million decrease in Consumer NCOs, partially offset by a $10 million increase in Commercial NCOs. NPAs increased from the prior quarter by $470 million or 86%, largely driven by the TCF acquisition.

NPAs and NALs 

Commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 90-days past due, or earlier if repayment of principal and interest is in doubt. Of the $748 million of commercial related NALs at June 30, 2021, $526 million, or 70%, represented loans that were less than 30-days past due, demonstrating our continued commitment to proactive credit risk management. 

The following table reflects period-end NALs and NPAs detail for each of the last five quarters:

TDR Loans 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 5 &#8220; Loans / Leases &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and TDR Loans section appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.) 

Over the past five quarters, the accruing component of the total TDR balance has been consistently over 75%, indicating there is no identified credit loss and the borrowers continue to make their monthly payments. As of June 30, 2021, over 81% of the $419 million of accruing TDRs secured by residential real estate (residential mortgage and home equity in Table 12) are current on their required payments, with over 58% of the accruing pool having had no delinquency in the past 12 months. There is limited migration from the accruing to nonaccruing components, and virtually all of the charge-offs come from the nonaccruing TDR balances. 

TDRs identified by TCF prior to acquisition date are not included in our TDR disclosures as all such loans and leases were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Subsequent modifications are evaluated for potential treatment as TDRs in accordance with Huntington&#8217;s accounting policies.

(1) Loan modifications under the CARES Act, as amended and interagency regulatory guidance are not considered TDRs. 

Overall TDRs decreased in the quarter, primarily related to a decline in the C&#38;I portfolio. Huntington continues to proactively work with our borrowing relationships that require assistance. The resulting loan structures enable our borrowers to meet their commitments and Huntington to retain earning assets. The accruing TDRs meet the well secured definition and have demonstrated a period of satisfactory payment performance. 

ACL 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 5 &#8220; Allowance for Credit Losses &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

Our ACL is comprised of two different components, both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb lifetime expected credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio: the ALLL and the AULC. 

The models used within our loan and lease portfolio incorporate historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period beyond the balance sheet date. We make various judgments combined with historical loss experience to generate a loss rate that is applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balance to produce a reserve for expected credit losses. 

We use a combination of statistically-based models that utilize assumptions about current and future economic conditions throughout the contractual life of the loan. The process of estimating expected credit losses is based on several key parameters: PD, EAD, and LGD. Beyond the reasonable and supportable period (two to three years), the economic variables revert to a historical equilibrium at a pace dependent on the state of the economy reflected within the economic scenario. 

These three parameters, PD, EAD, and LGD are utilized to estimate the cumulative credit losses over the remaining expected life of the loan. We also consider the likelihood a previously charged-off account will be recovered. This calculation is dependent on how long ago the account was charged-off and future economic conditions, which estimate the likelihood and magnitude of recovery. Our models are developed using internal historical loss experience covering the full economic cycle and consider the impact of account characteristics on expected losses. 

Future economic conditions consider multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party and are reviewed through the appropriate committee governance channels discussed below. These 

2021 2Q Form 10-Q 25 

macroeconomic scenarios contain certain geography based variables that are influential to our modeling process, the most significant being unemployment rates and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The probability weights assigned to each scenario are generally expected to be consistent from period to period. Any changes in probability weights must be supported by appropriate documentation and approval of senior management. Additionally, we consider whether to adjust the modeled estimates to address possible limitations within the models or factors not captured within the macroeconomic scenarios. Lifetime losses for most of our loans and leases are evaluated collectively based on similar risk characteristics, risk ratings, origination credit bureau scores, delinquency status, and remaining months within loan agreements, among other factors. 

The macroeconomic scenarios evaluated by Huntington during the 2021 second quarter continued to reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The baseline scenario used for the quarter assumes that the worst of the economic disruption from the pandemic has passed, with the expectation that subsequent waves of the virus will not carry the same level of economic disruption experienced to date. The unemployment variable is incorporated within our models as both a rate of change variable and an absolute level variable. Historically, changes in unemployment have taken gradual paths resulting in more measured impacts each quarter. 

The table below is intended to show how the forecasted path of these key macroeconomic variables has changed since the end of 2020: 

Table 13 - Forecasted Key Macroeconomic Variables Baseline scenario forecast 2020 2021 2022 Q4 Q2 Q4 Q2 Q4 Unemployment rate (1) 4Q 2020 7.2 % 7.5 % 7.2 % 6.4 % 5.5 % 1Q 2021 N/A 6.3 5.7 5.0 4.5 2Q 2021 N/A 5.9 4.5 3.7 3.5 Gross Domestic Product (1) 4Q 2020 3.0 % 3.8 % 5.8 % 4.4 % 3.9 % 1Q 2021 N/A 5.2 5.8 5.3 3.5 2Q 2021 N/A 10.6 6.5 2.7 1.9 (1) Values reflect the baseline scenario forecast inputs for each period presented, not updated for subsequent actual amounts. 

The uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic prompted management to continue to assess the macroeconomic environment through the end of the quarter. Management considered multiple macroeconomic forecasts that reflected a range of possible outcomes in order to capture the severity of and the economic disruption associated with the pandemic. While we have incorporated our estimated impact of COVID-19 into our ACL, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain, including how long economic activities will be impacted and what effect the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and monetary actions will have on the economy and our credit losses. 

Given significant COVID-19 specific government relief programs and additional stimulus spending enacted into law during the first quarter 2021, as well as certain limitations of our models in the current economic environment particularly the level of unemployment, management developed additional analytics to support adjustments to our modeled results. Our governance committees reviewed model results of each economic scenario for appropriate usage, concluding that the quantitative transactional reserve (collectively assessed) will continue to utilize the scenario weighting approach established in prior quarters. Given the impact of the unemployment variable utilized within the models and the uncertainty associated with key economic scenario assumptions, the June 30, 2021 ACL included a material general reserve component as well as additional industry specific risk profiles to capture economic uncertainty not addressed within the quantitative transaction reserve. 

Our ACL methodology committee is responsible for developing the methodology, assumptions and estimates used in the calculation, as well as determining the appropriateness of the ACL. The ALLL represents the estimate of lifetime expected losses in the loan and lease portfolio at the reported date. The loss modeling process uses an EAD concept to calculate total expected losses on both funded balances and unfunded lending commitments, where appropriate. Losses related to the unfunded lending commitments are then recorded as AULC within other liabilities 

26 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. A liability for expected credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recognized if Huntington has a present contractual obligation to extend the credit and the obligation is not unconditionally cancelable. 

The table below reflects the allocation of our ALLL among our various loan categories during each of the past five quarters:

(1) Percentages represent the percentage of each loan and lease category to total loans and leases. 

2021 Second Quarter versus 2020 Fourth Quarter 

At June 30, 2021, the ALLL was $2.2 billion, an increase of $404 million compared to the December 31, 2020 balance of $1.8 billion reflecting the impact of the TCF acquisition. The ALLL to total loans and leases ratio decreased 24 basis points to 1.98% 

The ACL to total loans and leases ratio was 2.08% at June 30, 2021 compared to 2.29% at December 31, 2020. The decrease primarily reflects an improvement in the economic outlook.

2021 First Six Months versus 2020 First Six Months 

NCOs decreased $98 million in the first six-month period of 2021 to $126 million. The decrease was evident across both the Commercial and Consumer portfolios. The Commercial decrease was primarily a function of elevated losses associated within the oil and gas portfolio in 2020, while the Consumer improvement was broad based.

Market Risk 

(This section should be read in conjunction with the &#8220;Market Risk&#8221; section appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for our on-going market risk management processes.) 

Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices, including the correlation among these factors and their volatility. When the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors, the holder faces market risk. We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, equity investments, and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans. 

Huntington measures market risk exposure via financial simulation models, which provide management with insights on the potential impact to net interest income and other key metrics as a result of changes in market interest rates. Models are used to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of the balance sheet based on assumptions regarding the slope or shape of the yield curve, the direction and volatility of interest rates, and the changing composition and characteristics of the balance sheet resulting from strategic objectives and customer behavior. Assumptions and models provide insight on forecasted balance sheet growth and composition, and the pricing and maturity characteristics of current and future business. 

In measuring the financial risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in Huntington&#8217;s balance sheet, Huntington compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates. The market forward reflects the market consensus regarding the future level and slope of the yield curve across a range of tenor points. The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes two types: &#8220;shock&#8221; scenarios which are instantaneous parallel rate shifts, and &#8220;ramp&#8221; scenarios where the parallel shift is applied gradually over the first 12 months of the forecast on a pro rata basis. In both shock and ramp scenarios with falling rates, Huntington presumes that market rates cannot go below 0%. The scenarios are inclusive of all executed interest rate risk hedging activities. Forward starting hedges are included to the extent that they have been transacted and that they start within the measurement horizon. 

Table 17 - Net Interest Income at Risk &#160; Net Interest Income at Risk (%) Basis point change scenario -25 +100 +200 Board policy limits -1.3 % -2.0 % -4.0 % June 30, 2021 -1.0 2.9 6.2 December 31, 2020 -1.1 3.4 7.3 

The NII at Risk results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management. It models gradual (&#8220;ramp&#8221; as defined above) +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates, implied by the forward yield curve over the next twelve months as well as an instantaneous parallel shock of -25 basis points. 

Huntington&#8217;s NII at Risk is within the Board of Directors&#8217; policy limits for the -25, +100 and +200 basis point scenarios. The NII at Risk shows that the balance sheet is asset sensitive at both June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The change in sensitivity is primarily driven by changes in market rate expectations, and the size and mix of the balance sheet.

Huntington is within the Board of Directors&#8217; policy limits for the -25, +100 and +200 basis point scenarios. As of June 30, 2021, EVE depicts a liability sensitive (long duration) balance sheet profile. The change in sensitivity from December 31, 2020&#8217;s asset sensitive (short duration) position was driven primarily by changes in the spot market rate curve impacting forecasted runoff expectations, and the size and composition of the balance sheet as a result of the TCF acquisition. 

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk 

An integral component of our interest rate risk management strategy is use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that we may use as part of our interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, caps and floors, forward contracts, and forward starting interest rate swaps. 

Table 19 shows all swap, floor and cap positions that are utilized for purposes of managing our exposures to the variability of interest rates. The interest rates variability may impact either the fair value of the assets and liabilities or impact the cash flows attributable to net interest margin. These positions are used to protect the fair value of asset and liabilities by converting the contractual interest rate on a specified amount of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. The positions are also used to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate by converting the variable rate index into a fixed rate. The volume, maturity and mix of derivative positions change frequently as we adjust our broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 14 &#8220; Derivative Financial Instruments &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The following table presents additional information about the interest rate swaps, caps and floors used in Huntington&#8217;s asset and liability management activities at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

MSRs 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 6 &#8220; Mortgage Loan Sales and Servicing Rights &#8221; of Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements .) 

At June 30, 2021, we had a total of $327 million of capitalized MSRs representing the right to service $30 billion in mortgage loans. 

MSR fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be reduced by prepayments and declines in credit quality. Prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise. We also employ hedging strategies to reduce the risk of MSR fair value changes or impairment. However, volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges. We report changes in the MSR value net of hedge-related trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income. 

MSR assets are included in servicing rights and other intangible assets in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Price Risk 

Price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting. We have price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, derivative instruments, and equity investments. We have established loss limits on the trading portfolio, on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained, and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held. 

Liquidity Risk 

(This section should be read in conjunction with the &#8220;Liquidity Risk&#8221; section appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for our on-going liquidity risk management processes.) 

Our primary source of liquidity is our core deposit base. Core deposits comprised approximately 97% of total deposits at June 30, 2021. We also have available unused wholesale sources of liquidity, including advances from the FHLB, issuance through dealers in the capital markets, and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers. Liquidity is further provided by unencumbered, or unpledged, investment securities that totaled $14.3 billion as of June 30, 2021. 

Bank Liquidity and Sources of Funding 

Our primary sources of funding for the Bank are retail and commercial core deposits. At June 30, 2021, these core deposits funded 79% of total assets (124% of total loans). Other sources of liquidity include non-core deposits, FHLB advances, wholesale debt instruments, and securitizations. Demand deposit overdrafts that have been reclassified as loan balances were $25 million and $14 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

2021 2Q Form 10-Q 33 

The following table reflects deposit composition detail for each of the last five quarters:

(1) Includes $488 million of noninterest-bearing and $439 million of interest-bearing deposits classified as held-for-sale at June 30, 2021. 

(2) Includes consumer certificates of deposit of $250,000 or more. 

The Bank maintains borrowing capacity at the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window. The Bank does not consider borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window as a primary source of liquidity. Total loans and securities pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window and the FHLB are $54.1 billion and $53.4 billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

At June 30, 2021, the market value of investment securities pledged to secure public and trust deposits, trading account liabilities, U.S. Treasury demand notes, and security repurchase agreements totaled $5.8 billion. There were no securities of a single issuer, which are not governmental or government-sponsored, that exceeded 10% of shareholders&#8217; equity at June 30, 2021. 

To the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits, we may meet our liquidity needs through sources of wholesale funding, asset securitization or sale. Sources of wholesale funding include other domestic deposits of $250,000 or more, negotiable CDs, brokered and other deposits, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. At June 30, 2021, total wholesale funding was $12.3 billion, a decrease from $12.8 billion at December 31, 2020. The decrease from year-end is due to a decrease in negotiable CDs, brokered and other deposits and long-term debt. 

At June 30, 2021, we believe the Bank has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future. 

Parent Company Liquidity 

The parent company&#8217;s funding requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, income taxes, operating expenses, funding of nonbank subsidiaries, repurchases of our stock, and acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet obligations from dividends and interest received from the Bank, interest and dividends received from direct subsidiaries, net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return, fees for services provided to subsidiaries, and the issuance of debt securities. 

During the 2021 first quarter, Huntington issued $500 million of Series H Preferred Stock. On June 9, 2021, each share of TCF&#8217;s Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock was converted into a share of a Series I Preferred Stock of Huntington having substantially the same terms as TCF&#8217;s preferred stock. See Note 10 &#8220; Shareholders&#8217; Equity &#8221; and Note 14 appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 

At both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the parent company had $4.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. 

34 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

On July 21, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.15 per common share. The dividend is payable on October 1, 2021, to shareholders of record on September 17, 2021. Based on the current quarterly dividend of $0.15 per common share, cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately $221 million per quarter. On June 9, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend for the newly created Series I Preferred Stock payable on September 1, 2021 to shareholders of record on August 15, 2021. Additionally, on July 21, 2021, the Board of Directors also declared a quarterly Series B, Series C, Series E, Series F, Series G and Series H Preferred Stock dividend payable on October 15, 2021 to shareholders of record on October 1, 2021. Total cash demands required for Series B, Series C, Series E, Series F, Series G, Series H and Series I are expected to be approximately $30 million per quarter. 

During the first six months of 2021, the Bank paid preferred and common dividends of $22 million and $625 million, respectively. To meet any additional liquidity needs, the parent company may issue debt or equity securities from time to time. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the normal course of business, we enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include commitments to extend credit, interest rate swaps, floors and caps, financial guarantees contained in standby letters-of-credit issued by the Bank, and commitments by the Bank to sell mortgage loans. 

Operational Risk 

Operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error, third-party performance failures, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, including the use of financial or other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results; violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards; and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, failed business contingency plans and security risks. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with significant contracts, agreements, laws, rules, and regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. 

We actively monitor cyberattacks such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data. We evaluate internal systems, processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyber-attacks and, to date, have not experienced any material losses. Cybersecurity threats have increased, primarily through phishing campaigns. We are actively monitoring our email gateways for malicious phishing email campaigns. We have also increased our cybersecurity and fraud monitoring activities through the implementation of specific monitoring of remote connections by geography and volume of connections to detect anomalous remote logins, since a significant portion of our workforce is now working remotely. 

Our objective for managing cyber security risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems. We work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack, and by diligently managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on its own goals. To this end we employ a set of defense in-depth strategies, which include efforts to make us less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats, while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response. Potential concerns related to cyber security may be escalated to our board-level Technology Committee, as appropriate. As a complement to the overall cyber security risk management, we use a number of internal training methods, both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates. Internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks. We also use third-party services to test the effectiveness of our cyber security risk management framework, and any such third parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality. 

To mitigate operational risks, we have an Operational Risk Committee, a Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Committee, a Funds Movement Committee, and a Third Party Risk Management Committee. The responsibilities of these committees, among other duties, include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns, risks, or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues. In addition, we have a Model Risk Oversight Committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and 

2021 2Q Form 10-Q 35 

managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise. These committees report any significant findings and remediation recommendations to the Risk Management Committee. Potential concerns may be escalated to our ROC and the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Significant findings or issues are escalated by the Third Party Risk Management Committee to the Technology Committee of the Board, as appropriate. 

The TCF integration is inherently large and complex. Our objective for managing execution risk is to minimize impact to daily operations. We have an established Integration Management Office led by senior management. Responsibilities include central management, reporting, and escalation of key integration deliverables. In addition, a separate Board Committee on Conversions and Integration is in place to assist in the oversight and to monitor the integration activities, risks and progress of the TCF acquisition. 

The goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk monitoring techniques and strategies; minimize operational, fraud, and legal losses; minimize the impact of inadequately designed models and enhance our overall performance. 

Compliance Risk 

Financial institutions are subject to many laws, rules, and regulations at both the federal and state levels. These broad-based laws, rules, and regulations include, but are not limited to, expectations relating to anti-money laundering, lending limits, client privacy, fair lending, prohibitions against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, protections for military members as they enter active duty, and community reinvestment. The volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk. As such, we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met, including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Our colleagues receive training for several broad-based laws and regulations including, but not limited to, anti-money laundering and customer privacy. Additionally, colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection, equal credit opportunity, fair lending, and/or other courses related to the extension of credit. We set a high standard of expectation for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance. 

Capital 

Both regulatory capital and shareholders&#8217; equity are managed at the Bank and on a consolidated basis. We have an active program for managing capital and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing the Company&#8217;s overall capital adequacy. We believe our current levels of both regulatory capital and shareholders&#8217; equity are adequate. 

36 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

The following table presents certain regulatory capital data at both the consolidated and Bank levels for each of the periods presented: 

Table 21 - Regulatory Capital Data (1) &#160; &#160; Basel III (dollar amounts in millions) &#160; June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Total risk-weighted assets Consolidated $ 126,241 $ 88,878 Bank 125,864 88,601 CET I risk-based capital Consolidated 12,596 8,887 Bank 13,108 9,438 Tier 1 risk-based capital Consolidated 15,462 11,083 Bank 14,292 10,601 Tier 2 risk-based capital Consolidated 2,407 1,774 Bank 2,097 1,431 Total risk-based capital Consolidated 17,869 12,856 Bank 16,389 12,032 CET I risk-based capital ratio Consolidated 9.98 % 10.00 % Bank 10.41 10.65 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio Consolidated 12.25 12.47 Bank 11.36 11.97 Total risk-based capital ratio Consolidated 14.15 14.46 Bank 13.02 13.58 Tier 1 leverage ratio Consolidated 11.65 9.32 Bank 10.84 8.94 

(1) Capital ratios reflect Huntington's election of a five-year transition of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The CECL transition amount includes the impact of Huntington&#8217;s adoption of the new CECL accounting standards on January 1, 2020 and 25% for the cumulative change in the reported ACL since adopting CECL, excluding the allowance established at acquisition for purchased credit deteriorated loans. 

At June 30, 2021, we maintained Basel III capital ratios in excess of the well-capitalized standards established by the FRB. The decrease in capital ratios since December 31, 2020 was driven by the balance sheet growth as a result of the TCF acquisition offset by the common stock issued related to the acquisition, net of goodwill and other intangibles. Earnings for the first six-month period of 2021, adjusted for the CECL transition, was largely offset by cash dividends. The change in regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios for the first six-month period of 2021 also reflect the issuance of $500 million of Series H preferred stock in the 2021 first quarter and the issuance of Series I preferred stock in conjunction with the TCF acquisition. 

Shareholders&#8217; Equity 

We generate shareholders&#8217; equity primarily through the retention of earnings, net of dividends and share repurchases. Other potential sources of shareholders&#8217; equity include issuances of common and preferred stock. Our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives, to meet both regulatory and market expectations, and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities. 

Shareholders&#8217; equity totaled $20.5 billion at June 30, 2021, an increase of $7.5 billion or 58% when compared with December 31, 2020. 

On February 2, 2021, Huntington issued $500 million of preferred stock. Huntington issued 20,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of 4.50% Series H Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Preferred H Stock), par value $0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share). 

On June 9, 2021, each share of TCF Financial Corporation 5.70% Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, outstanding immediately prior to acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation was converted into the right to receive a share of the newly created Huntington 5.70% Series I Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share. 

Given the pending acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation, Huntington determined there would be a material change in the firm&#8217;s risk profile, financial condition, or corporate structure (as defined in the FRB&#8217;s capital rule) and 

2021 2Q Form 10-Q 37 

resubmitted its capital plan in the second quarter of 2021. The FRB also extended, through June 30, 2021, the time period for the FRB to notify Huntington whether the FRB will recalculate its stress capital buffer (SCB) requirement. 

On June 24, 2021, we were notified by the FRB that Huntington&#8217;s SCB requirement would not be recalculated and that beginning on July 1, 2021, Huntington was authorized to make capital distributions that are consistent with the requirements in the FRB&#8217;s capital rule, inclusive of the final SCB requirement of 2.5% provided to Huntington on August 7, 2020. In addition, the FRB notified us that our preliminary SCB effective for the period October 1, 2021, until September 30, 2022 would remain at 2.5%, which is the minimum under the stress capital buffer framework. 

Dividends 

We consider disciplined capital management as a key objective, with dividends representing one component. Our strong capital ratios position us to take advantage of additional capital management opportunities. 

Share Repurchases 

From time to time the Board of Directors authorizes the Company to repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce when the Board of Directors authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Future stock repurchases may be private or open-market repurchases, including block transactions, accelerated or delayed block transactions, forward transactions, and similar transactions. Various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations. 

Subsequent to quarter end, the Board approved the repurchase of up to $800 million of common shares over the next four quarters. Purchases of common stock under the authorization may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and accelerated share repurchase programs. 

BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION 

Overview 

Our business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how we monitor results and assess performance. We have four major business segments: Consumer and Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Vehicle Finance, and Regional Banking and The Huntington Private Client Group (RBHPCG). The Treasury / Other function includes technology and operations, other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. 

Business segment results are determined based upon our management practices, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments. The process is designed around our organizational and management structure and, accordingly, the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions. 

Revenue Sharing 

Revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service. Fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers. Results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations. 

Expense Allocation 

The management process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments. Expenses are allocated to business segments using a two-phase approach. The first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs (activity-based costs) to activities related to product origination and servicing. These activity-based costs are then extended, based on volumes, with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products. The second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from Treasury / Other. We utilize a full-allocation methodology, where all Treasury / Other expenses, except reported acquisition-related net expenses, if any, and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses, are allocated to the four business segments. 

38 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP) 

We use an active and centralized FTP methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments. The intent of the FTP methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities. The result is to centralize the financial impact, management, and reporting of interest rate risk in the Treasury / Other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed. The Treasury / Other function charges (credits) an internal cost of funds for assets held in (or pays for funding provided by) each business segment. The FTP rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets (or liabilities). 

Net Income (Loss) by Business Segment 

Net income (loss) by business segment for the six-month periods ending June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 is presented in the following table: 

Table 22 - Net Income (Loss) by Business Segment &#160; Six Months Ended June 30, (dollar amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Consumer and Business Banking $ 105 $ 165 Commercial Banking 167 (115) Vehicle Finance 161 9 RBHPCG 37 50 Treasury / Other 47 89 Net income $ 517 $ 198 

Treasury / Other 

The Treasury / Other function includes revenue and expense related to assets, liabilities, derivatives (including the mark-to-market of interest rate caps), and equity not directly assigned or allocated to one of the four business segments. Assets include investment securities and bank owned life insurance. 

Net interest income includes the impact of administering our investment securities portfolios, the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity as well as the financial impact associated with our FTP methodology, as described above. Noninterest income includes miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business segments, such as bank owned life insurance income and securities and trading asset gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes certain TCF acquisition-related expenses in the current period, certain corporate administrative, and other miscellaneous expenses not allocated to other business segments. The provision for income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory 21% tax rate, although our overall effective tax rate is lower.

2021 First Six Months versus 2020 First Six Months 

Consumer and Business Banking, including Home Lending, reported net income of $105 million in the first six-month period of 2021, a decrease of $60 million, or 36%, compared to the year-ago period. Segment net interest income decreased $30 million, or 4%, due to decreased spread on deposits and decreased loan margin, partially offset by PPP revenues. The provision for credit losses decreased $51 million, or 45%, primarily due to changes in the forecasted economic outlook compared to the year-ago period, partially offset by the TCF acquisition initial provision for credit losses. Noninterest income increased $47 million, or 11%, primarily due to increased card interchange income as a result of higher debit card usage, mortgage banking income, and higher investment revenue. Noninterest expense increased $144 million, or 17%, mostly due to increased allocated expense and personnel costs as a result of higher levels of production and origination volume as well as the late-quarter TCF acquisition. 

Home Lending, an operating unit of Consumer and Business Banking, reflects the result of the origination, sale, and servicing of mortgage loans less referral fees and net interest income for mortgage banking products distributed by the retail branch network and other business segments. Home Lending reported net income of $23 million in the first six-month period of 2021, compared with net income of $42 million in the year-ago period. Noninterest income decreased $11 million, driven primarily by higher referral fee income distributed to the branch network and other segments, partially offset by higher salable originations. Noninterest expense increased $24 million due to higher personnel expense as a result of the late-quarter TCF acquisition and higher origination volumes.

2021 First Six Months versus 2020 First Six Months 

Commercial Banking reported net income of $167 million in the first six-month period of 2021, compared to a net loss of $115 million in the year-ago period. The provision for credit losses decreased $380 million, or 73%, primarily due to changes in the forecasted economic outlook compared to the year-ago period, partially offset by the TCF acquisition initial provision for credit losses. Segment net interest income decreased $15 million, or 3%, due to a 24 basis point decrease in net interest margin driven by a sharp decline in the benefit of deposits. Noninterest income increased $33 million, or 19%, reflecting the late-quarter TCF acquisition, largely driven by an increase in commitment and other loan fees including increased loan syndication fees, treasury management related revenue reflecting the impact of lower earnings credit rates on commercial deposit service charges, and an increase in mezzanine gains. Noninterest expense increased $41 million, or 15%, primarily due to personnel expense, reflecting the late-quarter TCF acquisition, largely driven by an increase in salaries and sales incentives, allocated overhead, and outside data processing.

2021 First Six Months versus 2020 First Six Months 

Vehicle Finance reported net income of $161 million in the first six-month period of 2021, an increase of $152 million, compared to the year-ago period. The provision for credit losses decreased $184 million due to changes in the forecasted economic outlook as compared to the year ago period. Segment net interest income increased $11 million, or 5%, due to a 17 basis point increase in the net interest margin, partially offset by a 2% decrease in average loan balances. The decrease in average loans and leases balances of $0.4 billion continues to be driven by average commercial balances which were $1 billion lower than a year ago as dealership inventory levels and the resulting floor plan line utilization remain low. Partially offsetting the decline in commercial balances, RV / Marine balances increased $0.7 billion year over year, reflecting strong production levels over the past year. Noninterest income was comparable to year ago while the increase in noninterest expense was largely attributable to higher production related costs.

RBHPCG reported net income of $37 million for the first six-month period of 2021, a decrease of $13 million, or 26%, compared to the year-ago period. Results were impacted by the late-quarter TCF acquisition. Segment net interest income decreased $13 million, or 16%, due to a 64 basis point decrease in net interest margin, reflecting both lower deposit and loan spreads. Average loans and leases increased $0.2 billion, or 4%, primarily due to residential real estate mortgage loans, and average deposits increased $1.0 billion, or 15%, primarily related to higher customer liquidity levels. Noninterest income increased $2 million, or 2%. The comparable period in 2020 included the sale of Retirement Plan Services recordkeeping and administrative services. Total trust assets increased 38% due to positive net asset flows and equity markets. Noninterest expense increased $8 million primarily due to decreased origination rates and higher personnel expense as a result of higher incentives in the Wealth business, partially offset by lower discretionary expense and continued cost controls.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This document contains GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding our results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found herein. 

Fully-Taxable Equivalent Basis 

Interest income, yields, and ratios on a FTE basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes net interest income on a FTE basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes. The FTE basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent. We encourage readers to 

2021 2Q Form 10-Q 43 

consider the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-Q in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

Non-Regulatory Capital Ratios 

In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including: 

&#8226; Tangible common equity to tangible assets, 

&#8226; Tangible equity to tangible assets, and 

&#8226; Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets using Basel III definitions. 

These non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare our capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not defined in GAAP or federal banking regulations. As a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company are considered non-GAAP financial measures. 

Because there are no standardized definitions for these non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company&#8217;s calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, we encourage readers to consider the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-Q in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

Risk Factors 

More information on risk can be found in Item 1A Risk Factors below and in the Risk Factors section included in Item 1A of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional information regarding risk factors can also be found in the Risk Management and Capital discussion of this report. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates 

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as supplemented by this report including this MD&#38;A, describes the significant accounting policies we used in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

An accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time, and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. Our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

Our ACL at June 30, 2021 represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded lending commitments. Management estimates the ACL by projecting probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default conditional on economic parameters, for the remaining contractual term. Internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances, the portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. 

One of the most significant judgments influencing the ACL estimate is the macro-economic forecasts. Key external economic parameters that directly impact our loss modeling framework include forecasted footprint unemployment rates and Gross Domestic Product. Changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses, which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next. 

Given the dynamic relationship between macro-economic variables within our modeling framework, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance. As a result, management uses a 

44 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

probability-weighted approach that incorporates a baseline, an adverse and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate. 

However, to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, management calculated a quantitative allowance using a 100% weighting applied to an adverse scenario. This scenario includes assumptions around new infections and COVID-19 deaths being significantly above the baseline projections, leading to a much slower re-opening of the economy. Under this scenario, as an example, the unemployment rate remains elevated for a prolonged period and is estimated to remain at 7.3% and 6.5% at the end of 2022 and 2023, respectively. These numbers represent 3.8% and 3% higher unemployment estimates than baseline scenario projections of 3.5% and 3.5%, respectively for the same time periods. 

To demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters used in the calculation of our ACL at June 30, 2021, management calculated the difference between our quantitative ACL and a 100% adverse scenario. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our ACL of approximately $1.1 billion at June 30, 2021. 

The resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in allowance levels for a number of reasons including the following: 

&#8226; Management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process; 

&#8226; The highly uncertain economic environment; 

&#8226; The difficulty in predicting the inter-relationships between the economic parameters used in the various economic scenarios; and 

&#8226; The sensitivity estimate does not account for any general reserve components and associated risk profile adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework. 

We regularly review our ACL for appropriateness by performing on-going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio. In doing so, we consider factors such as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. We also evaluate the impact of changes in key economic parameters and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our ACL at each reporting date. There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast. Additionally, events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or our markets such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, could severely impact our current expectations. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the current COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time. For more information, see Note 4 &#8220; Loans and Leases &#8221; and Note 5 &#8220; Allowance for Credit Losses &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Acquisition Method of Accounting 

The acquisition method of accounting requires that acquired assets and liabilities in a business combination are recorded at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. This method often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, all of which are inherently subjective. Acquisition-related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. The acquisition method of accounting does allow for a measurement period to make adjustments to acquisition accounting for up to one year after the acquisition date, for new information that existed at the acquisition date but may not have been known or available at that time. For further information, refer to Note 2 &#8220; Acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Fair Value Measurement 

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including securities, and derivative instruments. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently include subjectivity and may require the use of 

2021 2Q Form 10-Q 45 

significant assumptions, adjustments and judgment including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, cash flows, default rates, loss rates, terminal values and liquidation values. A significant change in assumptions may result in a significant change in fair value, which in turn, may result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility and could result in significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition or disclosures of fair value information. 

In addition to the above mentioned on-going fair value measurements, fair value is also used for recording business combinations and measuring other non-recurring financial assets and liabilities. At June 9, 2021, approximately $46 billion of our assets and $43 billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value as a result of applying the acquisition method of accounting. 

The fair value hierarchy requires use of observable inputs first and subsequently unobservable inputs when observable inputs are not available. Our fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are observable (Level 1 or Level 2 in fair value hierarchy), when available. The level of judgment required to determine fair value is dependent on the methods or techniques used in the process. Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) do not require significant judgment while the valuation of assets and liabilities when quoted market prices are not available (Levels 2 and 3) may require significant judgment to assess whether observable or unobservable inputs for those assets and liabilities provide reasonable determination of fair value. The fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy, additional discussion regarding fair value measurements, and a brief description of how fair value is determined for categories that have unobservable inputs, can be found in Note 13 &#8220; Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Acquisitions typically result in goodwill, the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value, which is subject to impairment testing at least annually. The amortization of identified intangible assets recognized in a business combination is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received over their economic life, which is also subjective. Customer attrition rates that are based on historical experience are used to determine the estimated economic life of certain intangibles assets, including but not limited to, customer deposit intangibles.
