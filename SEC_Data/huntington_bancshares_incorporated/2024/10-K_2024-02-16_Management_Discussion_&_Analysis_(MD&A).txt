 Item 7: Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

INTRODUCTION 

This MD&#38;A provides information we believe necessary for understanding our financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The MD&#38;A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements , Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , and other information contained in this report. The forward-looking statements in this section and other parts of this report involve assumptions, risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including statements regarding our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, and financial performance. Our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; and those set forth in Item 1A. 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

Acquisitions and Divestitures 

In March 2023, Huntington completed the sale of the RPS business and entered into an ongoing partnership with the purchaser. The sale of our RPS business resulted in a $57 million gain including associated goodwill allocation, recorded within other noninterest income. 

In June 2022, Huntington completed the acquisition of Capstone Partners, a top tier middle market investment bank and advisory firm. The transaction brings a national scale to serve middle market business owners throughout the corporate lifecycle, building on Huntington&#8217;s regional banking foundation. Capstone Partners related revenue, including mergers and acquisitions, capital raising and other advisory-related fees, is recognized within capital markets fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For further information, refer to Note 3 - &#8220; Business Combinations &#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In May 2022, Huntington completed the acquisition of Torana, now known as Huntington ChoicePay, a digital payments business focused on business to consumer payments. This acquisition, along with the formation of our enterprise-wide payments group, reflects one of our strategic priorities to accelerate our payments capabilities and expand the services provided to our customers. 

In June 2021, Huntington closed the acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation. TCF was a financial holding company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan with operations across the Midwest. The acquisition brought increased scale and market density, as well as added new markets and capabilities. Our operating results include the impact of TCF subsequent to the acquisition on June 9, 2021. For further information, refer to Note 3 - &#8220; Business Combinations &#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Reporting Updates 

During the fourth quarter of 2023, we updated the presentation of our noninterest income categories to align product and service types more closely with how we strategically manage our business. For a description of each updated noninterest income revenue stream refer to Note 15 - &#8220; Revenue from Contracts with Customers &#8221; of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

During the fourth quarter of 2023, we revised our FTP methodology for non-maturity deposits, which has been enhanced to consider the internally modeled weighted average life by non-maturity deposit type. In general, the impact of the FTP methodology revision resulted in a higher cost of funds allocation as compared with the previous method. 

To align with our strategic priorities, during the second quarter of 2023, we completed an organizational realignment and now report on two business segments: Consumer &#38; Regional Banking and Commercial Banking. The Treasury / Other function includes technology and operations, and other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. Huntington&#8217;s business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how management monitors results and assesses performance. The organizational realignment primarily involved consolidating our previously reported Consumer and Business Banking, Vehicle Finance and RBHPCG, into one new business segment called Consumer &#38; Regional Banking.

During the second quarter of 2023, we revised our process for assessing and monitoring the risk and performance of non-real estate secured commercial loans, primarily loans to REITs. These loans were reclassified from commercial real estate to the commercial and industrial loan category to align reporting with this process revision. 

For the reporting updates discussed above, prior period results have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.

(1) On an FTE basis assuming a 21% tax rate. 

In 2023, we reported net income of $2.0 billion, a $287 million, or 13%, decrease from the prior year. Earnings per common share on a diluted basis for the year were $1.24, down 14% from the prior year. The current year reported net income was negatively impacted by the recognition of the FDIC DIF special assessment totaling $214 million, or $169 million after tax ($0.11 per common share), to recover the cost associated with protecting uninsured depositors as part of the 2023 bank failures and $69 million, or $55 million after tax ($0.04 per common share), of expense from staffing related initiatives and the consolidation of corporate locations. The prior year&#8217;s reported net income was negatively impacted by acquisition-related expenses totaling $95 million, or $76 million after tax ($0.05 per common share). 

2023 Form 10-K 45 

Net interest income for 2023 was $5.4 billion, up $166 million, or 3%, from 2022. FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased $177 million, or 3%, from 2022. The increase in FTE net interest income reflected an increase in earning asset yields and the benefit of a $8.3 billion, or 5%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by higher cost of funds and a $15.3 billion, or 13%, increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. Average earning asset growth included a $5.7 billion, or 5%, increase in loans and leases and a $4.5 billion, or 92%, increase in interest-earning deposits with banks, partially offset by a $1.4 billion, or 3%, decrease in average securities. The growth in average interest-bearing liabilities included a $10.1 billion, or 10%, increase in average interest-bearing deposits and a $5.2 billion, or 46%, increase in average borrowings. 

The provision for credit losses increased $113 million, or 39%, to $402 million, primarily driven by a combination of loan and lease growth and modest overall ACL coverage ratio builds throughout 2023 that is reflective of the current macroeconomic environment. The ACL was $2.4 billion, or 1.97% of total loans and leases, at December 31, 2023, compared to $2.3 billion, or 1.90% of total loans and leases, at December 31, 2022. 

Noninterest income of $1.9 billion, decreased $60 million, or 3%, from the prior year primarily due to lower gain on sale of loans, customer deposit and loan fees, and mortgage banking income, in addition to $24 million of unfavorable mark-to-market on the pay-fixed swaptions program, partially offset by a $57 million gain on the sale of our RPS business and increases in payments and cash management revenue and wealth and asset management revenue. Noninterest expense of $4.6 billion, increased $373 million, or 9%, from the prior year primarily due to the FDIC DIF special assessment of $214 million and an increase in personnel costs, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition-related expenses. 

Total assets at December 31, 2023 were $189.4 billion, an increase of $6.5 billion, or 4%, compared to December 31, 2022. The increase in total assets was primarily driven by increases in interest-earning deposits with banks of $3.6 billion, or 71%, and loans and leases of $2.5 billion, or 2%. Total liabilities at December 31, 2023 were $170.0 billion, an increase of $4.8 billion, or 3%, compared to December 31, 2022. The increase in total liabilities was primarily driven by increases in total deposits of $3.3 billion, or 2%, and borrowings of $1.3 billion, or 11%. 

The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.14% at December 31, 2023, up 59 basis points from December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in tangible common equity related to earnings, net of dividends, and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss due in part from a modest decline in interest rates at year-end, partially offset by higher tangible assets. CET1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.25%, up from 9.36% at December 31, 2022. The increase in regulatory capital ratios was primarily driven by earnings and a decrease in risk-weighted assets, partially offset by dividends. The decrease in risk-weighted assets was largely driven by the synthetic CRT related to an approximately $3 billion portfolio of on-balance sheet prime indirect auto loans.

Economy 

Inflation continues to trend lower while remaining at levels above the Federal Reserve&#8217;s long run target. The Federal Reserve has shifted policy to a more balanced interest rate view and continues to further evaluate the impact of their monetary tightening and the overall health of the economy. The economy has continued to expand with fourth quarter of 2023 growth trending towards 2.0%. Equity markets have remained buoyant anticipating easier policy from the Federal Reserve in 2024. Further banking regulation has been delayed as recent regulatory proposals have been in their comment periods for an extended amount of time, with clarity on proposed amendments to the regulatory capital rule and long-term debt requirements for banks anticipated. 

The consensus economic outlook assumes a soft landing through the first half of 2024 with modest growth in the second half of 2024. Inflation is expected to continue to fall, approaching target levels of 2% by the third quarter of 2024, as the Federal Reserve actions will likely result in lower GDP growth and higher unemployment. 

Our 2023 results reflect the execution of our growth strategy and leveraging the strength of our balance sheet, delivered through sustained deposit growth, bolstered capabilities across our payments and other fee revenue areas, and expansion of our CET1. We have continued our disciplined management of credit consistent with our aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle risk appetite. With our disciplined and proactive approach, we believe Huntington is well positioned to manage through the uncertain economic outlook on the horizon. We remain focused on delivering profitable growth and driving value for our shareholders.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This section provides a review of financial performance on a consolidated basis. Key consolidated balance sheet and income statement trends are discussed. All earnings per share data are reported on a diluted basis. For additional insight on financial performance, please read this section in conjunction with the &#8220; Business Segment Discussion .&#8221; 

For a discussion of our results of operations for 2022 versus 2021, see &#8220;Part II, Item 7: Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; Discussion of Results of Operations included in our 2022 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 17, 2023. In addition, discussion of our results of operations for 2022 versus 2021 for noninterest income and business segment discussion where prior period results have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation are included within this MD&#38;A. 

Average Balance Sheet / Net Interest Income 

Our primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from earning assets (primarily loans, leases, and securities), and interest expense of funding sources (primarily interest-bearing deposits and borrowings). Earning asset balances and related funding sources, as well as changes in the levels of interest rates, impact net interest income. The difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities is the net interest spread. Noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and shareholders&#8217; equity, also support earning assets. The impact of the noninterest-bearing sources of funds, often referred to as &#8220;free&#8221; funds, is captured in the net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets. Both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on an FTE basis, which means that tax-free interest income has been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income, assuming a 21% tax rate.

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income for 2023 increased $166 million, or 3%, from 2022. FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, for 2023 increased $177 million, or 3%, from 2022. The increase in FTE net interest income reflected an increase in yields on loans and leases and investment securities and an $8.3 billion, or 5%, increase in average total earning assets, partially offset by higher cost of funds and a $15.3 billion, or 13%, increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. 

Net interest income for 2023 included $30 million of net interest income from purchase accounting accretion, compared to $61 million and $21 million from purchase accounting accretion and accelerated PPP loan fees recognized upon forgiveness payments from the SBA, respectively, in 2022. 

Average Balance Sheet 

Average assets of $187.6 billion for 2023 increased $8.8 billion, or 5%, from 2022, primarily due to increases in average loans and leases of $5.7 billion, or 5%, and average interest-earning deposits with banks of $4.5 billion, or 92%, partially offset by a decrease in average total securities of $1.4 billion, or 3%. The increase in average loans and leases was driven by growth in average commercial loans and leases of $4.0 billion, or 6%, and average consumer loans of $1.6 billion, or 3%. 

Average liabilities for 2023 increased $8.4 billion, or 5%, from 2022, primarily due to increases in average borrowings and deposits. Average borrowings increased $5.2 billion, or 46%, driven by new debt issuances and higher FHLB borrowings reflecting actions taken as part of ongoing management of funding needs. Total average deposits increased $2.5 billion, or 2%, primarily due to an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of $10.1 billion, or 10%, largely due to increases in average certificates of deposits and money market deposits, partially offset by a decrease in average noninterest-bearing deposits of $7.6 billion, or 18%. 

Average shareholders&#8217; equity for 2023 increased $371 million, or 2%, from 2022 primarily due to earnings net of dividends, a reduction in average accumulated other comprehensive loss driven by changes in interest rates, and the net issuance of preferred stock.

Provision for Credit Losses 

(This section should be read in conjunction with the &#8220; Credit Risk &#8221; section.) 

The provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to maintain the ACL at levels appropriate to absorb our estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the loan and lease portfolio, securities portfolio, and unfunded lending commitments. 

The provision for credit losses in 2023 was $402 million, an increase of $113 million, or 39%, from 2022. The increase in provision expense over the prior year was driven by a combination of loan and lease growth and modest overall ACL coverage ratio builds throughout 2023 that is reflective of the current macroeconomic environment. 

The components of the provision for credit losses were as follows: 

##TABLE_START Table 4 - Provision for Credit Losses Year Ended December 31, (dollar amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Provision for loan and lease losses $ 407 $ 212 $ (1) Provision for unfunded lending commitments (5) 73 26 Provision for securities &#8212; 4 &#8212; Total provision for credit losses $ 402 $ 289 $ 25 ##TABLE_END

Noninterest Income 

The following table reflects noninterest income for each of the periods presented:

2023 noninterest income was $1.9 billion, a decrease of $60 million, or 3%, from the prior year. Gain on sale of loans decreased $43 million, or 75%, primarily resulting from the strategic decision to retain the guaranteed portion of SBA loans at origination. Customer deposit and loan fees decreased $38 million, or 11%, primarily due to program changes and a reduction in loan commitment fees. Mortgage banking income decreased $35 million, or 24%, primarily reflecting lower secondary marketing spreads and lower salable volume. Capital markets and advisory fees decreased $17 million, or 6%, primarily due to lower interest rate derivative and trading fees, partially offset by an increase in advisory fees. Partially offsetting these decreases, other noninterest income increased $37 million, or 86%, primarily due to a $57 million gain on the sale of our RPS business, including associated goodwill allocation, partially offset by $24 million of unfavorable mark-to-market related to the pay-fixed swaptions program. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $28 million, or 9%, primarily due to an increase in annuity commissions. Payments and cash management revenue increased $24 million, or 4%, primarily due to higher debit and credit card transaction revenue. 

2023 Form 10-K 51 

2022 noninterest income was $2.0 billion, an increase of $92 million, or 5%, from the prior year. Capital markets and advisory fees increased $109 million, or 70%, primarily reflecting higher advisory fees supported by the impact of Capstone Partners acquisition, in addition to an increase in syndication, foreign exchange, and interest rate derivative fees. Payments and cash management revenue increased $60 million, or 12%, primarily due to the full-period impact on volume due to TCF customers, partially offset by program changes. Gain on sale of loans increased $48 million primarily due to sales of SBA loans during the first through third quarters of 2022. Customer deposit and loan fees increased $40 million, or 13%, primarily due to the full-period impact on volume due to TCF customers, partially offset by the impact from program changes. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $31 million, or 12%, primarily due to the full-period impact of the TCF acquisition and an increase in sales. Leasing revenue increased $27 million, or 27%, primarily due to the full-period impact of the TCF acquisition. Partially offsetting these decreases, mortgage banking income decreased $165 million, or 53%, primarily reflecting lower salable volume and secondary marketing spreads and bank owned life insurance decreased $13 million, or 19%, primarily due to valuation adjustments and lower benefit claims. 

##TABLE_START Noninterest Expense The following table reflects noninterest expense for each of the periods presented:

Noninterest expense was $4.6 billion, an increase of $373 million, or 9%, from the prior year. Deposit and other insurance expense increased $235 million primarily due to the FDIC DIF special assessment of $214 million and the 2 basis point higher base assessment rate enacted for the banking industry at the beginning of 2023. Personnel costs increased $128 million, or 5%, primarily due to $52 million of expense related to staffing efficiency initiatives, the impact of merit increases, and the impact of the Capstone Partners acquisition, partially offset by $8 million of acquisition-related expenses recognized in the prior year. Marketing expense increased $24 million, or 26%, primarily reflecting actions taken to deepen and acquire new customer relationships. Professional services expense increased $22 million, or 29%, primarily due to an increase in consulting fees related to regulatory and scale initiatives. Partially offsetting these increases, lease financing equipment depreciation decreased $18 million, or 40%, and outside data processing and other services decreased $5 million, or 1%, primarily due to a decrease of $41 million in acquisition-related expenses, partially offset by higher technology investments. Net occupancy remained unchanged as corporate real estate and branch consolidation expenses and a decrease in gain on sale of fixed assets were offset by $32 million in acquisition-related expenses recognized in the prior year.

Provision for Income Taxes 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 1 - &#8220; Significant Accounting Policies &#8221; and Note 18 - &#8220; Income Taxes &#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

The provision for income taxes was $413 million for 2023, compared with $515 million in 2022. The effective tax rates for 2023 and 2022 were 17.3% and 18.6%, respectively. Both years included the benefits from general business credits, tax-exempt income, tax-exempt bank owned life insurance income and investments in qualified affordable housing projects. The decrease in the effective tax rate was largely due to lower pretax income, higher general business credits and an increase in discrete tax benefits, partially offset by capital losses recognized in 2022. 

The net federal deferred tax asset was $616 million, and the net state deferred tax asset was $94 million at December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no valuation allowance on federal deferred taxes. In 2023, a decrease of $1 million in the provision for state income taxes, net of federal tax effect, was recorded for the portion of state deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized, compared to a decrease of $3 million, net of federal tax effect, in 2022. 

RISK MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL 

Risk Governance 

Risk awareness, identification and assessment, reporting, and active management are key elements in overall risk management. Controls include, among other, effective segregation of duties, access management, and authorization and reconciliation procedures, as well as staff education and a disciplined assessment process. 

We use a multi-faceted approach to risk governance. It begins with the Board of Directors, which has defined our risk appetite as aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle. This does not preclude engagement in select higher risk activities. Rather, the definition is intended to represent an aggregate view of where we want our overall risk to be managed. 

Three Board committees primarily oversee implementation and monitoring of the risk appetite: 

&#8226; Our Risk Oversight Committee assists the Board in overseeing management of material risks, the approval and monitoring of our capital position and plan that aligns to our overall aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle risk appetite, the risk governance structure, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and determining adherence to the board&#8217;s stated risk appetite. The ROC has oversight responsibility of our key risk exposures: credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational, strategic, and reputational. Both our Chief Risk Officer and Credit Review Director report directly to the ROC. This committee also oversees our capital management and planning process, ensures that the amount and quality of capital are adequate in relation to expected and unexpected risks, and that our capital levels exceed &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; requirements. 

&#8226; Our Technology Committee assists our Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to all technology and cybersecurity strategies and plans. The Technology Committee is charged with evaluating Huntington&#8217;s capability to properly perform all technology functions necessary for its business plan, including projected growth, technology capacity, planning, operational execution, product development, and management capacity. Our Technology Committee provides oversight of technology investments and plans to drive efficiency as well as to meet defined standards for risk, information security, and redundancy. Our Technology Committee oversees the allocation of technology costs and ensures that they are understood by the Board. Our Technology Committee monitors and evaluates innovation and technology trends that may affect our strategic plans, including monitoring of overall industry trends. The Technology Committee reviews and provides oversight of our continuity and disaster recovery planning and preparedness. 

2023 Form 10-K 53 

&#8226; Our Audit Committee oversees the integrity of the consolidated financial statements, including policies, procedures, and practices regarding the preparation of financial statements, the financial reporting process, disclosures, and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee also provides assistance to our Board in overseeing the internal audit department and the independent registered public accounting firm&#8217;s qualifications and independence; compliance with our Financial Code of Ethics for the chief executive officer and senior financial officers; compliance with corporate securities trading policies; compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; and financial risk exposures in coordination with the ROC. 

Our Audit and Risk Oversight Committees routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in accounting and risk management. On a periodic basis, the two committees meet in joint session to cover matters relevant to both, such as the construct and appropriateness of the ACL, which is reviewed quarterly. All directors have access to information provided to each committee and all scheduled meetings are open to all directors. 

Our Risk Oversight and Technology Committees hold joint sessions to cover matters relevant to both such as cybersecurity and IT risk and control projects and risk assessments. 

Further, through our Human Resources and Compensation Committee, our Board seeks to ensure its overall compensation programs are balanced and align the interests of management, creditors, and shareholders. We utilize a variety of compensation-related tools to induce appropriate behavior, including common stock ownership thresholds for the chief executive officer and certain members of senior management, equity deferrals, recoupment provisions, and the right to terminate compensation plans at any time. 

Management has implemented an Enterprise Risk Management and Risk Appetite Framework. Critically important is our self-assessment process, in which each first-line business segment produces an analysis of its risks and the strength of its risk controls. The segment analyses are combined with assessments by our second-line risk management organization of major risk sectors (e.g., credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic, and reputation) to produce an overall enterprise risk assessment. Outcomes of the process include a determination of the quality of the overall control environment, the direction of risk, and our position compared to the Board&#8217;s defined risk appetite. 

Management also utilizes a wide range of metrics (key risk indicators) to monitor risk positions throughout the Company. In general, thresholds for each metric are established, which allows the Company to operate within an aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle risk appetite. Deviations from the thresholds will indicate if the risk being measured exceeds desired tolerance, which may then necessitate corrective action. 

We also have executive level committees to manage and oversee risk, including: ALCO, Credit Policy and Strategy, Risk Management, and Capital Management. Each committee focuses on specific categories of risk and is supported by a series of subcommittees that are tactical in nature. We believe this structure helps ensure appropriate escalation of issues and overall communication of strategies. 

Huntington utilizes three lines of defense with regard to risk management: (1) business segments, (2) corporate risk management, and (3) internal audit and credit review. To induce greater ownership of risk within our business segments, segment risk officers have been embedded in the business to identify and monitor risk, elevate and remediate issues, establish controls, perform self-testing, and oversee the self-assessment process. Corporate Risk Management establishes policies, sets operating limits, reviews new or modified products/processes, oversees first-line risk-taking activity, and produces the enterprise risk assessment. The Chief Risk Officer has significant input into the design and outcome of incentive compensation plans. Internal audit and credit review provide additional assurance that risk-related functions are operating as intended. 

Huntington classifies/aggregates risk into seven risk pillars. Huntington recognizes that risks can be interrelated or embedded within each other, and therefore managing across risk pillars is a key component of the framework. The following defines the Company&#8217;s risk pillars: 

&#8226; Credit risk , which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms; 

&#8226; Market risk , which occurs when fluctuations in interest rates impact earnings and capital. Financial impacts are realized through changes in the interest rates of balance sheet assets and liabilities (net interest margin) or directly through valuation changes of capitalized MSR and/or trading assets (noninterest income); 

54 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

&#8226; Liquidity risk , which is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due. Liquidity risk includes the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels. Liquidity risk also results from the failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect our ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value; 

&#8226; Operational risk , which is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, including information security breaches or cyberattacks, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. Operational losses result from internal fraud, external fraud, inadequate or inappropriate employment practices and workplace safety, failure to meet professional obligations involving customers, products, and business practices, damage to physical assets, business disruption and systems failures, and failures in execution, delivery, and process management; 

&#8226; Compliance risk , which exposes us to money penalties, enforcement actions, or other sanctions as a result of non-conformance with laws, rules, and regulations that apply to the financial services industry; 

&#8226; Strategic risk , which is defined as risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or enterprise value arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of business decisions or lack of responsiveness to industry / market changes; and 

&#8226; Reputation risk , which is the risk that negative publicity regarding an institution&#8217;s business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions. 

A comprehensive discussion of risk management and capital matters affecting us can be found in the Risk Factors section included in Item 1A: Risk Factors and the &#8220; Regulatory Matters &#8221; section of Item 1: Business of this Form 10-K. 

Some of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit, market, liquidity, operational, and compliance risks are described in the following sections. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation. The majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending. We also have credit risk associated with our investment securities portfolios (see Note 4 - " Investment Securities and Other Securities " of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) . We engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing, asset and liability management, mortgage banking, and trading activities. A variety of derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, caps, swaptions, swaption collars, floors, forward contracts, and forward starting interest rate swaps are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements. We also use derivatives, principally loan sale commitments, in hedging our mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale. While there is credit risk associated with derivative activity, we believe this exposure is minimal. (See Note 1 - " Significant Accounting Policies " of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

We focus on the early identification, monitoring, and management of all aspects of our credit risk. In addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes, market risk management activities, and portfolio diversification, we use quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources, enhanced modeling technology, and internal stress testing processes. Our ongoing expansion of portfolio management resources is central to our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle risk appetite. In our efforts to identify risk mitigation techniques, we have focused on product design features, origination policies, and solutions for delinquent or stressed borrowers. 

2023 Form 10-K 55 

The maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers. Authority to grant commitments sits with the independent credit administration function, with limited exceptions, and is closely monitored and regularly updated. Concentration risk is managed through limits on loan type, industry, and loan quality factors. We focus predominantly on extending credit to consumer and commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets, although we will consider lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives. Although we offer a broad set of products, we continue to develop new lending products and opportunities. Each of these new products and opportunities goes through a rigorous development and approval process prior to implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low risk portfolio profile. 

The checks and balances in the credit process and the separation of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted, facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur, and provide for effective problem asset management and resolution. For example, we do not extend additional credit to delinquent borrowers except in certain circumstances that substantially improve our overall repayment or collateral coverage position. 

Loan and Lease Credit Exposure Mix 

At December 31, 2023, our loans and leases totaled $122.0 billion, representing a $2.5 billion, or 2%, increase compared to $119.5 billion at December 31, 2022. 

The table below provides the composition of our total loan and lease portfolio: &#160;

56 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

Total commercial loans and leases were $68.3 billion at December 31, 2023 and represented 56% of our total loan and lease credit exposure at that date. Our commercial loan portfolio is diversified by product type, customer size, and geography, and is comprised of the following ( see Commercial Credit discussion) : 

C&#38;I &#8211; C&#38;I loans are made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases, or other projects, and to institutional sponsors supporting REITs. We focus on borrowers doing business within our geographic markets. C&#38;I loans are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company and/or the personal guarantee of the business owners. The financing of owner-occupied facilities is considered a C&#38;I loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral. This treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The operation, sale, rental, or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary repayment source for these types of loans. As we have expanded our C&#38;I portfolio, we have developed a series of &#8220;vertical specialties&#8221; to ensure that new products or lending types are embedded within a structured, centralized Commercial Lending area with designated, experienced credit officers. These specialties are comprised of either targeted industries (for example, healthcare, technology &#38; telecom, finance and insurance, etc.) and/or lending disciplines (equipment finance, distribution finance, asset-based lending, etc.), all of which requires a high degree of expertise and oversight to effectively mitigate and monitor risk. As such, we have dedicated colleagues and teams focused on bringing value-added expertise to these specialty customers. 

CRE &#8211; The CRE portfolio includes both CRE commercial and CRE construction loans. CRE commercial loans are loans to developers. We mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement. These loans are made to finance properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers, and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale, or refinance of the property. Appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination and updated on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements and our credit policies. CRE construction loans are loans to developers, companies, or individuals used for the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing of the property. Our CRE construction portfolio primarily consists of multi-family, retail, and warehouse property types. Generally, these loans are for construction projects that have been pre-sold or pre-leased, or have secured permanent financing, as well as loans to real estate companies with significant equity invested in each project. These loans are managed by a specialized real estate lending group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction schedule. 

Lease Financing &#8211; Lease financing products are designed to address the diverse financing needs of small to large companies primarily for the acquisition of equipment. Our lease financing portfolio will utilize a variety of origination partners and third-party sources including equipment manufacturers, dealers, or vendors set up under program structures to generate transactions from a nationwide footprint. High level business lines comprise of industrial finance, specialty finance, healthcare finance, technology finance, and specialized transportation, franchise, &#38; government. 

2023 Form 10-K 57 

Total consumer loans were $53.7 billion at December 31, 2023 and represented 44% of our total loan and lease credit exposure at that date. The consumer portfolio is comprised primarily of residential mortgages, automobile loans, home equity loans and lines-of-credit, and RV and marine finance (see Consumer Credit discussion) . 

Residential mortgage &#8211; Residential mortgage loans represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence. These loans are generally financed over a 15-year to 30-year term, and in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. Applications are underwritten centrally using consistent credit policies and processes. All residential mortgage loan decisions utilize a full appraisal for collateral valuation. Huntington has not originated or acquired residential mortgages that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options. 

Automobile &#8211; Automobile loans are comprised primarily of loans made through automotive dealerships and include exposure in selected states outside of our primary banking markets. The exposure outside of our core footprint states represents 17% of the total exposure, with no individual state representing more than 6%. Applications are underwritten using an automated underwriting system that applies consistent policies and processes across the portfolio. 

Home equity &#8211; Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines-of-credit. This type of lending, which is secured by a first-lien or junior-lien on the borrower&#8217;s residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home or refinance existing mortgage debt. Products include closed-end loans which are generally fixed-rate with principal and interest payments, and variable-rate, interest-only lines-of-credit which do not require payment of principal during the 10-year revolving period. The home equity line of credit converts to a 20-year amortizing structure at the end of the revolving period. Applications are underwritten centrally in conjunction with an automated underwriting system. The home equity underwriting criteria is based on minimum credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, and LTV ratios, with current collateral valuations. The underwriting for the floating rate lines of credit also incorporates a stress analysis for rising interest rates. 

RV and marine &#8211; RV and marine loans are loans provided to consumers for the purpose of financing recreational vehicles and boats. Loans are originated on an indirect basis through a series of dealerships across 35 states. The loans are underwritten centrally using an application and decisioning system similar to automobile loans. The current portfolio includes 24% of the balances within our core footprint states. 

Other consumer &#8211; Other consumer loans primarily consists of consumer loans not secured by real estate, including credit cards, personal unsecured loans, and overdraft balances. We originate these products within our established set of credit policies and guidelines. 

Our loan and lease portfolio is a managed mix of consumer and commercial credits. We manage the overall credit exposure and portfolio composition via a credit concentration policy. The policy designates specific loan types, collateral types, and loan structures to be formally tracked and assigned maximum exposure limits as a percentage of capital. Commercial lending by NAICS categories, specific limits for CRE project types, loans secured by residential real estate, large dollar exposures, and designated high risk loan categories represent examples of specifically tracked components of our concentration management process. There are no identified concentrations that exceed the assigned exposure limit. Our concentration management policy is approved by the ROC and is used to ensure a high quality, well diversified portfolio that is consistent with our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle risk appetite. Changes to existing concentration limits, incorporating specific information relating to the potential impact on the overall portfolio composition and performance metrics, require the approval of the ROC prior to implementation.

Commercial Credit 

The primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower, assessment of the borrower&#8217;s management capabilities, cash flows from operations, industry sector trends, type and sufficiency of collateral, type of exposure, transaction structure, and the general economic outlook. While these are the primary factors considered, there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process. We require the signature approval of both the appropriate line of business leaders and independent credit executives. The risk rating, credit exposure amount, and complexity of the credit determines the threshold for approval. Credit officers who understand each local region and are experienced in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and have the primary credit authority, with the exception of small business loans. For small business loans, we utilize a centralized loan approval process for standard products and structures. In this centralized decision environment, certain individuals who understand each local region may make credit-extension decisions to preserve our commitment to the communities in which we operate. In addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors, a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan. 

In commercial lending, on-going credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan. We monitor all significant exposures. All commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrower&#8217;s PD and LGD. This two-dimensional rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio management process. The PD is rated and applied at the borrower level. The LGD is rated and applied based on the specific type of credit extension and the quality and lien position associated with the underlying collateral. The internal risk ratings are assessed at origination and updated at each periodic monitoring event. There is also extensive macro-portfolio management analysis. We review and adjust our risk-rating criteria based on actual experience, which provides us with the current risk level in the portfolio. A centralized portfolio management function monitors and reports on the performance of the entire commercial portfolio, including small business loans, to provide consistent oversight. 

In addition to the initial credit analysis conducted during the approval process, our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and risk of new loan originations. This group is part of our Risk Management area and conducts portfolio reviews on a risk-based cycle to evaluate individual loans, validate risk ratings, and test the consistency of credit processes. 

Our standardized loan grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment, one of which is guarantor support. On an at least annual basis, we consider, among other things, the guarantor&#8217;s reputation and creditworthiness, where available, along with various key financial metrics such as liquidity and net worth. Our assessment of the guarantor&#8217;s credit strength, or lack thereof, is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans, which is directly tied to, and an integral component of, our ACL methodology. When a loan goes to impaired status, viable guarantor support is considered in the determination of a credit loss. 

If our assessment of the guarantor&#8217;s credit strength yields an inherent capacity to perform, we will seek repayment from the guarantor as part of the collection process and have done so successfully. 

Substantially all loans categorized as Classified (See Note 5 - &#8220; Loans and Leases &#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are managed by FRG. FRG is a specialized group of credit professionals that handle the day-to-day management of workouts, commercial recoveries, and problem loan sales. Its responsibilities include developing and implementing action plans, assessing risk ratings, and determining the appropriateness of the allowance, the accrual status, and the ultimate collectability of the Classified loan portfolio. 

C&#38;I PORTFOLIO 

We manage the risks inherent in the C&#38;I portfolio through origination policies, a defined loan concentration policy with established limits, on-going loan-level and portfolio-level reviews, recourse requirements, and continuous portfolio risk management activities. Our origination policies for the C&#38;I portfolio include loan product-type specific policies such as LTV and debt service coverage ratios, as applicable. 

60 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

The C&#38;I portfolio continues to have solid origination activity while we maintain a focus on high quality originations. We continue to maintain a proactive approach to identifying borrowers that may be facing financial difficulty in order to maximize the potential credit outcomes. Subsequent to the origination of the loan, the credit review group provides an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and risk of new loan originations. 

CRE PORTFOLIO 

We manage the risks inherent in this portfolio specific to CRE lending, focusing on the quality of the developer and the specifics associated with each project. Generally, we: (1) limit our loans to 80% of the appraised value of the commercial real estate at origination, (2) require net operating cash flows to be 120% of required interest and principal payments, and (3) if the commercial real estate is non-owner occupied, require that pre-leasing generates break-even interest-only debt service. We actively monitor property-type concentrations and both geographic and property-type performance metrics of all CRE loan types, with a focus on loans identified as higher risk based on the risk rating methodology. Both macro-level and loan-level stress-test scenarios based on existing and forecast market conditions are part of the on-going portfolio management process for the CRE portfolio. 

Dedicated real estate professionals originate and manage the portfolio. The portfolio is diversified by property-type and loan size, and this diversification represents a significant portion of the credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio. Subsequent to the origination of the loan, the credit review group provides an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and risk of new loan originations. 

The following tables present our commercial real estate portfolio by property-type and geographic location.

Appraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all originations and renewals, and on an as-needed basis, in compliance with regulatory requirements and to ensure appropriate decisions regarding the on-going management of the portfolio reflect the changing market conditions. Appraisals are obtained from approved vendors and are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group comprised of certified appraisers to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the underwriting process. We continue to perform on-going portfolio level reviews within the CRE portfolio. These reviews generate action plans based on occupancy levels or leasing revenues associated with the projects being reviewed. This highly individualized process requires working closely with all of our borrowers, as well as an in-depth knowledge of CRE project lending and the market environment. 

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work options have led to increased vacancy rates and underutilization of office space across the country. Our office portfolio, which is predominantly suburban and multi-tenant loans, totaled $1.8 billion, or 1%, of total loans and leases, as of December 31, 2023. We have established ACL reserves of approximately 10% for our office portfolio. At December 31, 2023, there was $25 million of outstanding balances in the office portfolio that were 30 or more days past due. 

LEASE FINANCING 

We manage the risks inherent in the Lease Financing portfolio through external consumer and business credit scoring solutions, internally developed custom probability of default and loss given default models, continuous portfolio risk management activities, and equipment and customer diversification. Our origination policies are aligned by transaction size with increased use of the personal guarantee of principals and external credit scoring tools for smaller transactions and expanded financial analysis and reporting requirements for larger transactions. Our program focuses on high-quality manufacturer, distributor, vendor, or third party originations sources with in-depth partner diligence. The lease financing group may use manufacturer loss risk share programs that provide additional transaction support, but the origination strategy prioritizes strong customer financial condition. 

High level business lines are comprised of Industrial Finance, Specialty Finance, Healthcare Finance, Technology Finance, and Specialized Transportation, Franchise, and Government with multiple segments under each main line. We also have specific equipment types or industries designated as low tolerance with additional front-end guidance and diligence requirements. Subsequent to the origination of the lease, the credit review group provides an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and risk of new lease originations. 

Consumer Credit 

Consumer credit approvals are based on, among other factors, the financial strength and payment history of the borrower, type of exposure, and transaction structure. Consumer credit decisions are generally made in a centralized environment utilizing decision models. Importantly, certain individuals who understand each local region have the authority to make credit extension decisions to preserve our focus on the local communities in which we operate. For all classes within the consumer loan portfolio, loans are assigned pool level PD factors based on the FICO range within which the borrower&#8217;s credit bureau score falls. The credit bureau score is widely accepted as the standard measure of consumer credit risk used by lenders, regulators, rating agencies, and consumers. The LGD is related to the type of collateral associated with the credit extension, which typically does not change over the course of the loan term. This allows Huntington to maintain a current view of the customer for credit risk management and ACL purposes. 

In consumer lending, credit risk is managed from a segment (i.e., loan type, collateral position, geography, etc.) and vintage performance analysis. All portfolio segments are continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and other asset quality indicators. We make extensive use of portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality of the portfolio, which may result in changes to future origination strategies. The credit review group conducts ongoing independent credit origination and process reviews to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the consumer credit processes. 

Collection actions by our customer assistance team are initiated as needed through a centrally managed collection and recovery function. We employ a series of collection methodologies designed to maintain a high level of effectiveness, while maximizing efficiency. In addition to the consumer loan portfolio, the customer assistance team is responsible for collection activity on all sold and securitized consumer loans and leases. Collection practices include a single contact point for the majority of the residential real estate secured portfolios.

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE SECURED PORTFOLIOS 

The properties securing our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are primarily located within our geographic footprint. Huntington continues to support our local markets with consistent underwriting across all residential secured products. The residential secured portfolio originations continue to be of high quality. Our portfolio management strategies associated with our Home Savers group allow us to focus on effectively helping our customers with appropriate solutions for their specific circumstances. 

Huntington underwrites all residential mortgage applications centrally, with a focus on higher quality borrowers. We do not originate residential mortgages that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options. Residential mortgages are originated based on a completed full appraisal during the credit underwriting process. We update values in compliance with applicable regulations to facilitate our portfolio management, as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions. 

We are subject to repurchase risk associated with residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market. An appropriate level of reserve for representations and warranties related to residential mortgage loans sold has been established to address this repurchase risk inherent in the portfolio. 

AUTOMOBILE PORTFOLIO 

Our strategy in the automobile portfolio continues to focus on high quality borrowers as measured by both FICO and internal custom scores, combined with appropriate LTVs, terms, and profitability. Our strategy and operational capabilities allow us to appropriately manage the origination quality across the entire portfolio, including our newer markets. Although increased origination volume and entering new markets can be associated with increased risk levels, we believe our disciplined strategy and operational processes significantly mitigate these risks. 

We have continued to consistently execute our value proposition and take advantage of available market opportunities. Importantly, we have maintained our high credit quality standards while also maintaining strong origination volume. 

RV AND MARINE PORTFOLIO 

Our strategy in the RV and Marine portfolio focuses on high quality borrowers, combined with appropriate LTVs, terms, and profitability. Although entering new markets can be associated with increased risk levels, we believe our disciplined strategy and operational processes significantly mitigate these risks. 

Credit Quality 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 5 - &#8220; Loans and Leases and Note 6 - &#8220; Allowance for Credit Losses &#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

We believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance is through an analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: NPAs, NALs, ACL, and NCOs. In addition, we utilize delinquency rates, risk distribution and migration patterns, product segmentation, and origination trends in the analysis of our credit quality performance. 

Credit quality performance in 2023 reflected NCOs of $273 million, or 0.23%, of average total loans and leases, an increase from $121 million, or 0.11%, in the prior year, driven by an $143 million increase in Commercial NCOs. NPAs increased $117 million, or 20%, to $711 million, primarily driven by increases in commercial and industrial and commercial real estate NALs. 

NPAs and NALs 

NPAs consist of (1) NALs, which represent loans and leases no longer accruing interest, (2) OREO properties, and (3) other NPAs. Any loan or lease in our portfolio may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to the policies described below when collection of principal or interest is in doubt. Also, when a borrower with discharged non-reaffirmed debt in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy is identified and the loan or lease is determined to be collateral dependent, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status. 

2023 Form 10-K 63 

Commercial loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status at 90-days past due, or earlier if repayment of principal and interest is in doubt. Of the $498 million of commercial related NALs at December 31, 2023, $260 million, or 52%, represent loans and leases that were less than 30-days past due, demonstrating our continued commitment to proactive credit risk management. With the exception of residential mortgage loans guaranteed by government organizations which continue to accrue interest, first lien loans secured by residential mortgage collateral are placed on nonaccrual status at 150-days past due. Junior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at the earlier of 120-days past due or when the related first-lien loan has been identified as nonaccrual. Automobile, RV and marine, and other consumer loans are generally fully charged-off at 120-days past due, and if not fully charged-off are placed on non-accrual. 

When loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual, any accrued interest is reversed against interest income. When, in our judgment, the borrower&#8217;s ability to make required interest and principal payments has resumed and collectability is no longer in doubt, the loan or lease could be returned to accrual status. 

The following table reflects period-end NALs and NPAs detail: 

##TABLE_START Table 11 - Nonaccrual Loans and Leases and Nonperforming Assets At December 31, (dollar amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Nonaccrual loans and leases (NALs): Commercial and industrial $ 344 $ 288 Commercial real estate 140 92 Lease financing 14 18 Residential mortgage 72 90 Automobile 4 4 Home equity 91 76 RV and marine 2 1 Total nonaccrual loans and leases 667 569 Other real estate, net 10 11 Other NPAs (1) 34 14 Total nonperforming assets $ 711 $ 594 Nonaccrual loans and leases as a % of total loans and leases 0.55 % 0.48 % NPA ratio (2) 0.58 0.50 ##TABLE_END

(1) Other nonperforming assets include certain impaired investment securities and/or nonaccrual loans held-for-sale. 

(2) Nonperforming assets divided by the sum of loans and leases, other real estate owned, and other NPAs. 

ACL 

Our ACL is comprised of two different components, both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb lifetime expected credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio: the ALLL and the AULC. 

We use statistically-based models that employ assumptions about current and future economic conditions throughout the contractual life of the loan. The process of estimating expected credit losses is based on three key parameters: PD, EAD, and LGD. Beyond the reasonable and supportable period (two to three years), the economic variables revert to a historical equilibrium at a pace dependent on the state of the economy reflected within the economic scenario. 

64 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

Future economic conditions consider multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party and are reviewed through the Allowance for Credit Loss Development Methodology Committee described below. These macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables that are influential to our modeling process, the most significant being unemployment rates and GDP. The probability weights assigned to each scenario are generally expected to be consistent from period to period. Any changes in probability weights must be supported by appropriate documentation and approval of senior management. Additionally, we consider whether to adjust the modeled estimates to address possible limitations within the models or factors not captured within the macroeconomic scenarios. Lifetime losses for most of our loans and leases are evaluated collectively based on similar risk characteristics, risk ratings, origination credit bureau scores, delinquency status, and remaining months within loan agreements, among other factors. 

The baseline scenario used for the 2023 fourth quarter assumes softening of the labor market is underway and will continue through early 2025 causing the unemployment rate to gradually increase, peaking at 4.1% in the first quarter of 2025 before marginally improving to 3.9% by 2027. The overnight federal funds rate is forecasted to have peaked during the third quarter of 2023, remaining at this terminal level until mid-2024 as the Federal Reserve continues to address inflation levels and tightness in the labor market. The Federal Reserve is expected to start cutting rates in the third quarter of 2024 at a rate of 25 basis points per quarter until reaching 3% in late 2026. Inflation is forecasted to drop from 3.3% year over year at the end of 2023 to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s target rate of 2% by the fourth quarter of 2024. The GDP forecast for 2024 has fallen from prior year end, a result of elevated interest rates and tightening credit conditions over the past year. GDP is now forecasted to be 1.5% by the fourth quarter of 2024. 

Management uses a probability-weighted approach that incorporates a baseline, an adverse and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate for the allowance. The table below is intended to show how the forecasted path of unemployment and GDP in the baseline scenario has changed between those used in the year 2022 and 2023 ACL determination: 

##TABLE_START Table 12 - Forecasted Key Macroeconomic Variables 2022 2023 2024 Baseline scenario forecast Q4 Q2 Q4 Q2 Q4 Unemployment rate (1) 4Q 2022 3.7% 3.9% 4.1% 4.1% 3.9% 4Q 2023 N/A N/A 3.8 3.9 4.0 Gross Domestic Product (1) 4Q 2022 (0.1)% 0.4% 2.0% 2.3% 2.7% 4Q 2023 N/A N/A 0.8 1.2 1.5 ##TABLE_END

(1) Values reflect the baseline scenario forecast inputs for each period presented, not updated for subsequent actual amounts. 

Management continues to assess the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, including ongoing risks in the commercial real estate environment, current inflation levels, political uncertainty, and geopolitical instability, considering multiple macroeconomic forecasts that reflected a range of possible outcomes. While we have incorporated estimates of economic uncertainty into our ACL, the ultimate impact of specific challenges in the commercial real estate industry, recent inflation levels, higher interest rates, and the significant conflicts on-going around the world will have on the economy remains unknown. 

Management develops additional analytics to support adjustments to our modeled results. Our Allowance for Credit Loss Development Methodology Committee reviewed model results of each economic scenario for appropriate usage, concluding that the quantitative transaction reserve will continue to utilize scenario weighting. Given the uncertainty associated with key economic scenario assumptions, the December 31, 2023 ACL included a general reserve that consists of various risk profile components, including profiles to capture uncertainty not addressed within the quantitative transaction reserve. 

2023 Form 10-K 65 

Our Allowance for Credit Loss Development Methodology Committee is responsible for developing the methodology, assumptions and estimates used in the calculation, as well as determining the appropriateness of the ACL. The ALLL represents the estimate of lifetime expected losses in the loan and lease portfolio at the reported date. The loss modeling process uses an EAD concept to calculate total expected losses on both funded balances and unfunded lending commitments, where appropriate. Losses related to the unfunded lending commitments are then recorded as AULC within other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. A liability for expected credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recognized if Huntington has a present contractual obligation to extend the credit and the obligation is not unconditionally cancelable. 

The AULC is determined by applying the same quantitative reserve determination process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable funding expectation. (See Note 1 - " Significant Accounting Policies " of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). 

Our ACL evaluation process includes the on-going assessment of credit quality metrics, and a comparison of certain ACL benchmarks to current performance. For further information, including the ALLL and AULC activity by portfolio segment, refer to Note 6 - &#8220; Allowance for Credit Losses &#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The table below reflects the allocation of our ALLL among our various loan and lease categories as well as certain coverage metrics of the reported ALLL and ACL: &#160;

(1) Percentages represent the percentage of each loan and lease category to total loans and leases. 

At December 31, 2023, the ACL was $2.4 billion, or 1.97%, of total loans and leases, compared to $2.3 billion, or 1.90%, at December 31, 2022. The increase in the total ACL was primarily driven by a combination of loan and lease growth and modest overall coverage ratio builds throughout 2023. The ACL coverage ratio at December 31, 2023 is reflective of the current macro-economic environment.

NCOs 

A loan in any portfolio may be charged-off prior to the policies described below if a loss confirming event has occurred. Loss confirming events include, but are not limited to, bankruptcy (unsecured), continued delinquency, foreclosure, or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency where that asset is the sole source of repayment. Additionally, discharged, collateral dependent non-reaffirmed debt in Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings will result in a charge-off to estimated collateral value, less anticipated selling costs at the time of discharge. 

Commercial loans and leases are either charged-off or written down to net realizable value by 90-days past due with the exception of administrative small ticket lease delinquencies. Automobile loans, RV and marine, and other consumer loans are generally fully charged-off at 120-days past due. First-lien and junior-lien home equity loans are charged-off to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less anticipated selling costs, at 150-days past due and 120-days past due, respectively. Residential mortgages are charged-off to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less anticipated selling costs, at 150-days past due. The remaining balance is in delinquent status until a modification can be completed, or the loan goes through the foreclosure process. 

The following table reflects NCO detail:

NCOs were 0.23% of average loans and leases in 2023, up from 0.11% in 2022. NCOs for commercial loans and leases were higher, with net charge-offs of 0.23% in 2023 compared to 0.03% in 2022, driven by increases in both commercial and industrial and commercial real estate portfolios and reflecting the continued normalization of net charge-offs. Consumer net charge-offs were modestly higher in 2023 compared to 2022, with increases in the automobile and RV and marine portfolios partially offset by lower NCOs in other consumer loans. 

Market Risk 

Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, including the correlation among these factors and their volatility. When the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors, the holder faces market risk. We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers, and secondarily, to price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, equity investments, and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans. 

We measure market risk exposure via financial simulation models, which provide management with insights on the potential impact to net interest income and other key metrics as a result of changes in market interest rates. Models are used to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of the balance sheet based on assumptions regarding the slope or shape of the yield curve, the direction and volatility of interest rates, and the changing composition and characteristics of the balance sheet resulting from strategic objectives and customer behavior. Our models incorporate market-based assumptions that include the impact of changing interest rates on prepayment rates of assets and runoff of deposits. The models also include our projections of the future volume and pricing of various business lines. 

In measuring the financial risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in our balance sheet, we compare a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates. The market forward rates reflect the market consensus regarding the future level and slope of the yield curve across a range of tenor points. The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes two types: &#8220;shock&#8221; scenarios which are immediate parallel rate shifts, and &#8220;ramp&#8221; scenarios where the parallel shift is applied gradually over the first 12 months of the forecast on a pro rata basis. In both shock and ramp scenarios with falling rates, we presume that market rates will not go below 0%. The scenarios are inclusive of all executed interest rate risk hedging activities. Forward starting hedges are included to the extent that they have been transacted and that they start within the measurement horizon. 

A key driver of our interest rate risk profile is our interest-bearing deposit repricing sensitivity assumptions to changes in interest rates, otherwise known as deposit beta. In addition, our interest expense is impacted by the composition of both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits in relation to our total deposits. Accordingly, we consider the impacts from both interest-bearing and noninterest bearing deposits on our total deposit beta. Our cumulative to-date total deposit beta (total cost of deposits) is 41% within the current rate cycle, which started in March 2022. 

Interest rate risk is measured across a range of scenarios and the results are reported to the ROC at least quarterly. A comprehensive discussion of risk management governance can be found in Item 7: Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the &#8220; Risk Governance &#8221; section of this Form 10-K. 

We use two approaches to model interest rate risk: Net interest income at risk (NII at risk) and economic value of equity at risk modeling sensitivity analysis (EVE at Risk). 

NII at Risk is used by management to measure the risk and impact to earnings over the next 12 months, using a variety of interest rate scenarios. The NII at Risk results included in the table below reflect the analysis used monthly by management. It models gradual &#8220;ramp&#8221; -200, -100, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shift scenarios implied by the forward yield curve over the next 12 months.

The NII at Risk shows that the balance sheet is asset sensitive at both December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The primary drivers to the change in sensitivity during 2023 include changes in the projected composition and characteristics of the balance sheet, pricing assumptions, hedging activity, and the evolution of market rates over the next 12 months. 

EVE at Risk is used by management to measure the impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures. The EVE results included in the table below reflect the analysis used monthly by management. It models immediate -200, -100, +100 and +200 basis point parallel &#8220;shock&#8221; scenarios from the yield curve term points at the specific point in time that EVE sensitivity is measured.

The change in sensitivity from December 31, 2022 was driven primarily by changes in the composition and characteristics of the balance sheet, routine enhancements to deposit and prepayment modeling assumptions, changes in hedging activity aligned with interest rate risk positioning through macroeconomic cycles, and market rates. 

To address the discontinuance of LIBOR, we established a LIBOR transition team and project plan under the oversight of the CRO and CFO, providing periodic updates to the ROC. Contract remediation efforts coordinated by the LIBOR transition team were complete as of June 2023. Upon the discontinuation of LIBOR, loans and leases that referenced LIBOR were transitioned to a SOFR-based replacement rate as set forth in the related contract. For further details on the transition of notional derivatives, refer to the Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk section below. 

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk 

An integral component of our interest rate risk management strategy is the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that we may use as part of our interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, caps and floors, collars, forward contracts, and forward starting interest rate swaps. 

Table 17 shows all swap, swaption, swaption collar and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing our exposures to the variability of interest rates. The interest rates variability may impact either the fair value of the assets and liabilities or impact the cash flows attributable to net interest margin. These positions are used to protect the fair value of asset and liabilities by converting the contractual interest rate on a specified amount of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. The positions are also used to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate by converting the variable rate index into a fixed rate. The volume, maturity, and mix of derivative positions change frequently as we adjust our broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 20 - &#8220; Derivative Financial Instruments &#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, we purchased interest rate swaptions to reduce the impact on capital from rising rates. These swaptions were economic hedges of interest rate risk attributable to our investment securities with the change in value of these instruments recorded in other noninterest income . We terminated these positions during the 2023 fourth quarter. Cumulatively for the full-year, the net unfavorable mark-to-market on the pay-fixed swaptions program totaled $24 million.

In the second quarter of 2023, all cleared derivatives that referenced LIBOR transitioned from LIBOR to a SOFR-based replacement rate in accordance with the conventions established by the applicable clearinghouse. Upon the discontinuation of LIBOR, all over-the-counter derivatives that referenced LIBOR were transitioned to a SOFR-based replacement rate as set forth in the related contract. Those derivatives that did not have a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate set forth in the related contract used the LIBOR Act to replace LIBOR with a SOFR-based rate established by FRB rulemaking. For every LIBOR referenced instrument with a reset date after the LIBOR cessation date, counterparties received a LIBOR referenced instrument maturing on the first reset date after the LIBOR cessation date, and a forward starting SOFR instrument. The instruments received through the transition were economically similar to the instruments held prior to the transition. 

Use of Derivatives to Manage Credit Risk 

We may utilize credit derivatives as a tool to manage credit risk within the portfolio by purchasing credit protection over certain types of loan products. When we purchase credit protection, such as a CDS, we pay a fee to the seller, or CDS counterparty, in return for the right to receive a payment if a specified credit event occurs. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed a synthetic CRT transaction consisting of a CDS to mitigate credit risk associated with a $3 billion portfolio of on-balance sheet prime indirect auto loans and which benefited our regulatory capital ratios by reducing the RWA on the associated pool of loans by approximately $2.4 billion. 

MSRs 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 7 - &#8220; Mortgage Loan Sales and Servicing Rights &#8221; of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

At December 31, 2023, we had a total of $515 million of capitalized MSRs representing the right to service $33.2 billion in mortgage loans. 

MSR fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be reduced by prepayments and declines in credit quality. Prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise. We also employ hedging strategies to reduce the risk of MSR fair value changes or impairment. However, volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges. We report changes in the MSR value net of hedge-related trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income. 

MSR assets are included in servicing rights and other intangible assets in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Price Risk 

Price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting. We have price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, derivative instruments, and equity investments. We have established loss limits on the trading portfolio, on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained, and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held. 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk is the possibility of us being unable to meet current and future financial obligations in a timely manner. The goal of liquidity management is to ensure adequate, stable, reliable, and cost-effective sources of funds to satisfy changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals, investment opportunities, and other contractual obligations. We consider core earnings, strong capital ratios, and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings, which allows us cost-effective access to market-based liquidity. We mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash, cash equivalents, and securities. In addition, we maintain a large, stable core deposit base and a diversified base of readily available wholesale funding sources, including secured funding sources from the FHLB and Federal Reserve through pledged borrowing capacity, issuance through dealers in the capital markets, and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers. 

2023 Form 10-K 71 

The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing an acceptable level of liquidity risk at Huntington, including approval of the liquidity risk appetite at least annually. The liquidity risk appetite includes certain structural and contingent liquidity risk metrics and limits that are designed and monitored to ensure Huntington maintains adequate liquidity to meet current and future funding needs, including during periods of potential stress. Further, the ALCO is appointed by the ROC to oversee liquidity risk management, including the establishment of liquidity risk policies and additional liquidity risk metrics and limits to support our overall liquidity risk appetite. Liquidity risk appetite metrics monitored by senior management and reported to the Board at least semi-annually include loans as a percentage of core deposits, a structural funding ratio, internal liquidity stress test coverage ratios, and a holding company cash coverage ratio. Additional key liquidity risk metrics monitored by senior management and reported to ALCO monthly include non-core funds (such as brokered deposits and wholesale borrowings) as a percentage of tangible assets, various deposit concentration limits, including large dollar depositor and brokered deposit limits, and varying types of internally defined liquidity coverage ratios, including minimum reserve balances at the FRB and U.S. Treasury holdings relative to internal liquidity stress outflows. Our liquidity risk metric monitoring thresholds are evaluated at a minimum annually, and more frequently if conditions warrant. 

Liquidity risk is managed centrally by Corporate Treasury with independent oversight of liquidity risk performed by Corporate Risk Management. Our liquidity position is evaluated daily, weekly, and monthly by analyzing the composition of all funding sources, reviewing projected liquidity commitments by future months, and identifying sources and uses of funds. The overall management of our liquidity position is also integrated into consumer and commercial pricing policies to ensure a stable core deposit base. Liquidity risk is reviewed and managed continuously for the Bank and the parent company, as well as its subsidiaries. In addition, liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions, provide policy guidance, review funding strategies, and oversee the adherence to, and maintenance of, contingency funding plans. At December 31, 2023, management believes current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet Huntington&#8217;s on and off-balance sheet obligations. 

We maintain a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing, which assesses the potential erosion of funds in the event of an institution-specific event or systemic financial market crisis. Examples of institution specific events could include a downgrade in our public credit rating by a rating agency, a large charge to earnings, declines in profitability or other financial measures, declines in liquidity sources including reductions in deposit balances or access to contingent funding sources, or a significant merger or acquisition. Examples of systemic events unrelated to us that could have an effect on our access to liquidity could include terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, failure of a major financial institution, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund, or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation or rumors about us, or the banking industry in general, may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources. The contingency funding plan, which is reviewed and approved by the ROC at least annually, outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis and provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities and communication protocols for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period and outlines early warning indicators that are used to monitor emerging liquidity stress events. 

Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is core deposits, which provide stable and lower-cost funding. Core deposits were $145.5 billion at December 31, 2023 which comprised 96% of total deposits, compared to $142.1 billion, and 96% of total deposits at December 31, 2022. The $3.3 billion increase in core deposits, compared to December 31, 2022, was primarily driven by an increase in consumer deposits, largely money market and certificates of deposits, partially offset by a decrease in commercial core deposits driven by shifts to off-balance sheet liquidity solutions we provide for our customers. Our core deposits come from a base of primary bank customer relationships, and we continue to focus on acquiring and deepening those relationships resulting in our granular and diversified deposit base. 

Non-core deposits consist primarily of brokered money market balances. Non-core deposits were $5.8 billion, or 4% of total deposits, at both December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Non-core deposits were below our established liquidity risk metric limits at December 31, 2023. 

Insured deposits comprised approximately 70% of our total deposits at December 31, 2023, compared to 68% at December 31, 2022. Throughout 2023, we maintained one of the highest levels of insured deposits amongst banks with more than $100 billion in deposits.

As of December 31, 2023, the Bank Call Report uninsured deposit balance was $49.8 billion, which includes $4.6 billion of inter-company deposits. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank Call Report uninsured deposit balance was $84.6 billion, which includes $37.3 billion of inter-company deposits.

Cash and cash equivalents were $10.1 billion and $6.7 billion at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The $3.4 billion increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to an increase in interest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank to support short-term liquidity. 

Our investment securities portfolio is evaluated under established ALCO objectives. Changing market conditions could affect the profitability of the portfolio, as well as the level of interest rate risk exposure. 

Total investment securities were $41.2 billion at December 31, 2023, compared to $40.5 billion at December 31, 2022. The $686 million increase in securities compared to December 31, 2022, was due to a managed increase in the portfolio through the purchase of U.S. Treasuries, in addition to an increase in fair market value, partially offset by maturities during the year. At December 31, 2023, the duration of the investment securities portfolio was 4.5 years, or 3.7 years net of hedging. Securities are pledged to secure borrowing capacity with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve, discussed further in the Bank Liquidity and Sources of Funding section below. At December 31, 2023, investment securities with market value of $5.8 billion were unpledged.

Our primary sources of funding for the Bank are consumer and commercial core deposits. At December 31, 2023, these core deposits funded 77% of total assets (119% of total loans). To the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits and cash and cash equivalents, we may meet out liquidity needs through wholesale funding and asset securitization or sale. 

The Bank maintains borrowing capacity at both the FHLB and the Federal Reserve secured by pledged loans and securities. The Bank does not consider borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve a primary source of funding, however, it could be used as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. At December 31, 2023, the Bank&#8217;s available contingent borrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal Reserve totaled $83.0 billion, compared to $53.5 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase reflects our optimization of contingent borrowing capacity through the pledge of incremental assets. The amount of available contingent borrowing capacity may fluctuate based on the level of borrowings outstanding and level of assets pledged.

Following the first quarter of 2023 bank failures, the FRB established the BTFP as an additional source of available liquidity to support depository institutions through pledging qualifying assets as collateral. The Bank has taken steps to support readiness but has not participated through December 31, 2023. In January 2024, the FRB announced it will stop extending loans under the BTFP after March 11, 2024. 

At December 31, 2023, we believe the Bank has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.

Parent Company Liquidity 

The parent company&#8217;s funding requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, income taxes, operating expenses, funding of nonbank subsidiaries, repurchases of our stock, and acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet obligations from dividends and interest received from the Bank, interest and dividends received from direct subsidiaries, net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return, fees for services provided to subsidiaries, and the issuance of debt securities. 

The parent company had cash and cash equivalents of $4.0 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

On January 17, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.155 per common share. The dividend is payable on April 1, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 18, 2024. Based on the current quarterly dividend of $0.155 per common share, cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately $224 million per quarter. Additionally, on January 17, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly Series B, Series E, Series F, Series G, Series H, and Series J Preferred Stock dividend payable on April 15, 2024 to shareholders of record on April 1, 2024. On December 7, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend for the Series I Preferred Stock payable on March 1, 2024 to shareholders of record on February 15, 2024. Total cash demands required for preferred stock dividends are expected to be approximately $36 million per quarter. 

During 2023, the Bank paid preferred and common dividends to the parent company of $45 million and $1.7 billion, respectively. To meet any additional liquidity needs, the parent company may issue debt or equity securities. To support the parent company&#8217;s ability to issue debt or equity securities, we have filed with the SEC an automatic shelf registration statement covering an indeterminate amount or number of securities to be offered or sold from time to time as authorized by the Huntington&#8217;s Board of Directors. 

At December 31, 2023, we believe the Company has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the normal course of business, we enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include commitments to extend credit, interest rate swaps, caps and floors, swaption collars, financial guarantees contained in standby letters-of-credit issued by the Bank, and commitments by the Bank to sell mortgage loans. 

COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT 

Commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates, are variable-rate, and contain clauses that permit Huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customer&#8217;s credit quality. These arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer, the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions, credit quality, probability of funding, and other relevant factors. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements. The interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly short-term, variable-rate nature. See Note 22 - &#8220; Commitments and Contingent Liabilities &#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 

STANDBY LETTERS-OF-CREDIT 

Standby letters-of-credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. Most of these arrangements mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Standby letters-of-credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the parent company and the Bank are required to hold. Through our credit process, we monitor the credit risks of outstanding standby letters-of-credit. When it is probable that a standby letter-of-credit will be drawn and not repaid in full, a loss is recognized in the provision for credit losses. See Note 22 - &#8220; Commitments and Contingent Liabilities &#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 

76 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

COMMITMENTS TO SELL LOANS 

Activity related to our mortgage origination activity supports the hedging of the mortgage pricing commitments to customers and the secondary sale to third parties. In addition, we have commitments to sell residential real estate loans. These contracts mature in less than one year. See Note 22 - &#8220; Commitments and Contingent Liabilities &#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 

Contractual obligations, including off-balance sheet arrangements, are properly considered in our liquidity risk management process.

Operational Risk 

Operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error, third-party performance failures, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, including the use of financial or other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results; violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards; and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, failed business contingency plans, and security risks. We continuously strive to test and strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with significant contracts, agreements, laws, rules, and regulations, to reduce our exposure to fraud, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. 

We actively monitor cyberattacks such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data. We evaluate internal systems, processes, and controls to mitigate loss from cyber-attacks and, to date, have not experienced any material losses. Cybersecurity threats have increased, primarily through phishing campaigns. We are actively monitoring our email gateways for malicious phishing email campaigns. We have also increased our cybersecurity and fraud monitoring activities through the implementation of specific monitoring of remote connections by geography and volume of connections to detect anomalous remote logins, since a significant portion of our workforce has the option to work remotely. 

Our objective for managing cybersecurity risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems. We work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack, and by diligently managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on its own goals. To this end we employ a set of defense in-depth strategies, which include efforts to make us less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats, while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response. Potential concerns related to cybersecurity may be escalated to our board-level Technology Committee, as appropriate. As a complement to the overall cybersecurity risk management, we use a number of internal training methods, both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates. Internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks. We also use third-party services to test the effectiveness of our cybersecurity risk management framework, and any such third parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality. 

2023 Form 10-K 77 

To govern operational risks, we have an Operational Risk Committee, a Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Committee, a Funds Movement Committee, a Fraud Risk Committee, an Information and Technology Risk Committee, and a Third Party Risk Management Committee. The responsibilities of these committees, among other duties, include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns, risks, or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues. In addition, we have a Model Risk Oversight Committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise. These committees report any significant findings and remediation recommendations to the Risk Management Committee. Potential concerns may be escalated to our ROC and our Audit Committee, as appropriate. 

The goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk-monitoring; minimize operational, fraud, and legal losses; minimize the impact of inadequately designed models and enhance our overall performance. 

Compliance Risk 

Financial institutions are subject to many laws, rules, and regulations at both the federal and state levels. These broad-based laws, rules, and regulations include, but are not limited to, expectations relating to anti-money laundering, lending limits, client privacy, fair lending, prohibitions against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, protections for military members as they enter active duty, and community reinvestment. The volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk. As such, we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met, including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Our colleagues receive training for several broad-based laws and regulations including, but not limited to, anti-money laundering and customer privacy. Additionally, colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection, equal credit opportunity, fair lending, and/or other courses related to the extension of credit. We hold ourselves to a high standard for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance. 

Capital 

(This section should be read in conjunction with the &#8220; Regulatory Matters &#8221; section included in Part I, Item 1: Business and Note 23 - &#8220; Other Regulatory Matters &#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

Our primary capital objective is to maintain appropriate levels of capital within our Board-approved risk appetite to support the Bank's operations, absorb unanticipated losses and declines in asset values, and provide protection to uninsured depositors and debt holders in the event of liquidation, while also funding organic growth and providing appropriate returns to our shareholders. Both regulatory capital and shareholders&#8217; equity are managed at the Bank and on a consolidated basis. We have an active program for managing capital and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing the Company&#8217;s overall capital adequacy, including the monitoring and reporting of capital risk metrics to the Board and ROC that we believe are useful for evaluating capital adequacy and making capital decisions. In addition to as-reported regulatory capital and tangible common equity metrics, which are discussed in more detail below, we also actively monitor other measures of capital, such as tangible common equity including the mark-to-market impact on HTM securities and CET1 inclusive of AOCI excluding cash flow hedges. We believe our capital levels are adequate. 

Regulatory Capital 

We are subject to the Basel III capital requirements including the standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets in accordance with subpart D of the final capital rule. The following table presents risk-weighted assets and other financial data necessary to calculate certain financial ratios, including CET1, which we use to measure capital adequacy.

At December 31, 2023, we, at both the consolidated and Bank level, maintained Basel III capital ratios in excess of the well-capitalized standards established by the Federal Reserve. The increase in the consolidated CET1 risk-based capital ratio compared to the prior year, was primarily driven by current period earnings and a decrease in risk-weighted assets, partially offset by dividends. The decrease in risk-weighted assets was largely driven by the synthetic CRT transaction, which reduced risk-weighted assets by approximately $2.4 billion, with the risk-weight moving from 100% to 20% on the selected pool of assets. 

Shareholders&#8217; Equity 

We generate shareholders&#8217; equity primarily through the retention of earnings, net of dividends and share repurchases. Other potential sources of shareholders&#8217; equity include issuances of common and preferred stock. Our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk appetite and risk tolerance objectives, to meet both regulatory and market expectations, and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities. 

Shareholders&#8217; equity totaled $19.4 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 9%, when compared with December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by earnings, net of dividends, the changing rate environment causing a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and net issuance of preferred stock. The net issuance of preferred stock is reflective of the first quarter of 2023 issuance of $317 million of Series J perpetual preferred stock, partially offset by the fourth quarter of 2023 repurchases totaling $90 million of Series E perpetual preferred stock. 

80 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

Share Repurchases 

From time to time the Board of Directors authorizes the Company to repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce when our Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Future stock repurchases may be private or open-market repurchases, including block transactions, accelerated or delayed block transactions, forward transactions, and similar transactions. Various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations. 

On January 18, 2023, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of common shares within the eight quarter period ending December 31, 2024, subject to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s capital regulations. Purchases of common stock under the authorization may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and accelerated share repurchase programs. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased no 

shares of common stock under the current repurchase authorization. As part of the 2023 capital plan and our 

current expectation that organic capital will be used for funding loan and lease growth and proposed changes to 

regulatory capital requirements, we do not expect to utilize the share repurchase program through 2024. However, 

we may at our discretion resume share repurchases at any time while considering factors including, but not limited 

to, capital requirements and market conditions. 

BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION 

Overview 

Huntington&#8217;s business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how we monitor results and assess performance. To align with our strategic priorities, during the second quarter of 2023, we completed an organizational realignment and now report on two business segments: Consumer &#38; Regional Banking and Commercial Banking. The Treasury / Other function includes technology and operations, and other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. The organizational realignment primarily involved consolidating our previously reported Consumer and Business Banking, Vehicle Finance and RBHPCG, into one new business segment called Consumer &#38; Regional Banking. Prior period results have been adjusted to conform to the new segment presentation. 

Business segment results are determined based upon our management practices, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments. The process is designed around our organizational and management structure and, accordingly, the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions. 

Revenue Sharing 

Revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service. Fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers. Results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations. 

Expense Allocation 

The management process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments. Expenses are allocated to business segments using a two-phase approach. The first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs (activity-based costs) to activities related to product origination and servicing. These activity-based costs are then extended, based on volumes, with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products. The second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to the business segments from Treasury / Other. We utilize a full-allocation methodology, where all Treasury / Other expenses, except reported acquisition-related expenses, if any, and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses, are allocated to the business segments. 

2023 Form 10-K 81 

Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP) 

We use an active and centralized FTP methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments. The intent of the FTP methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing modeled duration funding of assets and liabilities. The result is to centralize the financial impact, management, and reporting of interest rate risk in the Treasury / Other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed. The Treasury / Other function charges (credits) an internal cost of funds for assets held in (or pays for funding provided by) each business segment. 

During the fourth quarter of 2023, we revised our FTP methodology for non-maturity deposits, which has been enhanced to consider the internally modeled weighted average life by non-maturity deposit type. In general, the impact of the FTP methodology revision resulted in a higher cost of funds allocation as compared with the previous method. Prior period results have been adjusted to conform to the revised FTP methodology.

Consumer &#38; Regional Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion in 2023, an increase of $288 million, or 28%, compared to the year-ago period. Segment net interest income increased $504 million, or 16%, primarily due to a $2.5 billion, or 4%, increase in average loans and leases and a 46 basis point increase in NIM driven by the higher rate environment. The provision for credit losses decreased $14 million, or 5%, primarily due to modest improvement in the macroeconomic environment that was somewhat offset by consumer loan growth over the course of 2023. Noninterest income decreased $15 million, or 1%, primarily due to decreases in gain on sale of loans resulting from the strategic decision to retain the guaranteed portion of SBA loans at origination, in customer deposit and loan fees largely due to program changes, and in mortgage banking income reflecting secondary marketing spreads and lower salable volume. The decreases in noninterest income were partially offset by a $57 million gain on the sale of our RPS business and increases in wealth and asset management revenue and payments and cash management revenue. Noninterest expense increased $140 million, or 5%, primarily due to higher overhead allocations, gains from branch sales recognized in 2022, an increase in personnel expense, and the impact of the FDIC DIF special assessment. 

Consumer &#38; Regional Banking reported net income of $1.0 billion in 2022, a decrease of $310 million, compared to the prior year period. Segment net interest income increased $110 million, or 4%, primarily due to an increase in average assets reflecting organic growth and the impact of the TCF acquisition, partially offset by a 32 basis point decrease in NIM driven by higher cost of funds and a decrease in accelerated PPP loan fees recognized upon forgiveness payments from the SBA. The provision for credit losses increased $258 million, primarily due to reserve releases in 2021 as the economic environment was improving, contrasted with reserve builds in 2022 that recognized the increased near-term recessionary risks. Noninterest income decreased $17 million, or 1%, primarily due to lower mortgage banking income reflecting lower salable volume and secondary marketing spreads, partially offset by the impact of the TCF acquisition and an increase in gain on sale of loans, primarily due to sales of SBA loans during the first through third quarters of 2022. Noninterest expense increased $226 million, or 8%, primarily due to the impact of the TCF acquisition largely driven by higher personnel expense reflecting an increase in the number of full-time equivalent employees and allocated overhead.

2023 Form 10-K 83 

Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.2 billion in 2023, an increase of $92 million, or 8%, compared to the year-ago period. Segment net interest income increased $355 million, or 20%, primarily due to a 44 basis point increase in NIM, driven by the higher rate environment resulting in an increase in spreads and an increase in average loans and leases, partially offset by an increase in average deposits. The provision for credit losses increased $127 million due to a combination of commercial loan and lease growth and an increase in the coverage ratio in the commercial real estate portfolio, reflecting ongoing risks in the commercial real estate environment. Noninterest income decreased $21 million, or 3%, primarily due to a decrease in customer deposit and loan fees driven by a reduction in loan commitment fees and a decrease in capital markets and advisory fees, largely due to lower interest rate derivatives fees, partially offset by higher advisory fees from the Capstone acquisition. Partially offsetting these decreases in noninterest income were increases in payments and cash management revenue and wealth and asset management revenue. Noninterest expense increased $78 million, or 7%, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs reflecting the impact of the Capstone acquisition and an increase in average full-time equivalent employees, higher allocated overhead, and the impact of the FDIC DIF special assessment, partially offset by lower lease financing equipment depreciation. 

Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.1 billion in 2022, an increase of $148 million, or 16%, compared to the prior year period. Segment net interest income increased $324 million, or 22%, primarily due to an increase in average loans and leases, reflecting the impact of the TCF acquisition and continued organic loan and lease growth, partially offset by a 34 basis point decrease in NIM, driven by higher cost of funds. The provision for credit losses increased $6 million due to a combination of loan and lease growth in 2022 and a reduction in ACL coverage ratios over the course of 2021, as there was more clarity around the economic impacts of COVID-19. Noninterest income increased $148 million, or 29%, reflecting the impact of the TCF acquisition in addition to an increase in capital markets and advisory fees, primarily due to higher advisory fees supported by the impact of the Capstone Partners acquisition, loan syndication fees, foreign exchange fees, and interest rate derivatives fees. Noninterest expense increased $269 million, or 34%, primarily reflecting the impact of the TCF and Capstone Partners acquisitions, which led to higher personnel costs and allocated overhead. 

Treasury / Other 

The Treasury / Other function includes revenue and expense related to assets, liabilities, derivatives (including mark-to-market of interest rate caps, as applicable), and equity not directly assigned or allocated to one of the business segments. Assets include investment securities and bank owned life insurance. 

Net interest income includes the impact of administering our investment securities portfolios, the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity, as well as the financial impact associated with our FTP methodology, as described above. Noninterest income includes miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business segments, such as bank owned life insurance income and securities and trading asset gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes certain corporate administrative, acquisition-related, if any, and other miscellaneous expenses not allocated to other business segments. The provision for income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory 21% tax rate, although our overall effective tax rate is lower. 

Treasury / Other reported a net loss of $543 million in 2023, a decrease in net income of $667 million, compared to the year-ago period, driven by a decrease in net interest income and an increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by an increase in provision benefit for income tax. Net interest income decreased $693 million primarily due to a higher cost of funds. Noninterest expense increased $155 million primarily due to increases in personnel costs and professional services. The increase in provision benefit for income taxes of $204 million is primarily due to lower pre-tax income in addition an increase in discrete tax benefits. 

Treasury / Other reported net income of $124 million in 2022, an increase of $1.1 billion, compared to the year-ago period, driven by a $737 million increase in net interest income and a $669 million decrease in noninterest expense, partially offset by a $261 million reduction in provision benefit for income taxes.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This document contains GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding our results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found herein. 

Fully-Taxable Equivalent Basis 

Interest income, yields, and ratios on an FTE basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes net interest income on an FTE basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes. The FTE basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 21%. We encourage readers to consider the Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-K in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

2023 Form 10-K 85 

Non-Regulatory Capital Ratios 

In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including: 

&#8226; Tangible common equity to tangible assets, 

&#8226; Tangible equity to tangible assets, and 

&#8226; Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets using Basel III definitions. 

These non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare our capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not defined in GAAP or federal banking regulations. As a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company are considered non-GAAP financial measures. 

Because there are no standardized definitions for these non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company&#8217;s calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, we encourage readers to consider the Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-K in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

Risk Factors 

More information on risk is discussed in the Risk Factors section included in Item 1A: &#8220; Risk Factors &#8221; of this report. Additional information regarding risk factors can also be found in the Risk Management and Capital discussion of this report, as well as the &#8220; Regulatory Matters &#8221; section included in Item 1: Business of this report. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates 

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 1 - &#8220; Significant Accounting Policies &#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated by reference into this MD&#38;A, describes the significant accounting policies we used in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

An accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time, and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. Our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

Our ACL at December 31, 2023 represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded lending commitments. Management estimates the ACL by projecting probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default conditional on economic parameters, for the remaining contractual term. Internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances, the portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. 

One of the most significant judgments influencing the ACL estimate is the macroeconomic forecasts. Key external economic parameters that directly impact our loss modeling framework include forecasted unemployment rates and GDP. Changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses, which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next. 

Given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within our modeling framework, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance. As a result, management uses a probability-weighted approach that incorporates a baseline, an adverse, and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate. 

86 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

However, to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, management calculated a quantitative allowance using a 100% weighting applied to an adverse scenario. This scenario contemplates an increased risk of an extended government shutdown, persisting inflation concerns at the Federal Reserve causing the federal funds rate to remain elevated through the first quarter of 2024, ongoing banking industry uncertainty, and the tightening of lending standards. Increased geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan impact the supply chain for semiconductors and the threat of a wider conflict causes consumer confidence to fall. Additionally, the Russian invasion of Ukraine lasts longer than in the baseline scenario and concerns increase around the Hamas-Israel conflict leading to a broader war in the Middle East. The combination of the risk of federal shutdown, political tensions, tightening lending standards and the federal funds rate remaining elevated cause the stock market to fall. The economy falls into a recession in the first quarter of 2024. In response to the recession, the Federal Reserve starts lowering the federal funds rate in the second quarter of 2024, with significant rate reductions by the end of 2024. Under this scenario, as an example, the unemployment rate increases from baseline levels and remains elevated for a prolonged period, the rate is estimated at 7.6% and 6.9% at the end of 2024 and 2025, respectively. This forecast reflects unemployment rates that are approximately 3.6% and 2.9% higher than baseline scenario projections of 4.0% and 4.0%, respectively, for the same time periods. 

To demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters used in the calculation of our ACL at December 31, 2023, management calculated the difference between our quantitative ACL and this 100% adverse scenario. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our ACL of approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2023. This hypothetical increase is reflective of the sensitivity of the rate of change in the unemployment variable on our models. 

The resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in allowance levels for a number of reasons including the following: 

&#8226; Management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process; 

&#8226; The highly uncertain economic environment; 

&#8226; The difficulty in predicting the inter-relationships between the economic parameters used in the various economic scenarios; and 

&#8226; The sensitivity estimate does not account for any general reserve components and associated risk profile adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework. 

We regularly review our ACL for appropriateness by performing on-going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio. In doing so, we consider factors such as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. We also evaluate the impact of changes in key economic parameters and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our ACL at each reporting date. There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast. Additionally, events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or our markets such as geopolitical instability, or risks of inflation including a near-term recession, could severely impact our current expectations. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the geopolitical instability and risks of inflation will continue to negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, liquidity, and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time. For more information, see Note 5 - &#8221; Loans / Leases &#8221; and Note 6 - &#8220; Allowance for Credit Losses &#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

2023 Form 10-K 87 

Goodwill 

The acquisition method of accounting requires that assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets and liabilities often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, all of which are inherently subjective. This typically results in goodwill, the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value, which is subject to impairment testing at least annually. 

Management reviews the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. 

Based on our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of October 1, 2023, it was determined that the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of its respective carrying value as of October 1, 2023; therefore, goodwill is considered not impaired. Huntington additionally performs sensitivity analyses around discount rate assumptions utilized in order to assess the reasonableness of the rates, and the resulting estimated fair values. As of October 1, 2023, a 100 basis point increase in discount rates would reduce estimated entity level fair value by approximately $2 billion and would not result in any impairment, as each reporting unit&#8217;s fair value would still exceed its carrying value. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Developments 

Note 2 - &#8220; Accounting Standards Update &#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2023 and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted. To the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity, the impacts are discussed in the applicable section of this MD&#38;A and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
