 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Executive Summary 

The following financial review provides a discussion of Synovus' financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations as well as a summary of Synovus' critical accounting policies. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Report. 

Economic Environment and Recent Events 

The U.S. economy contracted in the first half of 2020, ending the longest expansionary period in U.S. history, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During March 2020, in an effort to lessen the impact of COVID-19 on consumers and businesses, the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate 1.5 percentage points to 0.00 to 0.25 percent and the U.S. government enacted the CARES Act, the largest economic stimulus package in the nation&#8217;s history. The U.S. economy began to recover somewhat during the third quarter of 2020. On December 27, 2020, the U.S government amended the CARES Act through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, to add additional stimulus relief to mitigate the continued impacts of the pandemic. While certain financial and economic metrics suggest improving economic conditions, uncertainty remains regarding the trajectory of the economic recovery, the impact of government stimulus, the success of the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as the effects of the change in presidential and congressional administrations. 

Synovus responded to the pandemic, beginning in March 2020, supporting our customers, team members, and communities with such measures as remote work capabilities and branch service enhancements; COVID-19 related bonus payments and benefits for team members directly impacted by the virus; payment deferments on approximately $6 billion of our loan portfolio during the second quarter; and accelerated investments in several technology initiatives that provided more convenience and a better digital experience as customers adapted to this highly virtual environment. Synovus is participating in the PPP and funded close to 19,000 loans totaling nearly $2.9 billion during the second quarter. Synovus is also participating in the newest round of PPP, with over 8,000 loan applications submitted, totaling $1 billion in new requests as of February 24, 2021. Additionally, although the vast majority of our customers were no longer in a deferment program at the end of the year, we continued to work with our borrowers who have been impacted b y the pandemic, largely concentrated in hospitality related segments including hotels and full-service restaurants. In our communities, we responded with financial contributions to more than a dozen organizations for pandemic relief efforts, matching contributions for COVID-19 donations to the American Red Cross, and meal donations for first responders and health care workers. 

We announced Synovus Forward in January 2020, a plan to add $100 million pre-tax benefit by the end of 2021 through a combination of revenue and expense initiatives. Our expense initiatives included reductions in third-party spend of $25 million; branch rationalization with 13 branches consolidated during 2020, with $5 million in savings; and organizational staffing efficiencies, with a voluntary early retirement program and back-office staffing optimization, with $13 million in benefit in 2021. Our revenue initiatives included market-based repricing of our treasury and payment solutions offerings, with an anticipated benefit of $9 million in the first half of 2021; aggressive repricing of deposits; a commercial analytics program; and significant improvements in our digital capabilities. In January 2021, we announced an expected additional $75 million benefit to be achieved by year-end 2022, with benefits from both revenue and expense initiatives, with a heavier weight toward revenues. 

In December, an executive transition plan was announced, and Kevin Blair was named to Synovus' Board of Directors, effective immediately. In April 2021, Chairman and CEO Kessel Stelling will transition into the role of Executive Chairman and Mr. Blair will succeed Mr. Stelling as CEO. 

Overview of 2020 Financial Results 

Net income available to common shareholders for 2020 was $340.5 million, a decrease of 37% compared to $540.9 million for 2019. Net income per diluted common share was $2.30 in 2020 and $3.47 in 2019. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders (1) for 2020 was $356.7 million, or $2.41 per diluted common share, a decrease of 41% and 38%, respectively, compared to $608.5 million, or $3.90 per diluted common share, for 2019. The year-over-year decline in adjusted net income per common share was impacted by deterioration in the economic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and driven by a significant increase in provision for credit losses following the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, significant decline in the federal funds rate, and PAA including loan discount accretion and deposit premium amortization that positively impacted 2019. 

Net interest income for 2020 was $1.51 billion, down $83.1 million, or 5%, from $1.60 billion in 2019 due to declines of $87.3 million in PAA (primarily comprised of declines of $43.8 million of deposit premium amortization and $40.5 million of loan accretion) associated with the FCB acquisition and declines in market interest rates, which were somewhat offset by higher 

average earning assets including the impact of PPP with recognition of $46.0 million in processing fees. The net interest margin was 3.18% for 2020, a decrease of 52 basis points from 3.70% in 2019, due primarily to the decline in market interest rates in ad dition to 21 basis points from declines in PAA. Excluding the impact from PPP, we expect modest downward pressure in the net interest margin in the first quarter of 2021, as further reductions in cost of funds are more than offset by continued fixed-rate asset repricing. 

Non-interest revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $506.5 million, up $150.6 million, or 42%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted non-interest revenue (1) , which excludes net investment securities gains (losses) and gain on sale and net changes in fair value of private equity investments, was $422.8 million, up $70.9 million, or 20%, compared to 2019, due primarily to strong growth in mortgage banking income with record production driven by the interest rate environment. We expect more normalized secondary mortgage banking revenue in 2021. 

Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.18 billion, an increase of $80.6 million, or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. During 2020, Synovus recognized a $44.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge representing the goodwill allocated to the Consumer Mortgage reporting unit. Adjusted non-interest expense (1) , which excludes goodwill impairment, restructuring charges, loss on early extinguishment of debt, earnout liability adjustments, merger-related expense and certain other items, for 2020 increased $68.9 million, or 7%, compared to 2019. The increase in adjusted expense was largely driven by mortgage production commissions, expense associated with Synovus' internal revenue growth and efficiency initiatives, PPP and COVID-19 related expenses, and investments in talent and technology. The efficiency ratio-FTE for 2020 was 58.32% compared to 56.22% in 2019, and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 55.74% compared to 51.82% in 2019. 

At December 31, 2020, total loans, net of deferred fees and costs of $38.25 billion, increased $1.09 billion, or 3%, from December 31, 2019 due to net C&#38;I growth of $2.60 billion, primarily in PPP loans, and net CRE growth of $76.7 million, partially offset by a $1.54 billion net decline in consumer loans. The decline in consumer loans is primarily the result of the strategic disposition of $1.42 billion in third-party single-service consumer and non-relationship consumer mortgage loans. 

The ACL at December 31, 2020 totaled $653.5 million, an increase of $370.7 million compared to December 31, 2019, reflecting the building of the ACL required under CECL primarily as a result of uncertainty and deterioration in the economic environment due to COVID-19. The ACL to loans coverage ratio was 1.71%, or 1.81%, excluding PPP loans at December 31, 2020. Current credit metrics remained relatively stable with NPA and NPL ratios of 0.50% and 0.39%, respectively, and total past dues of 0.12%. Net charge-offs for 2020 were 24 basis points compared to 16 basis points for 2019. We expect the net charge-off ratio in the first quarter of 2021 to be near the range we experienced in the last half of 2020. 

Total period-end deposits were $46.69 billion at December 31, 2020, up significantly by $8.29 billion, or 22%, compared to year-end 2019, due largely to client preferences for maintaining liquidity during 2020 as well as government stimulus programs which further supported deposit growth, partially offset by strategic declines in time deposits. We expect the elevated cash position to decline in coming quarters due to seasonal deposit outflows and as we manage our balance sheet and overall liquidity position, which will include further growth in our securities portfolio and continued declines in brokered deposits. 

Our CET1 ratio of 9.66% at December 31, 2020 was above our stated operating range of 9-9.5%, which we believe is prudent while greater levels of uncertainty exist. Our 2021 outlook maintains the current common shareholder dividend of $0.33 per quarter and includes authorization for share repurchases of up to $200 million. We will be opportunistic with repurchase activity throughout the year as we prioritize organic growth first and balance capital deployment with factors such as uncertainty in the economic outlook.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of Synovus are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as &#8220;critical accounting policies,&#8221; consisting of those related to the accounting for the allowance for credit losses, goodwill, and income taxes. In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, Synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management's practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors' Audit Committee on a periodic basis, including the development, selection, implementation, and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on Synovus&#8217; consolidated financial statements. Synovus&#8217; financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are applied in the application of these policies. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

In accordance with CECL, the ACL, which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments, represents management's best estimate of expected losses over the life of loans adjusted for prepayments, and over the life of loan commitments expected to fund. Synovus' loans and unfunded loan commitments are grouped based upon the nature of the loan type and the forecasted PD, adjusted for relevant forecasted macroeconomic factors comprising multiple weighted scenarios representing different plausible outcomes, and LGD, to determine the allowance for the majority of our portfolio. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments and curtailments when appropriate. To the extent the lives of the loans in the portfolio extend beyond the period for which a reasonable and supportable forecast can be made (which is two years for Synovus), the Company reverts, on a straight-line basis back to the historical rates over a one year period. Life-of-loan loss percentages may also be adjusted, as necessary, for certain quantitative and qualitative factors that in management's judgment are necessary to reflect losses expected in the portfolio. These adjustments address inherent limitations in the quantitative model including uncertainty and limitations, among others. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are individually evaluated on a loan by loan basis with specific reserves, if any, recorded as appropriate. 

The economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly, and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower. The ACL is a significant accounting estimate as significant judgments and estimates are necessary in determining the reserve. Significant judgments include, among others, economic forecasts, the determination and measurement of individually evalua ted loans, the timing of loan charge-offs, the probability of loan defaults , the net loss exposure in the event of loan defaults, qualitative loss factors, as well as other qualitative considerations. In determining the ACL, management makes numerous assumptions, estimates, and assessments, which are inherently subjective. The use of different estimates or assumptions could have a significant impact on the provision for credit losses, ACL, non-performing loans, loan charge-offs, financial condition, and results of operations. A detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the ACL as well as information regarding recently issued accounting standards related to the allowance are included in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses" of this Report. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. Synovus performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each year and as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. During 2020, due to triggering events brought on by COVID-19, Synovus performed quantitative assessments as of March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, September 30, 2020, and November 30, 2020. The quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment included determining the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, utilizing a combination of discounted cash flow and market-based approaches, and comparing that fair value to each reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 

Based on the assessment performed at September 30, 2020, Synovus recognized a $ 44.9 million goodwill impairment charge representing all goodwill allocated to the Consumer Mortgage reporting unit. During the fourth quarter of 2020, Synovus performed an additional quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment for each reporting unit with a remaining goodwill balance, Community Banking, Wholesale Banking and Wealth Management, using the test date of November 30, 2020. Based on the results of the quantitative assessment, the fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value. Additional qualitative analysis through year-end demonstrated that goodwill is not impaired as of December 31, 2020. 

Goodwill assessments are highly sensitive to economic projections and the related assumptions and estimates used by management. Refer to "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant 

Accounting Policies" and "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" in this Report for additional information. 

Income taxes 

The calculation of Synovus&#8217; income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination. As part of Synovus&#8217; overall business strategy, management must consider tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances under consideration. As such, the Company is often required to exercise significant judgment regarding the interpretation of these tax laws and regulations, in which Synovus' anticipated and actual liability could significantly vary based upon the taxing authority&#8217;s interpretation. Specifically, significant estimates in accounting for income taxes relate to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, estimates of the realizability of income tax credits, utilization of NOLs, the determination of taxable income, and the determination of uncertain tax positions and temporary differences between book and tax bases. Adjustments to these items may occur due to modifications in tax rates, newly enacted laws, issuance of tax regulations, resolution of items with taxing authorities, alterations to interpretative statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance that affects the Company&#8217;s tax positions, methods or election s changes, or other facts and circumstances. Management closely monitors tax developments and the potential timing of these changes in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the Company&#8217;s overall tax position and the estimates and judgments used in determining the income tax provision and records adjustments as necessary. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 18 - Income Taxes" in this Report for additional details. 

DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Investment Securities Available for Sale 

The investment securities portfolio consists primarily of high-quality liquid debt securities classified as available for sale. The on-going investment philosophy for the securities portfolio focuses on maintaining a readily accessible source of liquidity while also supporting the income and interest rate risk management objectives of the Company. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 - Investment Securities Available for Sale" in this Report for additional information. 

During 2020, Synovus strategically repositioned the investment securities portfolio, which resulted in net gains of $78.9 million. The average balance of investment securities available for sale increased to $7.01 billion in 2020 from $6.76 billion in 2019, representing 14.6% and 15.6%, respectively, of average interest earning assets. The portfolio earned a taxable-equivalent rate of 2.55% and 3.09% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the estimated fair value of investment securities available for sale as a percentage of their amortized cost was 102.1% and 102.0%, respectively, with net unrealized gains of $160.6 million and $130.9 million, respectively. The investment securities portfolio had a weighted average duration of 2.5 years at December 31, 2020, compared to 3.5 years at December 31, 2019, with the reduction in portfolio duration primarily attributable to higher prepay expectations as a result of lower long-term interest rates. 

The calculation of weighted average yields for investment securities available for sale displayed below is based on the amortized cost and effective yields of each security. Maturity information is presented based upon contractual maturity. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

* Loan balance in each category is before net deferred fees and costs and is expressed as a percentage of total loans, net of deferred fees and costs. 

At December 31, 2020, total loans, net of deferred fees and costs, of $38.25 billion, increased $1.09 billion, or 3%, from December 31, 2019 due to net C&#38;I growth of $2.60 billion, primarily in PPP loans, and net CRE growth of $76.7 million, partially offset by a $1.54 billion net decline in consumer loans. The decline in consumer loans is primarily the result of the strategic disposition of $1.42 billion in third-party single-service consumer loans and non-relationship consumer mortgage loans. C&#38;I loans remain the largest component of our loan portfolio, representing 50.7% of total loans, while CRE and consumer loans represent 27.5% and 21.8%, respectively. The outstanding balance of PPP loans at December 31, 2020 was $2.19 billion, net of unearned fees of $48.9 million. Our portfolio composition is established through a comprehensive concentration management policy which sets limits for C&#38;I, CRE, and consumer loan levels as well as sub-categories therein. 

U.S. Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) 

Synovus is participating in the PPP, which is a loan program that originated from the CARES Act and was subsequently expanded by the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (&#8220;PPPHCEA Act&#8221;) which was passed by Congress on April 23, 2020 and signed into law on April 24, 2020. PPP loans are forgivable, in whole or in part, if the proceeds are used for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP. These loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of two years, if not forgiven, in whole or in part. The loans are guaranteed by the SBA. The SBA pays the originating bank a processing fee ranging from 1% to 5%, based on the size of the loan. Synovus began accepting applications from qualified customers on April 3, 2020 and provided nearly $2.9 billion in funding to close to 19,000 customers through the PPP during the second quarter of 2020. The average PPP loan was approximately $150 thousand, and the customers that received those loans employ over 335 thousand individuals. In November 2020, Synovus began receiving PPP loan forgiveness that totaled approximately $540 million, or approximately $516 million, net of unearned fees, for the fourth quarter of 2020. Deferred fees and costs, net at December 31, 2020 included $48.9 million of net fees associated with PPP loans. 

On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (the Economic Aid Act) was signed into law, and section 311 of the Economic Aid Act authorizes the SBA to guarantee PPP second draw loans. The PPP for first draw loans reopened during the week of January 11, 2021, and the SBA also started allowing certain eligible borrowers that previously received a PPP loan to apply for a second draw PPP with the same general loan terms as their first draw PPP loan with an extended maturity date of five years. A borrower is generally eligible for a second draw PPP Loan of up to $2 million if the borrower previously received a first draw PPP Loan and will or has used the full amount only for authorized uses, has no more than 300 employees, and can demonstrate at least a 25% reduction in gross receipts between any comparable 

quarter in 2019 and 2020. Synovus began participating in the second draw of the PPP on January 19, 2021 with over 8,000 loan applications submitted, totaling $1 billion in new requests, as of February 24, 2021. 

Commercial Loans 

Total commercial loans (which are comprised of C&#38;I and CRE loans) at December 31, 2020 were $29.94 billion, or 78.2%, of the total loan portfolio, compared to $27.26 billion, or 73.4% at December 31, 2019. 

At December 31, 2020 Synovus had six commercial loan relationships with total commitments of $100 million or more (including amounts funded), with no single relationship exceeding $150 million in commitments. 

Commercial and Industrial Loans 

The C&#38;I loan portfolio represents the largest category of Synovus' loan portfolio and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a diverse set of industries. The following table shows the composition of the C&#38;I loan portfolio aggregated by NAICS code. In accordance with Synovus' lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process which incorporates uniform underwriting standards and oversight in proportion to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. As of December 31, 2020, 83.2% (93.8% excluding PPP loans) of Synovus' C&#38;I loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventory, and other types of collateral compared to 92.6% as of December 31, 2019. C&#38;I loans grew $2.60 billion, or 16%, from December 31, 2019, driven primarily by $2.19 billion in PPP loans net of unearned fees at December 31, 2020 .

* &#160; Loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total C&#38;I loans. 

At December 31, 2020, $12.57 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 32.9% of the total loan portfolio (including PPP loans of $2.19 billion net of unearned fees), represented loans for the purpose of financing commercial, financial, and agricultural business activities. The primary source of repayment on these loans is revenue generated from products or services offered by the business or organization. The secondary source of repayment is the collateral, which consists primarily of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, time deposits, cash surrender value of life insurance, and other business assets. 

At December 31, 2020, $6.80 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 17.8% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing owner-occupied properties. The financing of owner-occupied facilities is considered a C&#38;I loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral. This treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The secondary source of repayment on these loans is the underlying real estate. These loans are predominately secured by owner-occupied and other real estate, and to a lesser extent, other types of collateral. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

CRE loans primarily consist of income-producing investment properties loans. Additionally, CRE loans include 1-4 family properties loans as well as land and development loans. Total CRE loans of $10.57 billion increased $76.7 million from December 31, 2019, driven primarily by growth in income-producing investment properties loans mostly offset by declines in both 1-4 family properties and land and development loans. 

Investment Properties Loans 

Investment properties loans consist of construction and mortgage loans for income-producing properties and are primarily made to finance multi-family properties, hotels, office buildings, shopping centers, warehouses and other commercial development properties. Total investment properties loans as of December 31, 2020 were $9.35 billion, or 88.4% of the total CRE loan portfolio, and 24.3% of the total loan portfolio, growing $342.2 million, or 4%, compared to $9.00 billion, or 85.8% of the total CRE loan portfolio, and 24.2% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. Most sub-categories experienced growth other than shopping centers, which were down $178.3 million, or 10%, from December 31, 2019. 

The following table shows the principal categories of the investment properties loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

* Loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total investment properties loans. 

1-4 Family Properties Loans 

1-4 family properties loans include construction loans to home builders and commercial mortgage loans related to 1-4 family rental properties and are almost always secured by the underlying property being financed by such loans. These properties are primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. At December 31, 2020, 1-4 family properties loans totaled $629.2 million, or 6.0% of the CRE loan portfolio, and decreased by $150.8 million, or 19%, from December 31, 2019. 

Land and Development Loans 

Land and development loans include commercial and residential development as well as land acquisition loans and are secured by land held for future development, typically in excess of one year. Properties securing these loans are substantially within markets served by Synovus, and loan terms generally include personal guarantees from the principals. Loans in this portfolio are underwritten based on the LTV of the collateral and the capacity of the guarantor(s). Land and development loans of $594.7 million at December 31, 2020 decreased $114.7 million, or 16%, from $709.4 million at December 31, 2019. 

Consumer Loans 

The consumer loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through Synovus' banking network including first and second residential mortgages, HELOCs, and credit card loans, as well as home improvement, student and personal loans from third-party lending partnerships. The majority of Synovus' consumer loans are consumer mortgages and HELOCs secured by first and second liens on residential real estate primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, weighted average FICO scores within the residential real estate portfolio based on committed balances were 791 and 787 for HELOCs and 776 and 778 for Consumer Mortgages, respectively. 

Consumer loans at December 31, 2020 of $8.39 billion decreased $1.54 billion, or 15%, compared to $9.92 billion at December 31, 2019 primarily due to the strategic disposition of certain third-party single-service consumer loans and non-relationship consumer mortgage loans. 

Consumer mortgages declined $38.7 million from December 31, 2019 due to the strategic sale of $180.2 million in non-relationship consumer mortgage loans, somewhat offset by record production primarily resulting from the low rate environment. HELOCs decreased $189.3 million, or 11%, from December 31, 2019 driven by paydowns and payoffs in the current low rate environment. Other consumer loans decreased $1.32 billion, or 55%, from December 31, 2019, primarily due to the strategic disposition of certain third-party single-service consumer loans totaling $1.24 billion. As of December 31, 2020, third-party lending partnerships had combined balances of $628.2 million, or 1.6%, of the total loan portfolio, compared to $1.98 billion, or 5.3%, of the total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2019, due to strategic dispositions and restructuring of certain lending partnership arrangements with a shift of new originations to held for sale. 

The following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016.

Total period-end deposits were $46.69 billion at December 31, 2020, up significantly by $8.29 billion, or 22%, compared to year-end 2019, due largely to client preferences for maintaining liquidity during 2020 as well as government stimulus programs which further supported deposit growth, partially offset by strategic declines in time deposits. Core tra nsaction deposits increased $8.59 billion, or 36%, compared to December 31, 2019, with significant growth in all categories. On an average basis, total deposits of $43.04 billion were up $5.21 billion, or 14%, compared to the prior year.

Net Interest Income 

The following table summarizes the components of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, including the tax-equivalent adjustment that is required in making yields on tax-exempt loans and investment securities comparable to taxable loans and investment securities. The taxable-equivalent adjustment is based on a 21% federal income tax rate for the three years shown.

Net interest income (interest income less interest expense) is the largest component of total revenues, representing earnings from the primary business of gathering funds from customer deposits and other sources, and investing those funds primarily in loans and fixed-income securities. Synovus&#8217; long-term objective is to manage those assets and liabilities to maximize net interest income while balancing interest rate, credit, liquidity, and capital risks. 

Net interest income for 2020 was $1.51 billion, down $83.1 million, or 5%, from $1.60 billion in 2019, and on a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income decreased $82.7 million, or 5%, from 2019. The decline in net interest income from 2019 was due to declines of $87.3 million in PAA (primarily comprised of declines of $43.8 million of deposit premium amortization and $40.5 million of loan accretion) associated with the FCB acquisition and declines in market interest rates, which were somewhat offset by higher average earning assets including the impact of PPP with recognition of $46.0 million in processing fees. During 2020, average earning assets increased $4.55 billion, or 11%, driven primarily by an increase in net loans which included average PPP loans of $1.87 billion, an increase in interest-bearing funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank, an increase in loans held for sale, and an increase in investment securities available for sale. 

Net Interest Margin 

Net interest margin is a measure of the spread between interest earning assets relative to the cost of funding and can be used to assess the efficiency of earnings from balance sheet activities. The net interest margin is affected by changes in interest earning asset yields, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, the percentage of interest earning assets funded by non-interest-bearing funding sources, and the mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

The net interest margin was 3.18% for 2020, a decrease of 52 basis points from 3.70% in 2019, due primarily to the decline in market interest rates in addition to 21 basis points from declines in PAA. The yield on earning assets decreased 96 basis points to 3.78% from 4.74% in 2019, while the effective cost of funds decreased 44 basis points from 1.04% in 2019 to 0.60%. 

The primary components of the yield on interest earning assets are loan yields, yields on investment securities, and the yield on balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank. Loan yields declined 94 basis points and yields on investment securities declined 54 basis points, primarily driven by declines in market interest rates and a decline of 13 basis points in loan yields from declines in PAA. Additionally, yields were somewhat diluted by the PPP loan portfolio which had a yield of 3.48%, inclusive of $46.0 million in processing fees recognized during the year. Earning asset yields were also negatively impacted by the increase in cash balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank as compared to the prior year. 

The decline in the effective cost of funds during 2020 was primarily driven by declines in market interest rates and liability remixing. This was offset in part by 8 basis points of less favorable PAA in 2020 as compared to the prior year.

Non-interest Revenue 

Non-interest revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $506.5 million, up $150.6 million, or 42%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted non-interest revenue, which excludes net investment securities gains (losses) and gain on sale and net changes in fair value of private equity investments, was $422.8 million, up $70.9 million, or 20%, compared to 2019, due primarily to strong growth in mortgage banking income with record production driven by the rate environment . See "Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures" of this Report for applicable reconciliation to GAAP measure. 

The following table shows the principal components of non-interest income.

$ 506,513 &#160; $ 355,900 $ 280,093 ##TABLE_END

Service charges on deposit accounts were $73.1 million in 2020, a decrease of $15.1 million, or 17%, compared to 2019, due primarily to the impact of COVID-19, including fewer transactions and the impact of higher average balances. Service charges on deposit accounts consist of NSF fees, account analysis fees, and all other service charges. NSF fees of $26.2 million were down $12.5 million, or 32%. Account analysis fees of $28.8 million were flat compared to 2019. All other service charges on deposit accounts, which consist primarily of monthly fees on retail demand deposits, savings accounts, and small business accounts, were $18.1 million for 2020, down $2.6 million, or 13%, compared to 2019. 

Fiduciary and asset management fees are derived from providing estate administration, personal trust, corporate trust, corporate bond, investment management, financial planning, and family office services. Fiduciary and asset management fees were $63.3 million, an increase of $4.9 million, or 8%, from 2019. The increase was driven by growth in total assets under management. The total value of assets under management (including brokerage assets under management) at December 31, 2020 was approximately $20.2 billion, up 19%, compared to approximately $17.0 billion at December 31, 2019. Assets under management consist of all assets where Synovus has investment authority. Assets under advisement were approximately $5.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2019, up 79% from 2019. Assets under advisement consist of non-managed assets as well as non-custody assets where Synovus earns a consulting fee. Many of the fiduciary and asset management fee charges are based on asset values, and changes in these values throughout the year directly impact fees earned. 

Card fees decreased $3.0 million, or 6%, over 2019. Card fees consist primarily of credit card interchange fees, debit card interchange fees, and merchant discounts. Card fees are reported net of certain associated expense items including customer loyalty program expenses and network expenses. The decrease in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to lower transaction volume as a result of the impact from COVID-19. 

Brokerage revenue was $44.8 million, a $3.2 million, or 8%, increase over 2019. Brokerage revenue consists primarily of brokerage commissions as well as advisory fees earned from the management of customer assets. The increase in 2020 over 2019 was largely driven by growth in brokerage assets under management, increasing contributions from new hires, and higher transaction revenue from elevated market volatility. 

Mortgage banking income, consisting of net gains on loan origination/sales activities, was significantly higher increasing $58.8 million, or 180%, compared to 2019, due to higher production and sales, including an increase in refinance volume, due primarily to a decline in long-term interest rates. Total secondary market mortgage loan production was $2.22 billion in 2020, an increase of $1.33 billion, or 148%, compared to 2019. 

Capital markets income primarily includes fee income from customer derivative transactions. Additionally, capital markets income includes fee income from capital raising investment banking transactions and foreign exchange as well as other 

miscellaneous income from capital market transactions. Capital markets income decreased $3.2 million, or 10%, from 2019, primarily due to lower fees on customer derivative transactions with lower activity due to COVID-19. 

Income from BOLI, which includes increases in the cash surrender value of policies and proceeds from insurance benefits, increased $10.1 million, or 47%, compared to 2019, primarily driven by additional investments of $250.0 million in BOLI policies in 2020 and income on proceeds from insurance benefits, which totaled $3.8 million compared to $760 thousand in 2019. 

Investment securities gains, net, of $78.9 million, reflected strategic repositioning of the portfolio during 2020. The transactions were primarily focused on agency mortgage-backed securities, but also included the disposition of Synovus' remaining $155.0 million in asset-backed securities. 

Gain on sale and increase/(decrease) in the fair value of private equity investments for 2020 included realized gains from the sale of positions in two publicly traded equity investments, offset partially by write-downs on two smaller remaining investments. 

The main components of other non-interest revenue are fees for letters of credit and unused lines of credit, safe deposit box fees, access fees for ATM use, other service charges and loan servicing fees, income from insurance commissions, gains from sales of GGL/SBA loans, and other miscellaneous items. Other non-interest revenue was up $15.1 million, or 45%, for 2020 and included higher loan servicing fees of $3.4 million primarily from the restructuring of our third-party lending partnership arrangements, a sale-leaseback gain of $2.4 million associated with a bank office property, a gain of $2.5 million from the sale of non-relationship mortgage loans, and a favorable valuation adjustment of $3.0 million for solar tax credit investments. 

Non-interest Expense 

Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.18 billion, an increase of $80.6 million, or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. During 2020, Synovus recognized a $44.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge representing the goodwill allocated to the Consumer Mortgage reporting unit. Adjusted non-interest expense, which excludes goodwill impairment, restructuring charges, loss on early extinguishment of debt, earnout liability adjustments, merger-related expense and certain other items, for 2020 increased $68.9 million, or 7%, compared to 2019. The increase in adjusted expense was largely driven by mortgage production commissions, consulting expense associated with Synovus Forward, PPP and COVID-19 related expenses, and investments in talent and technology. The efficiency ratio-FTE for 2020 was 58.32% compared to 56.22% in 2019, and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 55.74% compared to 51.82% in 2019. See "Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures" of this Report for applicable reconciliation to GAAP measures. 

The following table summarizes non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

Salaries and other personnel expense increased $48.2 million, or 8%, compared to 2019, due primarily to higher mortgage production-based commissions of $26.3 million, higher bonus payments of $16.3 million, including PPP and COVID-19 related 

bonus payments, and general investments in talent. Synovus employees totaled 5,247, down 142, or 3%, from December 31, 2019. 

Net occupancy, equipment, and software expense increased $7.8 million, or 5%, compared to 2019, driven primarily by investments in technolog y including upgrades to our mobile and online banking portal, online account origination capabilities, and other digital touchpoints . Synovus Bank's branch network consisted of 289 and 298 branches at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Third-party processing and other services expense includes all third-party core operating system and processing charges as well as third-party loan servicing charges. Third-party processing expense increased $7.3 million, or 10%, compared to 2019 primarily due to loan growth from Synovus' consumer-based lending partnerships during the first half of 2020. During 2020, Synovus restructured certain of its third-party consumer-based lending partnership arrangements with a shift of new originations to held for sale and thereby reduced third-party loan servicing expens e during the second half of 2020. Third-party processing expense also included $2.0 million in upfront processing fees associated with the PPP forgiveness process. 

Professional fees increased $21.6 million, or 61%, compared to 2019, due primarily to increases in consulting fees related to Synovus' internal revenue growth and efficiency initiative announced in January 2020, Synovus Forward. 

FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees decreased $6.5 million, or 20%, compared to 2019 due primarily to strategic balance sheet management actions, aimed at reducing FDIC expense. 

Advertising expense decreased $7.0 million, or 33%, from 2019, driven by an intentional response to COVID-19 reflected by a lower level of traditional sponsorships and campaigns. 

During the third quarter of 2020, Synovus recognized a $44.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge representing the goodwill allocated to the Consumer Mortgage reporting unit resulting from a combination of factors including the extended duration of lower market valuations, high volumes in refinance activity that have reduced mortgage yields, and the clarity around longer term policy actions designed to keep interest rates low. 

As part of its Synovus Forward initiative, Synovus recorded restructuring charges of $27.0 million, consisting largely of sev erance charges of $15.6 million, during the year ended December 31, 2020. Severance charges included $13.7 million in one-time termination benefits associated with a voluntary early retirement program offered to employees in the latter part of 2020. During 2020, Synovus also recorded $10.5 million in lease termination charges and asset impairment charges related to branch closures and restructuring of corporate real estate. Synovus Bank operated 289 branches at December 31, 2020, compared to 298 branches at December 31, 2019, following the closing of 13 branches during 2020 and opening of 4 new branches. 

During 2020, Synovus utilized excess liquidity and debt proceeds from debt issued by Synovus Bank in 2020 and terminated $1.13 billion in long-term FHLB obligations and redeemed $250.0 million in subordinated notes, incurring $10.5 million in losses on early extinguishment of debt. During 2019, Synovus repositioned certain assets and liabilities to improve portfolio performance and lower funding costs and incurred a $4.6 million loss on early extinguishment of debt from the termination of an assumed $150.0 million long-term FHLB obligation from the FCB acquisition. 

Earnout liability fair value adjustments associated with the Global One acquisition are the result of higher than projected earnings and higher earnings estimates over the remaining contractual earnout period, reflecting the continued success of the Global One enterprise. The earnout period ends on June 30, 2021. 

In connection with the FCB acquisition, Synovus incurred merger-related expense of $56.6 million and $10.1 million, in 2019 and 2018, respectively, which primarily related to employment compensation agreements, severance, and professional services. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 - Acquisitions" in this Report for more information on the acquisition of FCB. 

Other operating expenses include travel, insurance, network and communication, other taxes, subscriptions and dues, other loan and ORE expense, postage and freight, training, business development, supplies, donations, fair value adjustments to the Visa derivative, and other miscellaneous expenses. Other operating expenses were down $4.1 million for 2020 compared to 2019 largely due to declines in travel expense of $6.9 million as a result of COVID-19. Additionally, expense associated with fair value adjustments to the Visa derivative was lower with $890 thousand in 2020, compared to $3.6 million in 2019. Other operating expenses for 2020 also included a $2.7 million valuation adjustment on a MPS receivable and a $2.5 million charge from termination of customer swap s. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense was $111.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $201.2 million and $118.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was 22.9%, 26.3% and 21.7%, respectively. The federal statutory rate was 21% in each year. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2019 to 2020 was largely driven by the recognition of discrete benefits partly offset by the non-deductible impairment of goodwill. Additionally, the effective tax rate in 2019 was higher largely due to non-deductible merger-related expenses associated with the FCB acquisition. 

On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the CARES Act which includes various provisions impacting the calculation of income taxes. In the first quarter of 2020, Synovus recognized a discrete tax benefit of $2.7 million related to an NOL carryback claim as permitted by the Act. The Company also estimates the payment of approximately $8.3 million of employer payroll taxes otherwise due in 2020 will be delayed, with 50% due by December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% by December 31, 2022. The Company continues evaluating the implication of the CARES Act on its operations and with the exception of these and certain state concessions, we do not expect the provisions of the CARES Act to have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s current tax provision. 

Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. At December 31, 2020, net deferred tax assets were $130.8 million compared to $65.1 million at December 31, 2019. 

Synovus currently expects to realize the $130.8 million in net deferred tax assets well in advance of the statutory carryforward period. At December 31, 2020, $10.5 million, or 8%, of the net deferred tax asset relates to federal and state NOLs which have expiration dates beginning in 2023 through 2034. State tax credits at December 31, 2020 total $8.6 million and have expiration dates through the tax year 2030. Additionally, $111.8 million of the net deferred tax assets have no expiration date as of December 31, 2020. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 18 - Income Taxes" of this Report for additional discussion regarding deferred income taxes. 

Credit Quality 

Synovus continuously monitors the quality of its loan portfolio by industry, property type, geography, as well as credit quality metrics. At December 31, 2020, credit quality remained relatively stable with NPA and NPL ratios of 0.50% and 0.39%, respectively, and total past dues of 0.12%. While our entire loan portfolio is continuously assessed, enhanced monitoring continues for industries most affected by COVID-19. Elevated risk remains and is largely concentrated in hospitality-related segments including hotels and full-service restaurants.

Non-performing Assets 

Total NPAs were $192.1 million at December 31, 2020, a $54.6 million, or 40%, increase from $137.4 million at December 31, 2019. Total NPAs as a percentage of total loans, other loans held for sale, ORE and specific other assets increased 13 basis points to 0.50% at December 31, 2020 compared to 0.37% at December 31, 2019. The increase in NPAs compared to December 31, 2019 was mostly isolated to a few larger commercial relationships being designated as non- 

performing. NPLs were $151.1 million at December 31, 2020, a $49.4 million, or 49%, increase from $101.6 million at December 31, 2019.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

At December 31, 2020, TDRs (accruing and non-accruing) were $174.0 million, an increase of $23.8 million, or 16%, compared to December 31, 2019. Accruing TDRs were $135.0 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $133.1 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.8 million. Non-accruing TDRs of $39.0 million at December 31, 2020 increased $22.0 million from December 31, 2019. The primary driver of the increase in non-accruing TDRs compared to December 31, 2019 is a result of two large TDR relationships being downgraded to non-accruing. 

Accruing TDRs are considered performing because they are performing in accordance with the restructured terms. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 99% of accruing TDRs were current . In addition, subsequent defaults on accruing TDRs (defaults defined as the earlier of the TDR being placed on non-accrual status or reaching 90 days past due with respect to principal and/or interest payments within twelve months of the TDR designation) have continued to remain at lower levels with seven defaults with a recorded investment of $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to four defaults with a recorded investment of $326 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Non-TDR Modifications due to COVID-19 

Regulatory agencies have encouraged financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of COVID-19. In the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (initially issued on March 22, 2020 and revised on April 7, 2020), for example, the regulatory agencies expressed their view of loan modification programs as positive actions that may mitigate adverse effects on borrowers due to COVID-19 and their unwillingness to criticize institutions for working with borrowers in a safe and sound manner. Moreover, the Interagency Statement provided that eligible loan modifications related to COVID-19 may be accounted for under section 4013 of the CARES Act or in accordance with ASC 310-40. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, extended the applicable period of Section 4013 of the CARES Act. This allows banks to elect to not consider loan modifications related to COVID-19 that are made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of January 1, 2022, or 60 days after the national emergency ends to borrowers that are current (i.e. less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019) as TDRs. The regulatory agencies further stated that performing loans granted payment deferrals due to COVID-19 are not considered past due or non-accrual. FASB confirmed the foregoing regulatory agencies' view, that such short-term modifications (e.g., six months) made on a good-faith basis in response to COVID-19 for borrowers who are current are not TDRs. 

Beginning in late March 2020, Synovus provided relief programs consisting primarily of 90-day payment deferral relief to borrowers negatively impacted by COVID-19 and has primarily accounted for these loan modifications in accordance with ASC 310-40. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, upon evaluation of facts and circumstances, the CARES Act was elected for certain loan modifications that met the criteria of Section 4013 of the CARES Act. The deferred payments along with interest accrued during the deferral period are generally due and payable on the maturity date of the existing loan. Based on the terms of the deferral relief program, which did not provide for forgiveness of interest, Synovus recognized interest income on loans during the deferral period. As of December 31, 2020, 0.3% of the total loan portfolio was in a P&#38;I deferral status, down significantly from approximately 15% of the total loan portfolio that had been granted P&#38;I deferral through our relief programs as of the filing of our first quarter 2020 10-Q. In addition to our P&#38;I deferment program, under the CARES Act, we have also provided borrowers who have been impacted during the current crisis with other modifications such as interest only relief or amortization extensions on approximately 2% of total loans. 

Past Due Loans 

As a percentage of total loans outstanding, loans 30 or more days past due and still accruing interest were 0.12% and 0.33% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of total loans outstanding, loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest were 0.01% and 0.04% at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. These loans are in the process of collection, and management believes that sufficient collateral value securing these loans exists to cover contractual interest and principal payments. 

Criticized and Classified Loans 

Our loan ratings are aligned to federal banking regulators' definitions of pass and criticized categories, which include special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. Substandard accruing and non-accruing loans, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as classified. Special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as criticized and classified loans. The following table presents a summary of criticized and classified loans. The increase in criticized and classified loans at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 was primarily due to increases in special mention and substandard accruing loans in the hotel industry as a result of COVID-19.

Potential Problem Loans 

Potential problem loans are defined by management as certain performing loans with a well-defined weakness where there is information about possible credit problems of borrowers which causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present repayment terms of such loans. Potential problem commercial loans were $374.2 million and $222.3 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and consist of substandard accruing loans (included in criticized and classified loans) but exclude both loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest and substandard accruing TDRs, which are reported separately. Management&#8217;s current expectation of probable losses from potential problem loans is included in the ACL, and management cannot predict at this time whether these potential problem loans ultimately will become NPLs or result in losses. 

For more information, see the loan portfolio class by risk grade tables and additional information in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses" in this Report. 

Net Charge-offs 

Total 2020 net charge-offs were $94.7 million, or 0.24%, of average loans, compared to total net charge-offs of $57.6 million, or 0.16% of average loans in 2019. 

Provision for Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) 

Provision for credit losses (which includes the provisions for loan losses and unfunded commitments) of $355.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflected the building of the ACL required under CECL primarily as a result of uncertainty and deterioration in the economic environment due to the impact of COVID-19. The provision for loan losses was $87.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The ACL at December 31, 2020 totaled $653.5 million consisting of an ALL of $605.7 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments of $47.8 million, resulting in an ACL to loans coverage ratio of 1.71% and an ACL to NPLs ratio of 433%. Excluding PPP loans, the ACL to loan coverage ratio was 1.81%. Under the incurred loss methodology, reserves for credit losses were recognized only when the losses were probable or had been incurred; under CECL, companies are required to recognize the full amount of expected credit losses for the lifetime of the financial assets, based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 

The ACL at December 31, 2020 utilized a two-year reasonable and supportable period and comprised a multi-scenario framework including a base economic outlook which incorporates the most recently enacted stimulus with modest economic growth and improvement in the unemployment rate throughout 2021 and 2022. The ALL at December 31, 2019 was $281.4 million, or 0.76% of total loans, applying the incurred loss impairment guidance.

Capital Resources 

Synovus and Synovus Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by our primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve. Synovus and Synovus Bank measure capital adequacy using the standardized approach under Basel III. At December 31, 2020, Synovus and Synovus Bank's capital levels remained strong and exceeded well-capitalized requirements currently in effect. The following table presents certain ratios used to measure Synovus and Synovus Bank's capitalization.

At December 31, 2020, Synovus' CET1 ratio increased to 9.66%, well in excess of regulatory requirements including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The December 31, 2020 CET1 ratio improved 71 basis points compared to December 31, 2019 driven by a combination of earnings and balance sheet activities. Synovus' total risk-based capital ratio increased by 117 basis points to 13.42% compared to December 31, 2019 including the impact of subordinated debt optimization during the fourth quarter of 2020 with the issuance of $200.0 million by Synovus Bank and redemption of $250.0 million by Synovus. For more information on regulatory capital requirements, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12 - Regulatory Capital" in this Report. Management reviews the Company's capital position on an on-going basis and believes, based on internal capital analyses and earnings projections, that Synovus is well positioned to meet relevant regulatory capital standards. 

On August 26, 2020, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule (following an interim final rule issued on March 27, 2020) that allowed electing banking organizations that adopted CECL during 2020 to mitigate the estimated effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in transition period. Synovus adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 and the December 31, 2020 regulatory capital ratios reflect Synovus' election of the five-year transition provision. At December 31, 2020, $90.0 million, or a cumulative 22 basis points benefit to CET1, was deferred. For additional information on CECL, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in this Report. 

As a result of the greater economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, Synovus suspended its share repurchase activity beyond the $16.2 million of common stock repurchased during the first quarter of 2020. During 2019, 

Synovus repurchased $725.0 million of common stock. 

Parent Company 

The Parent Company&#8217;s net assets consist primarily of its investment in Synovus Bank. The P arent Company&#8217;s primary uses of cash are for the servicing of debt, payment of dividends to shareholders, and repurchases of common stock. The Parent Company also provides the necessary funds to strengthen the capital of its subsidiaries if needed. These uses of cash are primarily funded by dividends from Synovus Bank, borrowings from external sources, and equity offerings. 

During 2020, Synovus Bank and non-bank subsidiaries paid upstream cash dividends to th e Parent Company totaling $547.5 million. D uring 2019, Synovus Bank paid upstream cash dividends to the Parent Company totaling $400.0 million and during 2018, Synovus Bank and non-bank subsidiaries made upstream cash distributions to the Parent Company totaling $260.0 million including cash dividends of $250.0 million. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers and creditors, to support asset growth, and to otherwise sustain operations of Synovus and its subsidiaries, at a reasonable cost, on a timely basis, and without adverse consequences. ALCO monitors Synovus' economic, competitive, and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk. 

In accordance with Synovus policies and regulatory guidance, ALCO evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the Company's liquidity profile. Synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors, borrowers, and creditors on a timely basis. Liquidity is generated through various sources, including, but not limited to, maturities and repayments of loans by customers, maturities and sales of investment securities, and growth in core or wholesale deposits. Management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage customer deposit withdrawals, loan requests, and other funding demands. 

Synovus Bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Synovus Bank accesses these funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of funding and liquidity. Synovus Bank also has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the FHLB system and through the Federal Reserve discount window. During 2020, Synovus increased its FHLB availability by over $2.0 billion through expanding pledged collateral. At December 31, 2020, based on currently pledged collateral, Synovus Bank had access to FHLB funding of $6.48 billion, subject to FHLB credit policies. 

In addition to bank level liquidity management, Synovus must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, share repurchases, payment of general corporate expenses, and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries. The primary source of liquidity for Synovus consists of dividends from Synovus Bank, which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the GA DBF and the Federal Reserve Bank. Synovus' ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank's future profits, asset quality, liquidity, and overall condition. In addition, both the GA DBF and Federal Reserve Bank may require approval to pay dividends, based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations. 

During 2020, Synovus Bank issued $400.0 million in senior notes and $200.0 million in subordinated debt with proceeds from the offerings used to extinguish long-term debt obligations. Synovus terminated $1.13 billion in long-term FHLB obligations and redeemed $250.0 million in subordinated notes and incurred $10.5 million in losses on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2020. For additional information on these offerings, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 - Long-term Debt and Short-term Borrowings" i n this Report. 

Synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above, including existing liquid funds on hand, are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs. However, if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate, regulatory capital requirements for Synovus or Synovus Bank were to increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise, or Synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels, then Synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources. See "Part I &#8211; Item 1A. Risk Factors - Credit and Liquidity - Changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity and financial results" and " - Market and Other General Risk - The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and will likely continue to adversely impact, Synovus&#8217; business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations." Furthermore, Synovus may, from time to time, take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance its existing debt, redeem its preferred stock, or strengthen its liquidity or capital position. 

Contractual Cash Obligations 

The following table summarizes, by remaining maturity, Synovus&#8217; significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2020. Excluded from the table below are certain liabilities with variable cash flows and/or no contractual maturity. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies" of this Report for information on Synovus' commitments to extend credit including loan commitments and letters of credit along with obligations related to Synovus' sponsorship of MPS businesses. Additionally, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 - Deposits" of this Report for information on contractual maturities of time deposits.

Earning Assets and Sources of Funds 

Average total assets for 2020 increased $5.35 billion, or 11%, to $52.14 billion as compared to average total assets of $46.79 billion for 2019. Average earning assets increased $4.55 billion, or 11%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year and represented 91.8% of average total assets for 2020, as compared to 92.6% in 2019. The increase in average earning assets resulted primarily from a $2.89 billion, or 8% increase in average loans, net, which included average PPP loans of $1.87 billion, a $969.8 million increase in interest-bearing funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank, a $265.2 million increase in loans held for sale, and a $251.4 million increase in investment securities available for sale. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities for 2020 of $34.12 billion increased $2.15 billion, or 7%, from $31.97 billion in 2019. Average money market deposits and average interest-bearing demand deposits increased $3.49 billion, or 31%, and $1.20 billion, or 19%, respectively, from 2019. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in average time deposits of $2.20 billion, or 22%, and a decrease in other short-term borrowings of $630.9 million, or 56%. Average non-interest-bearing demand deposits also increased $2.57 billion, or 27%, to $11.93 billion compared to 2019. Deposits overall were up significantly from 2019 due largely to client preferences for maintaining liquidity as well as government stimulus programs which further supported deposit growth, partially offset by strategic declines in average time deposits. 

For more detailed information on the average balance sheets for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, refer to Table 12 - Average Balances, Interest, and Yields/Rates. 

The table below shows the maturities of total commercial loans as of December 31, 2020. Also provided are the amounts due after one year, classified according to the sensitivity in interest rates. Actual repayments of loans may differ from the contractual maturities reflected therein because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with and without prepayment penalties. Additionally, the refinancing of such loans or the potential delinquency of such loans could create differences between the contractual maturities and the actual repayment of such loans.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The measures entitled adjusted non-interest revenue; adjusted non-interest expense; adjusted total revenues; adjusted tangible efficiency ratio; adjusted return on average assets; adjusted net income available to common shareholders; adjusted net income per common share, diluted; adjusted return on average common equity; return on average tangible common equity; adjusted return on average tangible common equity; and tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The most comparable GAAP measures to these measures are total non-interest revenue, total non-interest expense, total revenues, efficiency ratio-FTE, return on average assets, net income available to common shareholders, net income per common share, diluted, return on average common equity, and the ratio of total shareholders&#8217; equity to total assets, respectively. 

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about Synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating Synovus&#8217; operating results, financial strength, the performance of its business, and the strength of its capital position. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors, and since they are not required to be uniformly applied, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies. Adjusted non-interest revenue and adjusted total revenues are measures used by management to evaluate non-interest revenue and total revenues exclusive of net investment securities gains (losses) as well as gain on sale and changes in fair value of private equity investments, net. Adjusted non-interest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs. Adjusted return on average assets, adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted net income per common share, diluted, and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. The return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity are measures used by management to compare Synovus&#8217; performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization, thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio is used by management to assess the strength of our capital position. The computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below.
