 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Executive Summary 

The following financial review provides a discussion of Synovus' financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations as well as a summary of Synovus' critical accounting policies. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Report. 

Economic Environment and Recent Events 

The 2022 U.S. economy has been substantially impacted by high inflation that began in the middle of 2021. As a result, the Federal Reserve aggressively tightened monetary policy with the FOMC raising market interest rates 425 bps during 2022, and rates have since increased in early 2023 primarily due to persistent inflation that remains the largest headwind to the U.S. economy. The extent of interest rate increases and the period of time that higher rates will remain in effect depends greatly on the level of inflation and strength of the labor market. 

Economic uncertainty and market disruptions outside of inflation remain, including geopolitical tensions primarily from Russia&#8217;s prolonged war in Ukraine, the relationship between the U.S. and China, and to a lesser extent, the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global supply chains, tourism, business travel, immigration, and labor participation. However, these geopolitical uncertainties have served to strengthen the value of the U.S. dollar as global investors flock to higher quality U.S. assets. 

U.S. fiscal policy has been expansionary since 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but government support is declining, while leaving a significant federal deficit and a looming Congressional debt ceiling debate in 2023. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law in August 2022, which raises federal revenue by imposing an alternative corporate minimum tax if certain thresholds are met and a non-deductible excise tax on corporate share repurchases, while increasing federal spending to address climate change and reduce prescription drug and healthcare costs for lower-income households and seniors. While the IRA does not have a significant immediate impact on Synovus, it represents a shift from expansionary towards contractionary federal fiscal policy. 

Despite certain economic headwinds discussed above, with an asset-sensitive balance sheet and our position in Southeast U.S. markets, Synovus believes it is well-positioned to execute on our 2023 outlook outlined below by focusing on productivity gains within our core businesses, continuing to benefit from contributions generated through our new growth initiatives and key talent additions, while maintaining a cautious and resilient risk profile through capital management, deposit generation across all business lines, and overall credit vigilance. 

Overview of 2022 Financial Results 

Net income available to common shareholders for 2022 was $724.7 million, or $4.95 per diluted common share, compared to $727.3 million, or $4.90 per diluted common share, in 2021. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by the rising rate environment, as the target Fed Funds rate increased 425 bps in 2022. Strong loan growth in 2022 contributed to a provision for credit losses of $84.6 million compared to provision reversals of $106.3 million in 2021, as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic began to subside, and increased economic uncertainty related to inflationary concerns and geopolitical tensions increased. 

Net interest income for 2022 was $1.80 billion, up $264.0 million, or 17%, from $1.53 billion in 2021, including $12.6 million in PPP fees during 2022 and $79.2 million in 2021. The net interest margin was 3.34% for 2022, an increase of 33 bps from 3.01% in 2021, aided by higher loan yields from increased market interest rates partially offset by higher deposit and wholesale funding costs. 

Non-interest revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $409.3 million, down $40.7 million, or 9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 due primarily to industry-wide lower mortgage banking income and a decline in other non-interest revenue resulting from valuation adjustments on equity method investments partially offset by strong growth in core banking fees (1) and higher wealth revenue (2) . 

Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1.16 billion, an increase of $57.6 million, or 5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in non-interest expense during 2022 primarily resulted from elevated performance incentives, merit and inflationary wage increases, headcount additions, resumption of normal business activities post-COVID-19, investments in new business initiatives and technology and operations infrastructure spend. 

At December 31, 2022, total loans, net of deferred fees and costs of $43.72 billion, increased $4.40 billion, or 11%, from December 31, 2021. Growth was primarily in C&#38;I and CRE loans, driven by strong commercial production, increased line utilization as well as lower levels of pay-off activity. 

At December 31, 2022, credit quality metrics remained stable and at or near historical lows with NPA and NPL ratios of 0.33% and 0.29%, respectively, and total past dues of 0.15%, as a percentage of total loans. Net charge-offs for 2022 remained low at 0.13% of average loans, compared to 0.20% in 2021. The ACL at December 31, 2022 totaled $500.9 million, an increase of $31.4 million compared to December 31, 2021, resulting primarily from loan growth and an increase in unfunded commitments, mostly offset by decreased specific reserves and continued positive trends in our credit performance. The ACL to loans coverage ratio was 1.15% at December 31, 2022, a 4 bps decline from December 31, 2021. 

Total period-end deposits were $48.87 billion at December 31, 2022, down $555.7 million, compared to year-end 2021, impacted by rate-driven outflows and normal client liquidity deployment. O verall deposit costs for 2022 were 38 bps, up 22 bps, compared to 16 bps for 2021, and were impacted by the FOMC's rate hikes in 2022, but also benefited from prudent pricing strategy and an extended lag on deposit pricing. 

Our CET1 ratio of 9.63% at December 31, 2022 is well in excess of regulatory requirements and increased 13 bps compared to December 31, 2021, as over 70% of organic earnings for 2022 were retained to support core client growth while also returning approximately 30% to our shareholders through our common dividend. The Board recently approved a capital plan that includes a $0.04 increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.38 per share , beginning with the quarterly dividend payable in April 2023, and authorized share repurchases of up to $300 million in 2023. Our capital priorities are focused on supporting core client growth and managing the CET1 ratio within our target operating range of 9.25% to 9.75%.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of Synovus are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as &#8220;critical accounting policies,&#8221; consisting of those related to the accounting for the allowance for credit losses and income taxes. In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, Synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management's practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors' Audit Committee on a periodic basis, including the development, selection, implementation, and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on Synovus&#8217; consolidated financial statements. Synovus&#8217; financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are applied in the application of these policies. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL is a critical accounting estimate that requires significant judgments and assumptions, which are inherently subjective. The use of different estimates or assumptions could have a significant impact on the provision for credit losses, ACL, financial condition, and results of operations. The economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly, and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower. 

In accordance with CECL, the ACL, which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments, represents management's best estimate of expected losses over the life of loans adjusted for prepayments, and over the life of loan commitments expected to fund. Synovus' loans and unfunded loan commitments are grouped based upon the nature of the loan type and the forecasted PD, adjusted for relevant forecasted macroeconomic factors comprising multiple weighted scenarios representing different plausible outcomes, and LGD, to determine the allowance for the majority of our portfolio. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments and curtailments when appropriate. To the extent the lives of the loans in the portfolio extend beyond the period for which a reasonable and supportable forecast can be made (which is two years for Synovus), the Company reverts, on a straight-line basis back to the historical rates over a one-year period. Life-of-loan loss percentages may also be adjusted, as necessary, for certain quantitative and qualitative factors that in management's judgment are necessary to reflect losses expected in the portfolio. These adjustments address inherent limitations in the quantitative model. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are individually evaluated on a loan-by-loan basis with specific reserves, if any, recorded as appropriate. Given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within an economic forecast, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the ACL. As a result, when formulating the quantitative estimate management uses a probability-weighted approach that incorporates a baseline forecast, an upside scenario reflecting an accelerated recovery, a downside scenario that reflects adverse economic conditions, and a scenario that assumes consistent slow growth that is less optimistic than the baseline. 

To illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, management calculated a quantitative allowance using only the downside scenario. This downside scenario includes a severe deterioration in economic conditions compared to our baseline forecast. The downside forecast assumes a recession starting in the first quarter of 2023, as well as worsening inflation pressures which cause the Fed to raise interest rates higher than currently expected. Our quantitative CECL model is most sensitive to the unemployment rate, which peaks near 8% in the downside scenario, compared to the multi-scenario forecast&#8217;s weighted average peak of around 5%. Excluding the impact of qualitative considerations, using only the downside forecast scenario would result in a hypothetical increase over our reported ACL of approximately $296 million at December 31, 2022. 

The sensitivity analysis result does not represent management&#8217;s view of expected credit losses nor is it intended to estimate future changes in allowance levels for reasons including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process; 

&#8226; the impact of changes in economic variables are interrelated and nonlinear; therefore, the results of the analysis cannot be extrapolated to additional changes in economic variables; 

&#8226; subsequent changes in the mix of portfolio characteristics could materially impact results; 

&#8226; potential future government or regulatory intervention could cause results to differ materially from historical relationships between the economic variables and related credit metrics; and 

&#8226; the sensitivity analysis does not account for any quantitative or qualitative adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework to reflect losses expected in the portfolio. 

See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses" in this Report for additional details. 

Income Taxes 

The calculation of Synovus&#8217; income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination. As part of Synovus&#8217; overall business strategy, management must consider tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances under consideration. As such, the Company is often required to exercise significant judgment regarding the interpretation of these tax laws and regulations, in which Synovus' anticipated and actual liability could significantly vary based upon the taxing authority&#8217;s interpretation. Specifically, significant estimates in accounting for income taxes relate to the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, estimates of the realizability of deferred tax assets, including income tax credits and NOLs, and the need for a valuation allowance, the calculation of taxable income, the estimation of uncertain tax positions and the determination of temporary differences between book and tax bases. Adjustments to these items may occur due to modifications in tax rates, newly enacted laws, issuance of tax regulations, resolution of items with taxing authorities, alterations to interpretative statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance that affects the Company&#8217;s tax positions, changes in the Company's tax accounting methods or elections, or other facts and circumstances. Management closely monitors tax developments and the potential timing of these changes in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the Company&#8217;s overall tax position and the estimates and judgments used in determining the income tax provision and records adjustments as necessary. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 - Income Taxes" in this Report for additional details. 

DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Investment Securities Available for Sale 

The investment securities portfolio consists primarily of high-quality liquid debt securities classified as available for sale. The on-going investment philosophy for the securities portfolio focuses on maintaining a readily accessible source of liquidity while also supporting the income and interest rate risk management objectives of the Company. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 - Investment Securities Available for Sale" in this Report for additional information. 

The average balance of investment securities available for sale increased to $11.21 billion in 2022 from $9.60 billion in 2021, representing 20.7% and 18.8%, respectively, of average interest earning assets. The portfolio earned a taxable-equivalent yield of 1.87% and 1.46% for 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the estimated fair value of investment securities available for sale as a percentage of their amortized cost was 85.8% and 99.3%, respectively, with net unrealized losses increasing to $1.60 billion from $73.2 million, respectively, due to increases in market interest rates. The investment securities portfolio had a weighted average duration of 5.3 years at December 31, 2022, compared to 3.7 years at December 31, 2021. 

The calculation of weighted average yields for investment securities available for sale displayed below is based on the amortized cost with effective yields also based upon contractual cash flows. Maturity information is presented based upon contractual maturity which may differ from actual maturity dates as issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

At December 31, 2022, total loans, net of deferred fees and costs, of $43.72 billion, increased $4.40 billion, or 11%, from December 31, 2021. This included a $384.9 million decline in PPP loans, primarily from forgiveness, and growth primarily in C&#38;I and CRE loans, driven by strong commercial production, increased line utilization as well as lower levels of pay-off activity. We expect loan growth in 2023 of 5% to 9%. 

C&#38;I loans remain the largest component of our loan portfolio, representing 50.5% of total loans, while CRE and consumer loans represent 28.9% and 20.6%, respectively. Our portfolio composition is guided by our strategic growth plan, in conjunction with a comprehensive concentration management policy which sets limits for C&#38;I, CRE, and consumer loan levels as well as sub-categories therein. 

U.S. Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) 

Synovus participated in the PPP, which is a loan program that originated from the CARES Act. The total balance of all PPP loans, net of unearned fees and costs, was $14.7 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to $399.6 million as of December 31, 2021. The decline of $384.9 million, or 96%, from 2021 was largely due to $378 million in forgiveness. The table below provides additional information on PPP loans.

Total commercial loans (which are comprised of C&#38;I and CRE loans) at December 31, 2022 were $34.72 billion, or 79.4%, of the total loan portfolio, compared to $30.64 billion, or 77.9% at December 31, 2021.

The C&#38;I loan portfolio represents the largest category of Synovus' loan portfolio and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a diverse set of industries. The following table shows the composition of the C&#38;I loan portfolio aggregated by NAICS industry name and code. In accordance with Synovus' lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process which incorporates uniform underwriting standards and oversight in proportion to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. As of December 31, 2022, 94.4% (94.5% excluding PPP loans) of Synovus' C&#38;I loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventory, and other types of collateral compared to 92.2% (94.1% excluding PPP loans) as of December 31, 2021. C&#38;I loans grew $2.44 billion, or 12%, from December 31, 2021, as diverse growth from many of our Wholesale Banking sub-businesses and a slow down in pay-off activity were only slightly offset by a decline in PPP loans primarily due to forgiveness. The growth largely consisted of funded loan production and increased line utilization particularly in the finance and insurance, health care and social assistance, real estate and rental and leasing, manufacturing, and accommodation and food services industries.

At December 31, 2022, $13.87 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 31.8% of the total loan portfolio (including PPP loans of $14.7 million net of unearned fees and costs), represented loans for the purpose of financing commercial, financial, and agricultural business activities. The primary source of repayment on these loans is revenue generated from products or services offered by the business or organization. The secondary source of repayment is the collateral, which consists primarily of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, time deposits, cash surrender value of life insurance, and other business assets. 

At December 31, 2022, $8.19 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 18.7% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing owner-occupied properties. The financing of owner-occupied facilities is considered a C&#38;I loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral. This treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The secondary source of repayment on these loans is the underlying real estate. These loans are predominately secured by owner-occupied and other real estate, and to a lesser extent, other types of collateral. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

CRE loans primarily consist of income-producing investment properties loans. Additionally, CRE loans include 1-4 family properties loans as well as land and development loans. Total CRE loans of $12.65 billion increased $1.64 billion, or 15%, from December 31, 2021 primarily due to growth from funded loan production and construction line utilization, primarily in the multi-family and medical office sectors, as well as a deceleration in pay-off activity. 

Investment Properties Loans 

Investment properties loans consist of construction and mortgage loans for income-producing properties and are primarily made to finance multi-family properties, office buildings, hotels, shopping centers, warehouses and other commercial development properties. Total investment properties loans as of December 31, 2022 were $11.64 billion, or 92.0% of the CRE loan portfolio, and 26.6% of the total loan portfolio, up $1.74 billion, or 18%, compared to $9.90 billion, or 89.9% of the CRE loan portfolio, and 25.2% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021. All sub-categories experienced growth with the exception of shopping centers, which was down by $251.5 million, or 15%, from December 31, 2021. 

The following table shows the principal categories of the investment properties loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

(1) Loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total investment properties loans. 

1-4 Family Properties Loans 

1-4 family properties loans include construction loans to home builders and commercial mortgage loans related to 1-4 family rental properties and are almost always secured by the underlying property being financed by such loans. These properties are primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. At December 31, 2022, 1-4 family properties loans totaled $616.9 million, or 4.9% of the CRE loan portfolio, and decreased $28.5 million from December 31, 2021. 

Land and Development Loans 

Land and development loans include commercial and residential development as well as land acquisition loans and are secured by land held for future development, typically in excess of one year. Properties securing these loans are substantially within markets served by Synovus, and loan terms generally include personal guarantees from the principals. Loans in this portfolio are underwritten based on the LTV of the collateral and the capacity of the guarantor(s). Land and development loans of $389.3 million at December 31, 2022 declined $77.5 million from December 31, 2021. 

Consumer Loans 

The consumer loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through Synovus' banking network including first and second residential mortgages, home equity, and consumer credit card loans, as well as both secured and unsecured loans from third-party lending. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, weighted average FICO scores within the residential real estate portfolio based on committed balances were 793 and 792 for home equity and 780 and 777 for consumer mortgages, respectively . 

Consumer loans at December 31, 2022 increased $325.5 million, or 4%, compared to December 31, 2021. Home equity increased $395.6 million from December 31, 2021, largely due to increased demand for home equity products as property values have increased, and interest rates for home equity products have remained low relative to unsecured consumer financing products. Mortgage loans increased $145.4 million from December 31, 2021 despite lower production, largely due to slower prepayments and refinances as a result of substantial increases in mortgage rates. Other consumer loans decreased $215.0 million from December 31, 2021, as third-party lending payment activity more than offset purchases of $514.5 million. 

The table below shows the maturities of loans, net of deferred fees and costs, as of December 31, 2022. Also provided are the amounts due after one year, classified according to the sensitivity in interest rates. Actual repayments of loans may differ from the contractual maturities reflected therein because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with and without prepayment penalties. Additionally, the refinancing of such loans or the potential delinquency of such loans could create differences between the contractual maturities and the actual repayment of such loans.

Tot al period-end deposits were $48.87 billion at December 31, 2022, down $555.7 million, or 1%, compared to year-end 2021, impacted by rate-driven outflows and normal client liquidity deployment. Core deposits decreased $3.02 billion , or 6% , compared to December 31, 2021 with declines in most categories, mostly offset by a $2.46 billion increase in brokered deposits. On an average basis, total deposits of $48.94 billion were up $1.33 billion, or 3%, compared to the prior year, driven primarily by growth in non-interest-bearing demand deposits as this meaningful component of our overall funding strategy has helped manage our total funding costs in the rising rate environment. O verall deposit costs for 2022 were 38 bps, up 22 bps, compared to 16 bps for 2021, and were impacted by the FOMC's rate hikes of 425 bps in 2022, but also benefited from prudent pricing strategy and an extended lag on deposit pricing. 

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, $25.08 billion and $25.91 billion, respectively, of our deposit portfolio was uninsured. The uninsured amounts are estimated based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory reporting requirements.

Net Interest Income 

The following table summarizes the components of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, including the tax-equivalent adjustment that is required in making yields on tax-exempt loans and investment securities comparable to taxable loans and investment securities. The taxable-equivalent adjustment is based on a 21% federal income tax rate for the three years shown.

Net interest income (interest income less interest expense) is the largest component of total revenue, representing earnings from the primary business of gathering funds from client deposits and other sources, and investing those funds primarily in loans and fixed-income securities. Synovus&#8217; long-term objective is to manage those assets and liabilities to maximize net interest income while balancing interest rate, credit, liquidity, and capital risks. 

Net Interest Margin 

Net interest margin is a measure of the spread between interest earning assets relative to the cost of funding and can be used to assess the efficiency of earnings from balance sheet activities. The net interest margin is affected by changes in interest earning asset yields, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, the percentage of interest earning assets funded by non-interest-bearing funding sources, and the mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

The net interest margin was 3.34% for 2022, an increase of 33 bps from 3.01% in 2021, due primarily to the increase in market interest rates, as the Company's overall asset sensitive position results in a benefit to net interest income in a rising rate environment, in addition to average growth in loans, net of deferred fees and costs, and investment securities available for sale. 2022 also included $12.6 million in PPP fees, a decline of $66.6 million compared to $79.2 million in 2021. The yield on earning assets increased 60 bps to 3.84% from 3.24% in 2021, while the effective cost of funds increased 27 bps to 0.50% from 0.23% in 2021. 

The primary components of the yield on interest earning assets are loan yields, yields on investment securities, and the yield on balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank. Loan yields increased 49 bps as a result of the FOMC's rate hikes, and yields on investment securities increased 41 bps due primarily to higher reinvestment yield and lower prepayments compared to 2021. The increase in average loans was primarily attributable to growth in commercial production and line utilization in addition to a deceleration in pay-off activity. Earning asset yields were also positively impacted by the decrease in cash balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank as compared to the prior year. 

The increase in the effective cost of funds during 2022 was primarily driven by increases in market interest rates despite disciplined deposit pricing. 

Earning Assets and Sources of Funds 

Average total assets for 2022 increased $2.24 billion, or 4%, to $57.61 billion as compared to average total assets of $55.37 billion for 2021. Average interest earning assets increased $3.05 billion, or 6%, in 2022 as compared to the prior year and represented 94.1% of average total assets for 2022, as compared to 92.4% in 2021. The increase in average earning assets resulted primarily from a $3.07 billion increase in average total loans, net of deferred fees and costs, which included a decrease of $1.40 billion in average PPP loans, and a $1.61 billion increase in average investment securities available for sale. These increases were partially offset by a $1.74 billion decrease in average interest-bearing funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities for 2022 of $34.88 billion increased $1.16 billion, or 3%, from $33.72 billion in 2021. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities resulted largely from a $796.3 million, or 66%, increase in long-term debt primarily from FHLB advances, a $616.2 million increase in brokered deposits, a $466.2 million increase in other short-term borrowings largely due to FHLB advances, and a $326.6 million increase in average interest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by a $963.3 million, or 27%, decrease in average time deposits largely as a result of rate-driven and normal client liquidity deployment. 

Average non-interest bearing demand deposits increased $1.43 billion, or 9%, compared to 2021, as these deposits continue to be a meaningful component of our funding strategy and have helped manage total funding costs in the rising rate environment.

(1) Changes in net interest income are attributed to either changes in average balances (volume change) or changes in average rates (rate change) for earning assets and sources of funds on which interest is received or paid. Volume change is calculated as change in volume times the previous rate, while rate change is change in rate times the previous volume. 

(2) Reflects taxable-equivalent adjustments, using the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, in adjusting interest on tax-exempt loans to a taxable-equivalent basis. 

Non-interest Revenue 

Non-interest revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $409.3 million, down $40.7 million, or 9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 due primarily to industry-wide lower mortgage banking income, a decline in other non-interest revenue resulting from valuation adjustments on equity method investments, and lower BOLI income from decreased life insurance proceeds partially offset by strong growth in core banking fees (1) and higher wealth revenue (2) . 

The following table shows the principal components of non-interest revenue.

(1) Core banking fees consist of service charges on deposit accounts, card fees, and other non-interest revenue components including letter of credit fees, ATM fee income, line of credit non-usage fees, gains (losses) from sales of SBA loans, and miscellaneous other service charges. 

(2) Wealth revenue consists of fiduciary and asset management, brokerage, and insurance revenue. 

Service charges on deposit accounts, consisting of account analysis fees, NSF fees, and all other service charges, increased during 2022 compared to 2021 . The largest category of service charges, account analysis fees, were $40.1 million for 2022, up $1.4 million, or 4%, from 2021. NSF fees for 2022 and 2021 comprised 32% and 31%, respectively, of service charges on deposit accounts and 7% and 6%, respectively, of total non-interest revenue. All other service charges on deposit accounts, which consist primarily of monthly fees on consumer demand deposits and small business accounts, were $23.1 million for 2022, up $1.8 million, or 8%, compared to 2021. 

Fiduciary and asset management fees are derived from providing estate administration, personal trust, corporate trust, corporate bond, investment management, financial planning, and family office services. The slight increase in fiduciary and asset management fees for 2022 was driven by solid client acquisition despite headwinds from a decline in the equity markets. 

Card fees consist primarily of credit card interchange fees, debit card interchange fees, and merchant revenue. Card fees are reported net of certain associated expense items including client loyalty program expense and network expense. Merchant revenue relates to the fees that are charged to merchant clients based on a percentage of their credit or debit card transaction volume amounts. The strong increase in 2022 from 2021 resulted from increased transaction volumes from both consumer and commercial spend activity and account growth as we continue to invest in our Treasury and Payment solutions business as well as higher merchant revenue. 

Brokerage revenue consists primarily of brokerage commissions as well as advisory fees earned from the management of client assets. The increase in 2022 over 2021 was largely driven by benefits from client activity including movement into short-term investments such as repurchase agreements in the face of challenging equity markets. 

Mortgage banking income, consisting of net gains on loan origination/sales activities, was significantly lower compared to 2021, driven largely by the continued depressed residential mortgage environment with substantial increases in mortgage rates reducing refinancing and new-purchase volumes and compressing secondary margins. Gains on sale declined $32.8 million as a result of $913.1 million, or 54%, lower loan sales and a $870.8 million, or 54%, decrease in secondary market mortgage production compared to 2021. 

Capital markets income primarily includes fee income from client derivative transactions. Additionally, capital markets income includes fee income from debt capital market transactions and foreign exchange as well as other miscellaneous income 

from capital market transactions. The increase for 2022 was primarily a result of a $1.6 million increase in loan syndication arranger fees partially offset by a $834 thousand decrease in fees on client derivative transactions. 

Income from BOLI, includes increases in the cash surrender value of policies and proceeds from insurance benefits. The decrease in 2022 was driven by a $8.0 million decrease in proceeds from insurance benefits. 

The main components of other non-interest revenue are fees for letters of credit and unused lines of credit, safe deposit box fees, access fees for ATM use, other service charges and loan servicing fees, income from insurance commissions, earnings on equity method investments, gains (losses) from sales of SBA loans, and other miscellaneous items. 2022 included a $7.0 million write-down on a minority Fintech investment and an $8.5 million decrease compared to 2021 related to unfavorable valuation adjustments on tax-related equity investment partnerships. 2022 also included a $6.9 million reduction in the fair value of non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets (offset in non-interest expense). 

Non-interest Expense 

Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1.16 billion, an increase of $57.6 million, or 5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in non-interest expense during 2022 primarily resulted from elevated performance incentives, merit and inflationary wage increases, headcount additions, resumption of normal business activities post-COVID-19, investments in new business initiatives and technology and operations infrastructure spend. 

The following table summarizes non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.

Salaries and other personnel expense increased compared to 2021, primarily due to the impacts of elevated performance incentives, merit and inflationary wage increases, and headcount additions partially offset by a reduction in the fair value of the non-qualified deferred compensation liability (offset in non-interest revenue) and lower mortgage production-based commissions. Synovus employees totaled 5,114, up 126, or 3%, from December 31, 2021 as a result of headcount additions in areas associated with strategic revenue growth and certain critical support functions. 

Net occupancy, equipment, and software expense increased compared to 2021, due primarily to continued investments in technology and operations infrastructure partially offset by savings from branch closures. Synovus Bank operated 246 branches at December 31, 2022, compared to 281 branches at December 31, 2021, following the closing of 36 branches and opening of 1 new branch during 2022. 

Third-party processing and other services expense includes all third-party core operating system and processing charges as well as third-party loan servicing charges. Third-party processing expense increased compared to 2021, mostly due to enhancements associated with technology and operations infrastructure investments and new business initiatives somewhat offset by higher 2021 expense associated with PPP loan forgiveness. 

Professional fees increased compared to 2021, primarily from higher consulting fees largely related to new business initiatives, technology and operations infrastructure investments, sustainability strategies for our clients, and increased legal fees from various matters, including new business initiatives and credit-related items. 

FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees increased compared to 2021, largely due to higher assessment rates primarily driven by asset growth, funding composition, and redemption of Synovus Bank's 2.289% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes. In October 2022, the FDIC voted to increase the deposit insurance assessment rate by 2 bps beginning in the first quarter of 2023, which will significantly increase FDIC insurance expense industry-wide in 2023. 

During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, S ynovus recorded restructuring charges (reversals) of $(9.7) million and $7.2 million, respectively, which included $364 thousand and $2.3 million, respectively, of severance charges. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, $4.8 million and $4.6 million, respectively, in lease termination charges and asset impairment charges were recorded related to branch closures and restructuring of corporate real estate as part of a large-scale property optimization program. Asset impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were net of $15.4 million and $5.4 million, respectively, in gains on sales of certain building and branch locations, including the sale of real estate facilities in Columbus, Georgia in 2022. 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, Synovus recorded $6.0 million in valuation adjustments to the Visa derivative following Visa's announcements to authorize the deposit of funds into its litigation escrow account, which totaled $950 million in 2022. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of this Report for additional information on the Visa derivative. 

On February 10, 2022, Synovus Bank redeemed its 2.289% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Bank Senior Notes of $400 million par value and incurred a $677 thousand loss on early extinguishment of debt. 

Other operating expense includes advertising, travel, insurance, network and communication, other taxes, subscriptions and dues, other loan and ORE expense, postage and freight, training, business development, supplies, donations, and other miscellaneous expense. The increase over prior year was primarily related to an increase in fraud-related losses and other operational losses, loan expense due to elevated production, resumption of normal business activities post-COVID-19, and increased 2022 advertising expense resulting from the launch of our newly developed brand positioning and campaign. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense was $206.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $228.9 million and $111.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 21.4%, 23.1% and 22.9%, respectively. The most significant factor of the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2022 compared to the prior year related to changes in the composition of state tax and apportionment rates. 

Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. At December 31, 2022, net deferred tax assets were $595.3 million compared to $169.1 million at December 31, 2021. 

Synovus regularly assesses the realizability of its net deferred tax assets based upon all available evidence, both positive and negative. Based upon the assessment, Synovus established a valuation allowance of $19.1 million at December 31, 2022 and $19.0 million at December 31, 2021, on the portion of its federal and state NOLs that are not expected to be utilized prior to expiration in years 2027 through 2042. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 - Income Taxes" of this Report for additional discussion regarding deferred income taxes. 

Credit Quality 

Synovus diligently monitors the quality of its loan portfolio by industry, property type, and geography through a thorough portfolio review process and our analytical risk management tools. At December 31, 2022, credit quality metrics remained stable and at or near historical lows with NPA and NPL ratios of 0.33% and 0.29%, respectively, and total past dues of 0.15%, as a percentage of total loans. Net charge-offs for 2022 remained low at $53.2 million, or 0.13%, of average loans.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

At December 31, 2022, TDRs (accruing and non-accruing) were $156.7 million, an increase of $14.6 million, or 10%, compared to December 31, 2021. Accruing TDRs were $146.8 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of $27.0 million, or 23%, compared to December 31, 2021. The mix of accruing TDRs has changed from December 31, 2021 as certain pass-rated loans that met the criteria for removal of TDR designation were offset by accruing substandard loans modified primarily through interest rate concessions previously accounted for under the CARES Act. 

Accruing TDRs are considered performing because they are performing in accordance with the restructured terms. At December 31, 2022 approximately 99% of accruing TDRs were current compared to 98% at December 31, 2021 . In addition, subsequent defaults on accruing TDRs (defaults defined as the earlier of the TDR being placed on non-accrual status or reaching 90 days past due with respect to principal and/or interest payments within twelve months of the TDR designation) have continued to remain at lower levels with five defaults with a recorded investment of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to eight defaults with a recorded investment of $978 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Non-TDR Modifications due to COVID-19 

The Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus provided that eligible loan modifications related to COVID-19 may be accounted for under section 4013 of the CARES Act or in accordance with ASC 310-40. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 extended the applicable period of Section 4013 of the CARES Act which allowed banks to elect to not consider loan modifications related to COVID-19 made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of January 1, 2022, or 60 days after the national emergency ends to borrowers that are current (i.e. less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019) as TDRs. The regulatory agencies further stated that performing loans granted payment deferrals due to COVID-19 are not considered past due or non-accrual. FASB confirmed the foregoing regulatory agencies' view, that such short-term modifications (e.g., six months) made on a good-faith basis in response to COVID-19 for borrowers who are current are not TDRs. 

As of December 31, 2021, we provided borrowers who were impacted by COVID-19 with other modifications such as interest-only relief or amortization extensions on less than 2% of total loans. The CARES Act election period ended on January 1, 2022. 

Past Due Loans 

As a percentage of loans outstanding, loans 30 or more days past due and still accruing interest were 0.15% at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. As a percentage of loans outstanding, loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest were 0.01% and 0.02% at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These loans are in the process of collection, and management believes that sufficient collateral value securing these loans exists to cover contractual interest and principal payments. 

Criticized and Classified Loans 

Our loan ratings are aligned to federal banking regulators' definitions of pass and criticized categories, which include special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. Substandard accruing and non-accruing loans, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as classified. Special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred 

to as criticized and classified loans. The following table presents a summary of criticized and classified loans. Criticized and classified loans at December 31, 2022 declined $85.9 million, or 8%, compared to December 31, 2021.

Provision for (reversal of) Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses of $84.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 included net charge-offs of $53.2 million and compares to a reversal of provision for credit losses of $106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 that included net charge-offs of $77.8 million. 2022 results reflect a deterioration in the economic outlook for 2023 and 2024 and strong loan growth, while 2021 results benefited from an improvement in the economic outlook as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic began to subside. $10.5 million and $38.6 million, respectively, in reserves were also added as a result of purchases of $514.5 million and $1.62 billion, respectively, of third-party lending loans for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

The ALL of $443.4 million and the reserve for unfunded commitments of $57.5 million, which is recorded in other liabilities, comprise the total ACL of $500.9 million at December 31, 2022. The ACL increased $31.4 million compared to the December 31, 2021 ACL of $469.5 million, which consisted of an ALL of $427.6 million and the reserve for unfunded commitments of $41.9 million. The ACL to loans coverage ratio of 1.15% at December 31, 2022 was 4 bps lower compared to December 31, 2021. The increase in the ACL from December 31, 2021 resulted primarily from loan growth and an increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments, largely due to an increase in both reserve rates and the level of unfunded commitments, mostly offset by decreased specific reserves and continued positive trends in our credit performance.

Capital Resources 

Synovus and Synovus Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by our primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve. Synovus and Synovus Bank measure capital adequacy using the standardized approach under Basel III. At December 31, 2022, Synovus and Synovus Bank's capital levels remained strong and exceeded well-capitalized requirements currently in effect. The following table presents certain ratios used to measure Synovus and Synovus Bank's capitalization.

At December 31, 2022, Synovus' CET1 ratio was 9.63%, well in excess of regulatory requirements including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The December 31, 2022 CET1 ratio increased 13 bps compared to December 31, 2021, as over 70% of organic earnings for 2022 were retained to support core client growth while also returning approximately 30% to our shareholders through our common dividend. For more information on regulatory capital requirements, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 - Regulatory Capital" in this Report. In 2023, we will continue to prioritize capital deployment toward client growth and will remain mindful of the evolving economic environment as we manage within our target CET1 ratio range of 9.25% to 9.75%. 

On January 18, 2023, Synovus announced that its Board of Directors approved a capital plan that includes a $0.04 increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.38 per share , beginning with the quarterly dividend payable in April 2023, and authorized share repurchases of up to $300 million in 2023. 

On January 20, 2022, Synovus announced that its Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $300 million in 2022, and during the year ended December 31, 2022, Synovus repurchased a total of $13.0 million, or 281 thousand shares, of its common stock, at an average price of $46.17 per share. 

On August 26, 2020, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule that allowed electing banking organizations that adopted CECL during 2020 to mitigate the estimated effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in transition period. Synovus adopted CECL on January 1, 2020, and the December 31, 2022 regulatory capital ratios reflect Synovus' election of the five-year transition provision. At December 31, 2022, $43.7 million, or a cumulative 9 bps benefit to CET1, was deferred. For additional information on CECL, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in this Report. 

Parent Company 

The Parent Company&#8217;s net assets consist primarily of its investment in Synovus Bank. The P arent Company&#8217;s primary uses of cash are for the servicing of debt, payment of dividends to shareholders, and repurchases of common stock. The Parent Company also provides the necessary funds to strengthen the capital of its subsidiaries if needed. These uses of cash are primarily funded by dividends from Synovus Bank, borrowings from external sources, and equity offerings. 

During 2022, Synovus Bank paid upstream cash dividends to th e Parent Company totaling $350.0 million. D uring 2021, Synovus Bank paid upstream cash dividends to the Parent Company totaling $420.0 million, and during 2020, Synovus Bank and non-bank subsidiaries paid upstream cash dividends to the Parent Company totaling $547.5 million. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers and creditors, to support asset growth, and to otherwise sustain operations of Synovus and its subsidiaries, at a reasonable cost, on a timely basis, and without adverse consequences. ALCO monitors Synovus' economic, competitive, and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk. 

In accordance with Synovus policies and regulatory guidance, ALCO evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the Company's liquidity profile. Synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors, borrowers, and creditors on a timely basis. Liquidity is generated through various sources, including, but not limited to, maturities and repayments of loans by clients, maturities and sales of investment securities, and growth in core and wholesale deposits. 

Synovus Bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Synovus Bank accesses these funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of funding and liquidity. Synovus Bank also has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the FHLB system and through the Federal Reserve discount window. At December 31, 2022, based on currently pledged collateral, Synovus Bank had access to FHLB funding of $2.78 billion, subject to FHLB credit policies. Management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage client deposit withdrawals, loan requests, and other funding demands. 

In addition to bank level liquidity management, Synovus must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, payment of general corporate expense, and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries. The primary source of liquidity for Synovus consists of dividends from Synovus Bank, which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the GA DBF and the Federal Reserve Bank. Synovus' ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank's future profits, asset quality, liquidity, and overall condition. In addition, both the GA DBF and Federal Reserve Bank may require approval to pay dividends, based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations. 

Synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above, including existing liquid funds on hand, are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs. However, if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate, regulatory capital requirements for Synovus or Synovus Bank were to increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise, or Synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels, then Synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources. See "Part I &#8211; Item 1A. Risk Factors - Credit and Liquidity - Changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity and financial results." Furthermore, Synovus may, from time to time, take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance its existing debt, redeem its preferred stock, share repurchases, or strengthen its liquidity or capital position. 

Contractual Cash Obligations 

The following table summarizes, by remaining maturity, Synovus&#8217; significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2022. Excluded from the table below are certain liabilities with variable cash flows and/or no contractual maturity. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies" of this Report for information on Synovus' commitments to extend credit including loan commitments and letters of credit along with obligations related to Synovus' sponsorship of MPS businesses. Additionally, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 - Deposits" of this Report for information on contractual maturities of time deposits and "Part II - Item 8.

See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of this Report for further information. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The measures entitled adjusted non-interest revenue; adjusted non-interest expense; adjusted revenue; adjusted tangible efficiency ratio; adjusted return on average assets; adjusted net income available to common shareholders; adjusted net income per common share, diluted; adjusted return on average common equity; return on average tangible common equity; adjusted return on average tangible common equity; the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, adjusted pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) ex. PPP revenue, and adjusted PPNR are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The most comparable GAAP measures to these measures are total non-interest revenue, total non-interest expense, total TE revenue, efficiency ratio-TE, return on average assets, net income available to common shareholders, net income per common share, diluted, return on average common equity, the ratio of total shareholders&#8217; equity to total assets, and PPNR, respectively. 

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about Synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating Synovus&#8217; operating results, financial strength, the performance of its business, and the strength of its capital position. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors, and since they are not required to be uniformly applied, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies. Adjusted non-interest revenue and adjusted revenue are measures used by management to evaluate non-interest revenue and total TE revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains (losses) and fair value adjustments on non-qualified deferred compensation. Adjusted non-interest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs. Adjusted return on average assets, adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted net income per common share, diluted, and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. Return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity are measures used by management to compare Synovus&#8217; performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization, thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio is used by management to assess the strength of our capital position. Adjusted PPNR ex. PPP revenue is used by management to evaluate pre-provision net revenue exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons including PPP revenue. Adjusted PPNR is used by management to evaluate PPNR exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. The computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below. 

Management does not provide a reconciliation for forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the occurrence and the financial impact of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of Synovus&#8217; control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, Synovus&#8217; management is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.
