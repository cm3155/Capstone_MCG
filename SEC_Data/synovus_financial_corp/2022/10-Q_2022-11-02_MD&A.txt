FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain statements made or incorporated by reference in this Report which are not statements of historical fact, including those under &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; and elsewhere in this Report, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of, and subject to the protections of, Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to Synovus' beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, targets, expectations, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions and future performance and involve known and unknown risks, many of which are beyond Synovus' control and which may cause Synovus' actual results, performance or achievements or the financial services industry or economy generally, to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. 

All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements through Synovus' use of words such as &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;assumes,&#8221; &#8220;predicts,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;potential&#8221; and other similar words and expressions of the future or otherwise regarding the outlook for Synovus' future business and financial performance and/or the performance of the financial services industry and economy in general. Forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of Synovus' management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this document. Many of these factors are beyond Synovus' ability to control or predict. These factors include, but are not limited to: 

(1) the risk that competition in the financial services industry, including competition from nontraditional banking institutions such as Fintechs, may adversely affect our future earnings and growth; (2) the risk that we may not realize the expected benefits from our strategic initiatives or that we may not be able to realize growth and efficiency gains in the time period expected, which could regularly affect our future profitability; (3) the risk that an economic downturn and contraction, including a recession, could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, credit quality, results of operations and future growth, including the risk that the strength of the current economic environment could be weakened by inflation, current supply chain challenges, and the continued impact of COVID-19; (4) our ability to attract and retain employees and the impact of senior leadership transitions that are key to our strategic initiatives; (5) risks related to our strategic implementation of new lines of business, new products and services, and new technologies and an expansion of our existing business opportunities with a renewed focus on innovation; (6) the risk that prolonged periods of inflation could have on our business, profitability and our stock price; (7) changes in the interest rate environment, including changes to the federal funds rate, and competition in our primary market area may result in increased funding costs or reduced earning assets yields, thus reducing margins and net interest income; (8) changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market; (9) restrictions or limitations on access to funds from historical and alternative sources of liquidity could adversely affect our overall liquidity, which could restrict our ability to make payments on our obligations and our ability to support asset growth and sustain our operations and the operations of Synovus Bank; (10) the risk that we may be required to make substantial expenditures to keep pace with regulatory initiatives and the rapid technological changes in the financial services industry; (11) the impact of recent and proposed changes in governmental policy, laws and regulations, proposed and recently enacted changes in monetary policy and in the regulation and taxation of banks and financial institutions, or the interpretation or application thereof and the uncertainty of future implementation and enforcement of these regulations, including the risk of inflationary pressure and interest rate increases; (12) the risk that our current and future information technology system enhancements and operational initiatives may not be successfully implemented, which could negatively impact our operations; (13) risks related to our business relationships with, and reliance upon, third parties that have strategic partnerships with us or that provide key components of our business infrastructure, including the costs of services and products provided to us by third parties, and risks related to disruptions in service or financial difficulties with a third-party vendor or business relationship; 

(14) the risk that our enterprise risk management framework, our compliance program, or our corporate governance and supervisory oversight functions may not identify or address risks adequately, which may result in unexpected losses; (15) risks that our asset quality may deteriorate or that our allowance for credit losses may prove to be inadequate or may be negatively affected by credit risk exposures; (16) risks related to the ability of our operational framework to identify and manage risks associated with our business, such as credit risk, compliance risk, reputational risk, and operational risk, including by virtue of our relationships with third-party business partners, as well as our relationships with third-party vendors and other service providers; (17) the risk that we may be exposed to potential losses in the event of fraud and/or theft, or in the event that a third-party vendor, obligor, or business partner fails to pay amounts due to us under that relationship or under any arrangement that we enter into with them; (18) our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks, such as data security breaches, malware, "denial of service" attacks, "hacking" and identity theft, a failure of which could disrupt our business and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption or damage of our systems, increased costs, significant losses, or adverse effects to our reputation; (19) the impact on our financial results, reputation, and business if we are unable to comply with all applicable federal and state regulations or other supervisory actions or directives and any necessary capital initiatives; (20) the risks that if economic conditions worsen further or regulatory capital rules are modified, we may be required to undertake initiatives to improve or conserve our capital position; (21) the risks and uncertainties related to the impact of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic on our assets, business, capital and liquidity, financial condition, prospects and results of operations; (22) our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends or take other capital actions; (23) risks related to our ESG strategies and initiatives, the scope and pace of which could alter our reputation and shareholder, employee, client and third-party relationships; (24) risks related to the continued use, availability and reliability of LIBOR and the risks related to the transition from LIBOR to any alternate reference rate we may use; (25) the risk that we may not be able to identify suitable bank and non-bank acquisition opportunities as part of our growth strategy and even if we are able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms or realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions; (26) the risk that we could realize losses if we sell non-performing assets and the proceeds we receive are lower than the carrying value of such assets; (27) risks related to regulatory approval to take certain actions, including any dividends on our common stock or preferred stock, any repurchases of common stock or any other issuance or redemption of any other regulatory capital instruments; (28) the risk that our concentrated operations in the Southeastern U.S. make us vulnerable to local economic conditions, local weather catastrophes, public health issues and other external events; (29) the costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto; (30) risks related to the fluctuation in our stock price and general volatility in the stock market; (31) the effects of any damages to our reputation resulting from developments related to any of the items identified above; and (32) other factors and other information contained in this Report and in other reports and filings that we make with the SEC under the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, those found in "Part II - Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Report.

Executive Summary 

Net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2022 was $194.8 million, or $1.33 per diluted common share, compared to $178.5 million, or $1.21 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2021. Net income available to common shareholders for the first nine months of 2022 was $527.3 million, or $3.60 per diluted common share, compared to $535.2 million, or $3.59 per diluted common share for the first nine months of 2021. The year-over-year changes for all time periods were largely impacted by higher net interest income from increased interest rates as well as strong loan growth. Increased economic uncertainty related to inflationary concerns and geopolitical tensions resulted in provision for credit losses of $25.6 million and $49.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, and reversals of $7.9 million and $51.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. 

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $1.30 billion, up $154.9 million, or 14%, compared to the same period in 2021, including $12.2 million in PPP fees during 2022 and $66.5 million in 2021. Net interest margin was up 22 bps over the comparable nine - month period to 3.24%, due primarily to interest rate increases and disciplined deposit pricing partially offset by funding mix and a $54.3 million decline in PPP fees. Net interest margin for the third quarter was 

3.49%, up 27 bps sequentially, aided by higher loan yields from increased interest rates partially offset by higher deposit and wholesale funding costs. 

Non-interest revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $104.3 million, down $10.7 million, or 9%, compared to the third quarter of 2021, and year-to-date was $306.9 million, down $26.1 million, or 8%, compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to lower mortgage banking income partially offset by higher core banking fees (service charges on deposit accounts, card fees, and several other non-interest revenue components, including letter of credit fees, ATM fee income, line of credit non-usage fees, gains (losses) from sales of SBA loans, and miscellaneous other service charges) and higher wealth revenue (fiduciary and asset management, brokerage, and insurance revenue). 

Non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2022 was $294.0 million , up $27.0 million, or 10%, while year-to-date non-interest expense of $848.5 million was up $43.8 million, or 5%, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase in non-interest expense during 2022 was primarily due to an increase in expense associated with elevated performance incentives, merit and inflationary wage increases, headcount additions, resumption of normal business activities post COVID-19, and investments in new growth initiatives and technology and operations infrastructure. 

At September 30, 2022, loans, net of deferred fees and costs, of $42.57 billion, increased $3.26 billion, or 8%, from December 31, 2021. Excluding a $356.8 million decline in PPP loans, primarily from forgiveness, loans increased $3.62 billion, or 9%, led by growth in C&#38;I and CRE loans, driven by an increase in commercial production and line utilization as well as a deceleration in pay-off activity. 

At September 30, 2022, credit metrics remained stable overall and at or near historically low levels with NPAs at 32 bps, NPLs at 29 bps, and total past dues at 15 bps, as a percentage of total loans. Net charge-offs remained low at $4.7 million, or 4 bps annualized, and $39.9 million, or 13 bps annualized, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. The ACL at September 30, 2022 totaled $479.3 million, a slight increase of $9.8 million from December 31, 2021, which resulted primarily from loan growth and an increase in unfunded commitments mostly offset by decreased specific reserves and continued positive trends in our credit performance. The ACL to loans coverage ratio at September 30, 2022 was 1.13%, 6 bps lower compared to December 31, 2021 due to overall improvement in economic factors, primarily the unemployment rate. 

Total period-end deposits at September 30, 2022 decreased $1.73 billion compared to December 31, 2021 as lower money market, public funds, interest-bearing demand, and time deposits, driven by client liquidity deployment and rate-related outflows, were somewhat offset by increases in brokered deposits and non-interest-bearing demand deposits. Total deposit costs were 38 bps during the third quarter of 2022, up 23 bps compared to the sequential quarter, and up 25 bps from the prior year comparable period, primarily due to the impact of the Federal Open Market Committee's rate hikes during 2022. 

At September 30, 2022, Synovus' CET1 ratio of 9.52% improved 2 bps compared to December 31, 2021, driven by strong capital generation from earnings mostly offset by significant growth in risk-weighted assets, largely from loan growth, and return of capital primarily through common stock shareholder dividends. 

More detail on Synovus' financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 may be found in subsequent sections of "Item 2. &#8211; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Report. See also "Part 1 &#8211; Item 1A. &#8211; Risk Factors" of Synovus' 2021 Form 10-K.

&#8226; Adjusted revenue (excluding PPP revenue)* growth of 15% to 16%

(*) See "Table 15 - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; in this Report for applicable reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure. 

Changes in Financial Condition 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, total assets increased $1.32 billion to $58.64 billion. We deployed liquidity as cash and cash equivalents decreased $1.14 billion, and total loans increased $3.26 billion, with commercial production and line utilization continuing to drive growth in addition to a deceleration in pay-off activity. Investment securities available for sale decreased $1.33 billion, driven by net unrealized losses from increases in market interest rates. Deposits decreased $1.73 billion, as lower money market, public funds, interest-bearing demand, and time deposits, driven by client liquidity deployment and rate-related outflows, were somewhat offset by increases in brokered deposits and non-interest-bearing demand deposits. The loan to deposit ratio was 89.3% at September 30, 2022, higher as compared to 84.0% at June 30, 2022 and 79.5% at December 31, 2021. Long-term debt increased $3.23 billion from December 31, 2021, largely due to long-term FHLB advances of $3.30 billion and $350.0 million par value 2025 Parent Company senior debt issued in August 2022. 

Total shareholders' equity at September 30, 2022 decreased $1.07 billion compared to December 31, 2021, primarily driven by an increase in after-tax net unrealized losses on investment securities available for sale and cash flow hedges of $1.23 billion and $216.5 million, respectively, due to increases in market interest rates. The decline was partially offset by growth in retained earnings, which included net income of $552.1 million and common and preferred stock dividends of $148.3 million and $24.9 million, respectively. 

Loans 

The following table compares the composition of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2022, December 31, 2021, and September 30, 2021.

At September 30, 2022, loans, net of deferred fees and costs of $42.57 billion, increased $3.26 billion, or 8%, from December 31, 2021. This included a $356.8 million decline in PPP loans, primarily from forgiveness, and growth primarily in C&#38;I and CRE loans, driven by an increase in commercial production and line utilization as well as a deceleration in pay-off activity. As a result of our strong loan growth of 3% in the third quarter of 2022, guidance for 2022 total loan growth excluding PPP loans has been increased to approximately 11%, which suggests fourth quarter of 2022 loan growth will taper a bit as compared to the growth levels delivered in the third quarter of 2022. 

C&#38;I loans remain the largest component of our loan portfolio, representing 49.8% of total loans, while CRE and consumer loans represent 28.9% and 21.3%, respectively. Our portfolio composition is guided by our strategic growth plan, complemented by a comprehensive concentration management policy, which sets limits for C&#38;I, CRE, and consumer loan levels as well as for underlying sub-categories. 

U.S. Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) 

Synovus participated in the PPP, which is a loan program originating with the CARES Act. The total balance of all PPP loans was $42.8 million as of September 30, 2022, down $356.8 million, or 89%, compared to $399.6 million as of December 31, 2021, primarily due to $351 million in forgiveness. The table below provides additional information on PPP loans.

Commercial Loans 

Total commercial loans (which are comprised of C&#38;I and CRE loans) at September 30, 2022 were $33.50 billion, or 78.7% of the total loan portfolio, compared to $30.64 billion, or 77.9%, at December 31, 2021. 

Commercial and Industrial Loans 

The C&#38;I loan portfolio represents the largest category of Synovus' loan portfolio and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a wide range of industries as well as certain specialized lending verticals. The following table shows the composition of the C&#38;I loan portfolio aggregated by NAICS code. In accordance with Synovus' lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process, which incorporates uniform underwriting standards and oversight in proportion to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. As of September 30, 2022, 93.9% (94.1% excluding PPP loans) of Synovus' C&#38;I loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventory, and other types of collateral compared to 92.2% (94.1% excluding PPP loans) as of December 31, 2021. C&#38;I loans at September 30, 2022 grew $1.59 billion, or 8%, from December 31, 2021, as diverse growth from many of our Wholesale Banking sub-businesses and slower pay-off activity were partially offset by a $356.8 million decline in PPP loan balances. The growth largely consisted of funded loan production and increased line utilization, particularly in the finance and insurance, healthcare and social assistance, accommodation and food services, real estate and rental and leasing, and manufacturing industries.

At September 30, 2022, $13.25 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 31.1% of the total loan portfolio (including PPP loans of $42.8 million net of unearned fees and costs), represented loans originated for the purpose of financing commercial, financial and agricultural business activities. The primary source of repayment on these loans is revenue generated from products or services offered by the business or organization. The secondary source of repayment is the collateral, which consists primarily of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, time deposits, cash surrender value of life insurance, and other business assets. 

At September 30, 2022, $7.96 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 18.7% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing owner-occupied properties. The financing of owner-occupied facilities is considered a C&#38;I loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral. This treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The secondary source of repayment on these loans is the underlying real estate. These loans are predominantly secured by owner-occupied and other real estate and, to a lesser extent, other types of collateral. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

CRE loans consist primarily of income-producing investment properties loans. Additionally, CRE loans include 1-4 family properties loans as well as land and development loans. Total CRE loans of $12.29 billion increased $1.27 billion, or 12%, from December 31, 2021, as continued growth from funded loan production and construction line utilization, primarily in the multi-family and medical office sectors, was partially offset by pay-off activity, albeit at a slower pace. 

Investment properties loans consist of construction and mortgage loans for income-producing properties and are primarily made to finance multi-family properties, hotels, office buildings, shopping centers, warehouses and other commercial development properties. Total investment properties loans as of September 30, 2022 were $11.24 billion, or 91.5% of the CRE loan portfolio, and increased $1.34 billion, or 13%, from December 31, 2021, primarily due to growth in all sub-categories, with the exception of shopping centers and other investment property, which were down $214.1 million, or 13%, and $22.0 million, or 2%, respectively, from December 31, 2021. 

1-4 Family Properties Loans 

1-4 family properties loans include construction loans to home builders and commercial mortgage loans related to 1-4 family rental properties and are almost always secured by the underlying property being financed by such loans. These 

properties are primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. At September 30, 2022, 1-4 family properties loans totaled $639.6 million, or 5.2% of the CRE loan portfolio, and decreased slightly from December 31, 2021. 

Land and Development Loans 

Land and development loans include commercial and residential development as well as land acquisition loans and are secured by land held for future development, typically in excess of one year. Properties securing these loans are substantially within markets served by Synovus, and loan terms generally include personal guarantees from the principals. Loans in this portfolio are underwritten based on the LTV of the collateral and the capacity of the guarantor(s). Land and development loans of $409.9 million at September 30, 2022 decreased $56.9 million from December 31, 2021. 

Consumer Loans 

The consumer loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through Synovus' banking network, including first and second residential mortgages, home equity and consumer credit card loans, as well as both secured and unsecured loans from third-party lending. As of September 30, 2022, weighted-average FICO scores within the residential real estate portfolio based on committed balances were 778 for consumer mortgages and 792 for home equity, consistent with year-end 2021 scores. 

Consumer loans at September 30, 2022 of $9.07 billion increased $397.1 million, or 5%, compared to December 31, 2021. Home equity grew $346.8 million from December 31, 2021, largely due to increased demand for home equity products as property values have increased, and interest rates for home equity products have remained low relative to unsecured consumer financing products. Mortgage loans increased $97.9 million from December 31, 2021, largely due to slower prepayments and refinances as a result of substantial increases in mortgage rates despite lower production. Other consumer loans decreased $41.5 million from December 31, 2021, primarily resulting from $63.9 million lower third-party loan balances as payment activity more than offset purchases of $514.5 million. 

Deposits 

Deposits provide the most significant funding source for interest earning assets. The following table shows the composition of period-end deposits as of the dates indicated. See Table 12 - Quarter-to-Date Net Interest Income and Rate/Volume Analysis and Table 13 - Year-to-Date Net Interest Income and Rate/Volume Analysis in this Report for information on average deposits including average rates.

(3) Core deposits exclude brokered deposits. 

Total period-end deposits at September 30, 2022 decreased $1.73 billion, or 3%, compared to December 31, 2021, as lower money market, public funds, interest-bearing demand, and time deposits, driven by client liquidity deployment and rate-related outflows, were somewhat offset by increases in brokered deposits and non-interest-bearing demand deposits. On a year-to-date average basis, the increase in total deposits was $1.32 billion, or 3%, driven primarily by $1.42 billion in growth from non-interest-bearing demand deposits, as this meaningful component of our overall funding strategy continues to help manage our total funding costs in the rising rate environment. Total deposit costs of 38 bps for the third quarter of 2022 increased 23 bps and 25 bps, respectively, from the prior quarter and prior year comparable period, primarily due to the impact of the Federal 

Open Market Committee's rate hikes of 150 bps during the third quarter of 2022 and 300 bps from September 30, 2021 to September 30, 2022. We expect a continuation of upward pressure on deposit costs, as would be reasonably expected for this phase of the tightening cycle. 

Non-interest Revenue 

Non-interest revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $104.3 million, down $10.7 million, or 9%, and year-to-date was $306.9 million, down $26.1 million, or 8%, compared to the same periods in 2021. The primary drivers of the decrease compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 were lower mortgage banking income and a $2.7 million decline in gains on equity method investments, while the decline compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 resulted from lower mortgage banking income and a $7.0 million write-down on a minority Fintech investment partially offset by higher core banking fees (1) and higher wealth revenue (2) . 

The following table shows the principal components of non-interest revenue.

(1) Core banking fees consist of service charges on deposit accounts, card fees, and several other non-interest revenue components including letter of credit fees, ATM fee income, line of credit non-usage fees, gains (losses) from sales of SBA loans, and miscellaneous other service charges. 

(2) Consists of fiduciary and asset management, brokerage, and insurance revenue. 

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 compared to September 30, 2021 

Service charges on deposit accounts, consisting of account analysis fees, NSF fees, and all other service charges, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were up compared to the same periods in 2021. The largest category of service charges, account analysis fees, was down 2% compared to the third quarter of 2021, and up slightly by 1% on a year-to-date comparable basis. NSF/overdraft fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 comprised 32% and 30%, respectively, of service charges on deposit accounts and 7% and 6%, respectively, of total non-interest revenue. All other service charges on deposit accounts, which consist primarily of monthly fees on consumer demand deposits and small business accounts, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were up $271 thousand, or 5%, and $1.7 million, or 11%, respectively. 

Fiduciary and asset management fees are derived from providing estate administration, personal trust, corporate trust, corporate bond, investment management, financial planning, and family office services. The decline compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 primarily resulted from volatility in the equity markets, while the increase in fiduciary and asset management fees from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was driven by strong client acquisition despite headwinds from a decline in the equity markets. 

Card fees consist primarily of credit card interchange fees, debit card interchange fees, and merchant discounts. Card fees are reported net of certain associated expense items, including client loyalty program expenses and network expenses. Card fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were up primarily due to higher transaction volumes from both consumer and commercial spend activity and account growth due to continued investment in our Treasury and Payment solutions business in addition to increased merchant revenue resulting from new merchants being added. 

Brokerage revenue consists primarily of brokerage commissions as well as advisory fees earned from the management of client assets. Brokerage revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased over the prior year comparable periods, benefiting from client activity, including movement into short-term investments such as repurchase agreements. 

Mortgage banking income was significantly lower for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the same periods in 2021, largely due to the continued depres sed residential mortgage environment, with substantial increases in mortgage rates reducing refinancing and new-purchase volumes and compressing secondary margins. On a year-to-date basis, gains on sale declined $27.0 million as a result of a $744.2 million, or 54%, decrease in loan sales and a $742.1 million, or 56%, decline in secondary market mortgage production compared to the prior year. 

Capital markets income primarily includes fee income from client derivative tran sactions. Additionally, capital markets income includes fee income from debt capital market transactions and foreign exchange as well as other miscellaneous income from capital market transactions. The decline for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily resulted from a $720 thousand decrease in loan syndication arranger fees. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to $730 thousand higher loan syndication arranger fees. 

Income from BOLI includes changes in the cash surrender value of policies and proceeds from insurance contracts. 

The main components of other non-interest revenue are fees for letters of credit and unused lines of credit, safe deposit box fees, access fees for ATM use, other service charges and loan servicing fees, gains from sales of GGL/SBA loans, and other miscellaneous items. The nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily included a $7.0 million write-down on a minority Fintech investment, a reduction in the fair value of non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets of $7.4 million (offset in non-interest expense), and a $1.7 million decline in gains from sales of GGL/SBA loans. 

Non-interest Expense 

Non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2022 was $294.0 million , up $27.0 million, or 10%, and year-to-date was $848.5 million, up $43.8 million, or 5%, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase in non-interest expense during 2022 was primarily due to an increase in expense associated with elevated performance incentives, merit and inflationary wage increases, headcount additions, resumption of normal business activities post COVID-19, and investments in new growth initiatives and technology and operations infrastructure. 

The following table summarizes the components of non-interest expense.

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 compared to September 30, 2021 

Salaries and other personnel expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the impacts of elevated performance incentives, merit and inflationary wage increases, and headcount additions partially offset by a reduction in the fair value of the non-qualified deferred compensation liability (offset in non-interest revenue) and lower mortgage production-based commissions. Total headcount of 5,124 was up by 65, or 1%, compared to September 30, 2021 as a result of headcount additions in areas associated with strategic revenue growth and certain critical support functions. 

Net occupancy, equipment, and software expense was flat for the three months ended September 30, 2022 but increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, due primarily to continued investments in technology and operations infrastructure and initiatives partially offset by savings from branch closures. Synovus Bank operated 257 branches at September 30, 2022 compared to 285 branches at September 30, 2021, with twenty-five branch closures during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. We expect to close eleven branches in the fourth quarter of 2022 as we work to complete our large-scale branch optimization program. 

Third-party processing and other services include all third-party core operating system and processing charges as well as third-party loan servicing charges. Third-party processing expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, largely resulting from enhancements associated with technology and operations infrastructure investments and new business initiatives somewhat offset by higher 2021 expense associated with PPP loan forgiveness. 

Professional fees were flat for the three months ended September 30, 2022 but increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily from higher consulting fees largely related to new initiatives, technology and operations infrastructure investments, sustainability strategies, and increased legal fees from various matters, including new initiatives and credit-related items. 

FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, largely due to a higher assessment rate primarily driven by asset growth, funding composition, and redemption of Synovus Bank 2.289% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes. In October 2022, the FDIC voted to increase the deposit insurance assessment rate by 2 bps beginning in the first quarter of 2023, which is approximately 40% of our most recent assessment rate. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2022, Synovus recorded restructuring charges associated with additional branch closures mostly offset by $1.1 million in severance reversals, as affected employees departed the Company before branch closure or moved to other roles within the Company, and $534 thousand in gains on sales of two closed branches. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, Synovus recorded $12.6 million in gains, largely relating to the sale of real estate facilities in Columbus, Georgia in addition to gains on sales of closed branches partially offset by restructuring charges associated with additional branch closures. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, Synovus recorded restructuring charges primarily related to branch closures and restructuring of corporate real estate as part of the Synovus Forward initiative. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, Synovus recorded a $3.5 million valuation adjustment to the Visa derivative following Visa's announcement in June 2022 to fund $600 million to its litigation escrow account. 

On February 10, 2022, Synovus Bank redeemed its 2.289% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Bank Senior Notes of $400 million par value and incurred a $677 thousand loss on early extinguishment of debt. 

Earnout liability fair value adjustments associated with the Global One acquisition were the result of higher than projected earnings and higher earnings estimates over the remaining contractual earnout period, reflecting the continued success of the Global One enterprise. The earnout period ended on September 30, 2021, and the final earnout payment occurred during the third quarter of 2021. 

Other operating expense includes advertising, travel, insurance, network and communication, other taxes, subscriptions and dues, other loan and ORE expense, postage and freight, training, business development, supplies, donations, and other miscellaneous expense. Other operating expense was up for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increases over prior year were primarily related to an increase in client fraud losses and other operational losses, loan expense due to elevated production, resumption of normal business activities post COVID-19, and increased 2022 advertising expense resulting from the launch of our newly developed brand positioning and campaign. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense was $59.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, representing an effective tax rate of 22.7%, compared to income tax expense of $53.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, representing an effective tax rate of 22.4%. 

Income tax expense was $152.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, representing an effective tax rate of 21.6%, compared to income tax expense of $159.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, representing an effective tax rate of 22.2%. The effective tax rate was lower for nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase in net discrete tax benefits recognized during the current period, including share-based compensation, changes in amounts taxable by jurisdictions, and other accrual adjustments, compared to the prior period. 

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law in August 2022, with most provisions effective beginning in the 2023 tax year, including an alternative corporate minimum tax if certain thresholds are met, a non-deductible excise tax on share repurchases, and transferability of certain federal tax credits. We do not expect the provisions of the IRA to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in the near future. 

CREDIT QUALITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 

Credit Quality 

Synovus diligently monitors the quality of its loan portfolio by industry, property type, and geography through a thorough portfolio review process and our analytical risk management tools. At September 30, 2022, credit metrics remained stable overall and at or near historically low levels with NPAs at 32 bps, NPLs at 29 bps, and total past dues at 15 bps, as a percentage of total loans. Net charge-offs were $4.7 million, or 4 bps annualized, and $39.9 million, or 13 bps annualized, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, which represent the lowest net charge-off ratios reported in recent years.

Criticized and Classified Loans 

Our loan ratings are aligned to federal banking regulators' definitions of pass and criticized categories, which include special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. Substandard accruing and non-accruing loans, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as classified. Special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as criticized and classified loans. The following table presents a summary of criticized and classified loans. Criticized and classified loans at September 30, 2022 were 2.2% of total loans, or $928.8 million, down $99.2 million as compared to 2.6% of total loans, or $1.03 billion, at December 31, 2021.

Provision for (Reversal of) Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses of $25.6 million and $49.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 included net charge-offs of $4.7 million and $39.9 million, respectively, and represented loan growth as well as uncertain economic conditions. $3.0 million and $10.5 million in reserves were also added as a result of purchases of $152.9 million and $514.5 million of third-party lending loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

The ALL of $421.4 million and the reserve for unfunded commitments of $57.9 million, which is recorded in other liabilities, comprise the total ACL of $479.3 million at September 30, 2022. The ACL increased $9.8 million compared to the December 31, 2021 ACL of $469.5 million, which consisted of an ALL of $427.6 million and the reserve for unfunded commitments of $41.9 million. The ACL to loans coverage ratio of 1.13% at September 30, 2022 was 6 bps lower compared to December 31, 2021 due to overall improvement in economic factors, primarily the unemployment rate. The slight increase in the ACL from December 31, 2021 resulted primarily from loan growth and an increase in unfunded commitments mostly offset by decreased specific reserves and continued positive trends in our credit performance.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

Accruing TDRs were $118.8 million at September 30, 2022, down $1.0 million compared to December 31, 2021. The mix of accruing TDRs has changed from December 31, 2021 as certain pass-rated loans that met the criteria for removal of TDR designation were offset by accruing special mention or substandard loans modified during 2022 primarily through interest rate concessions that no longer qualify for accounting under the CARES Act and instead are considered accruing TDRs. Non-accruing TDRs were $11.7 million at September 30, 2022, compared to $22.3 million at December 31, 2021. 

Accruing TDRs are considered performing because they are performing in accordance w ith the restructured terms. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, approximately 97% and 98%, respectively, of accruing TDRs were current. In addition, subsequent defaults on accruing TDRs (defaults defined as the earlier of the TDR being placed on non-accrual status or reaching 90 days past due with respect to principal and/or interest payments within twelve months of the TDR designation) have continued to remain at low levels. 

Capital Resources 

Synovus and Synovus Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by our primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve. Synovus and Synovus Bank measure capital adequacy using the standardized approach under Basel III. At September 30, 2022, Synovus and Synovus Bank's capital levels remained strong and exceeded well-capitalized requirements currently in effect. The following table presents certain ratios used to measure Synovus and Synovus Bank's capitalization. 

Table 11 - Capital Ratios (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 CET1 capital Synovus Financial Corp. $ 4,769,179 &#160; $ 4,388,618 Synovus Bank 5,299,129 &#160; 4,998,698 Tier 1 risk-based capital Synovus Financial Corp. 5,306,324 &#160; 4,925,763 Synovus Bank 5,299,129 &#160; 4,998,698 Total risk-based capital Synovus Financial Corp. 6,237,082 &#160; 5,827,196 Synovus Bank 5,909,788 &#160; 5,587,757 CET1 capital ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 9.52 &#160; % 9.50 % Synovus Bank 10.59 &#160; 10.83 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 10.59 &#160; 10.66 Synovus Bank 10.59 &#160; 10.83 Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 12.45 &#160; 12.61 Synovus Bank 11.81 &#160; 12.11 Leverage ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 9.04 &#160; 8.72 Synovus Bank 9.04 &#160; 8.86 

At September 30, 2022, Synovus' CET1 ratio of 9.52% improved 2 bps compared to December 31, 2021, driven by strong capital generation from earnings mostly offset by significant growth in risk-weighted assets, largely from loan growth, and return of capital primarily through common stock shareholder dividends. Our focus remains on prioritizing capital deployment toward our core growth opportunities. The slower pace of loan growth expected in the fourth quarter of 2022 will likely result in a year-end 2022 CET1 ratio within our 9.50% to 9.75% guidance range. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 - Regulatory Capital" to the consolidated financial statements of Synovus' 2021 Form 10-K. Management reviews the Company's capital position on an on-going basis and believes, based on internal capital analyses and earnings projections, that Synovus is well positioned to meet relevant regulatory capital standards. 

On January 20, 2022, Synovus announced that its Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $300 million in 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, Synovus repurchased a total of $13.0 million, or 281 thousand shares of its common stock, at an average price of $46.17 per share. Based on our current forecast for loan growth and given the uncertain economic environment, we expect to retain the majority of capital generated through earnings to support core balance sheet growth through the remainder of 2022. 

On August 26, 2020, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule (following an interim final rule issued on March 27, 2020) that allowed electing banking organizations that adopted CECL during 2020 to mitigate the estimated effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in transition period. Synovus adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 and the September 30, 2022 regulatory capital ratios reflect Synovus' election of the five-year transition provision. At September 30, 2022, $43.7 million, or a cumulative 9 bps benefit to CET1, was deferred. 

Dividends 

Synovus has historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of its common stock. Management and the Board of Directors closely monitor current and projected capital levels, liquidity (including dividends from subsidiaries), financial markets and other economic trends, as well as regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends. 

Synovus' ability to pay dividends on its common stock and preferred stock is primarily dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from its bank and non-banking subsidiaries, which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities. 

Synovus declared common stock dividends of $148.3 million, or $1.02 per common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to $145.8 million, or $0.99 per common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. In addition, Synovus declared dividends on its preferred stock of $24.9 million during both the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers and creditors, to support asset growth, and to otherwise sustain operations of Synovus and its subsidiaries, at a reasonable cost, on a timely basis, and without adverse consequences. ALCO monitors Synovus' economic, competitive, and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk. 

In accordance with Synovus policies and regulatory guidance, ALCO evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the Company&#8217;s liquidity profile. Synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors, borrowers, and creditors on a timely basis. Liquidity is generated through various sources, including, but not limited to, maturities and repayments of loans by clients, maturities and sales of investment securities, and growth in core and wholesale deposits. 

Synovus Bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Synovus Bank accesses these funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of funding and liquidity. Synovus Bank also has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the FHLB system and through the Federal Reserve discount window. At September 30, 2022, based on currently pledged collateral, Synovus Bank had access to FHLB funding of $1.88 billion, subject to FHLB credit policies. Management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage client deposit withdrawals, loan requests, and other funding demands. 

In addition to bank level liquidity management, Synovus must manage liquidity at the Parent Company level for various operating needs, including the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, share repurchases, payment of general corporate expense, and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries. The primary source of liquidity for Synovus consists of dividends from Synovus Bank, which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the GA DBF and the Federal Reserve Bank. Synovus' ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank's future profits, asset quality, liquidity, and overall condition. In addition, both the GA DBF and Federal Reserve Bank may require approval to pay dividends, based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations. 

Synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above, including existing liquid funds on hand, are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs. However, if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate, regulatory capital requirements for Synovus or Synovus Bank were to increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise, or Synovus were to believe it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels, then Synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources. See "Part I &#8211; Item 1A. Risk Factors - Changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity and financial results " of Synovus' 2021 Form 10-K. Furthermore, Synovus may, from time to time, take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance its existing debt, redeem its preferred stock, or strengthen its liquidity or capital position. 

Earning Assets and Sources of Funds 

Average total assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $2.31 billion, or 4%, as compared to the first nine months of 2021. Average earning assets increased $2.99 billion, or 6%, in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The increase in average earning assets primarily resulted from a $2.01 billion, or 22%, increase in average investment securities available for sale and a $2.50 billion, or 7%, increase in average total loans, net of unearned income, which included a decrease of $1.69 billion in PPP loans. The increase in average loans was primarily attributable to growth in commercial production and line utilization in addition to a deceleration in pay-off activity. These increases were partially offset by a $1.65 billion, or 59%, decrease in average interest-bearing funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $657.6 million, or 2%, for the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities largely resulted from a $617.8 million, or 7%, increase in average interest-bearing demand deposits, a $397.7 million increase in short-term borrowings, and $309.0 million increase in long-term debt, partially offset by a $1.09 billion, or 29%, decrease in average time deposits, largely as a result of rate-driven outflows and normal client liquidity deployment. Average non-interest-bearing deposits increased $1.90 billion, or 13%, for the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 as these deposits continue to be a meaningful component of our funding strategy and have helped manage total funding costs in the rising rate environment. 

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $1.30 billion, up $154.9 million, or 14%, compared to the same period in 2021, including $12.2 million in PPP fees during 2022 and $66.5 million in 2021. Net interest margin was up 22 bps over the comparable nine - month period to 3.24%, due primarily to interest rate increases and disciplined deposit pricing, partially offset by funding mix and a $54.3 million decline in PPP fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the yield on earning assets was 3.55%, an increase of 28 bps compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021, while the effective cost of funds increased 6 bps to 0.31%. Compared to the same period in 2021, the yield on loans increased 14 bps, due primarily to interest rate increases, while the yield on investment securities increased 37 bps, primarily due to higher reinvestment yield and deceleration in prepayment activity compared to the prior year. 

On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up $52.5 million, or 12%, driven by loan growth and higher rates. Net interest margin for the third quarter was 3.49%, which was up 27 bps compared to the second quarter of 2022, aided by higher loan yields from increased interest rates partially offset by higher deposit and wholesale funding costs. The third quarter of 2022 included $1.6 million recognized for associated PPP fees versus $3.7 million in the second quarter of 2022 and average PPP loan balances of $62.6 million versus $147.9 million in the second quarter of 2022. For the third quarter of 2022, the yield on earning assets increased 58 bps, while the effective cost of funds increased 31 bps compared to the second quarter of 2022. The pace of future net interest income growth will be impacted by loan growth, funding mix, timing of deposit repricing, and interest rate policy. We expect net interest income to be driven primarily by balance sheet expansion and fixed-rate repricing as this rate hiking cycle passes. 

Net Interest Income and Rate/Volume Analysis 

The following tables set forth the major components of net interest income and the related annualized yields and rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, as well as the variances between the periods caused by changes in interest rates versus changes in volume.

Market Risk Analysis 

Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Synovus is potentially exposed. Synovus measures its sensitivity to changes in market interest rates through the use of a simulation model, which incorporates all of Synovus&#8217; earning assets and liabilities. These simulations are used to determine a baseline net interest income projection and the sensitivity of the income profile based on changes in interest rates. These simulations incorporate assumptions and factors, including, but not limited to, changes in market rates, in the size or composition of the balance sheet, and in repricing characteristics as well as client behaviors. This process is reviewed and updated on an on-going basis in a manner consistent with Synovus&#8217; ALCO governance framework. 

Synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income forecast assuming a relatively flat interest rate environment, with the federal funds rate at the Federal Reserve&#8217;s targeted range of 3.00% to 3.25% as of September 30, 2022 and the prime rate of 6.25% as of September 30, 2022. Synovus has modeled the impact of an immediate increase in market interest rates across the yield curve of 100 and 200 bps to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next twelve months. Synovus' current rate risk position is considered asset-sensitive and would be expected to benefit net interest income in a rising interest rate environment. The following table represents the estimated sensitivity of net interest income at September 30, 2022, with comparable information for December 31, 2021. 

Table 14 - Twelve Month Net Interest Income Sensitivity Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income as Compared to Unchanged Rates (for the next twelve months) Change in Interest Rates (in bps) September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 +200 8.9% 14.5% +100 4.3% 6.5% 

The net interest income simulation model is the primary tool utilized to evaluate potential interest rate risks over a shorter-term time horizon. Synovus also evaluates potential longer-term interest rate risk through modeling and evaluation of the sensitivity of the Company's EVE. The EVE measurement process estimates the net fair value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet financial instruments under various interest rate scenarios. Management uses EVE sensitivity analyses as an additional means of measuring interest rate risk and incorporates this form of analysis within its governance and limits framework. 

LIBOR Transition 

On March 5, 2021, the FCA confirmed that all LIBOR settings would either cease to be provided by any administrator or would no longer be representative immediately after June 30, 2023, for all remaining US dollar settings. 

The ARRC proposed SOFR as its preferred rate alternative to LIBOR and proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR. Organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. As noted within "Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors" of Synovus' 2021 Form 10-K, Synovus holds instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR, which include floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and hedges, and other financial instruments. Synovus has established a cross-functional LIBOR transition working group with representation from all business lines, support and control functions, and legal counsel that has 1) assessed the Company's current exposure to LIBOR indexed instruments and the data, systems, and processes that were impacted and have been changed as a result; 2) established a detailed implementation plan; 3) formulated communications and learning activities to support clients and colleagues; and 4) developed a formal governance structure for the transition. For the last several years, loan agreement provisions for new and renewed loans included LIBOR fallback language to ensure transition from LIBOR when such transition occurs. All direct exposures resulting from existing financial contracts that mature after 2021 have been inventoried and are monitored on an ongoing basis. The Company discontinued the use of LIBOR as of December 31, 2021, with limited exceptions as permitted by regulatory guidance or internal policies. Synovus has expanded its product offerings and currently offers multiple alternative reference rates to clients including SOFR, BSBY, and prime indices. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had approximately $12 billion in loans tied to LIBOR that mature after June 30, 2023. Remediation activities are underway to modify or transition existing exposures to the applicable Federal Reserve Board selected replacement rate or to convert the rate under existing fallback language, including the use of the Adjustable Interest (LIBOR) Act, enacted in March 2022, and other relevant legislation. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of Synovus are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as &#8220;critical accounting policies,&#8221; consisting of those related to the allowance for credit losses and income taxes. In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, Synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management's practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors' Audit Committee on a periodic basis, including the development, selection, implementation, and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on Synovus&#8217; unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. Synovus&#8217; financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies. All accounting policies described in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Synovus' 2021 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance. There have been no significant changes to the accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions, or the judgments affecting the application of these estimates and assumptions from those disclosed in Synovus' 2021 Form 10-K. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The measures entitled adjusted non-interest revenue, adjusted non-interest expense, adjusted revenue (excluding PPP revenue), adjusted pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) (excluding PPP revenue), adjusted tangible efficiency ratio, adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted net income per common share, diluted, adjusted return on average assets, adjusted return on average common equity, return on average tangible common equity, adjusted return on average tangible common equity, and tangible common equity ratio are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The most comparable GAAP measures to these measures are total non-interest revenue, total non-interest expense, total TE revenue, pre-provision net revenue, efficiency ratio-TE, net income available to common shareholders, net income per common share, diluted, return on average assets, return on average common equity, and the ratio of total shareholders' equity to total assets, respectively. 

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about Synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating Synovus&#8217; operating results, financial strength, the performance of its business, and the strength of its capital position. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors, and since they are not required to be uniformly applied, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies. Adjusted revenue (excluding PPP revenue) and adjusted non-interest revenue are measures used by management to evaluate total TE revenue and non-interest revenue exclusive of items such as PPP revenue, net investment securities gains (losses), and fair value adjustments on non-qualified deferred compensation. Adjusted pre-provision net revenue (excluding PPP revenue) is used by management to evaluate PPNR exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and that impact period-to-period comparisons including PPP revenue. Adjusted non-interest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted net income per common share, diluted, adjusted return on average assets, and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. Return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity is a measure used by management to compare Synovus' performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization, thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently.
