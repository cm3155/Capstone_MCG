In this Report, the words &#8220;Synovus,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Synovus Financial Corp. together with Synovus Bank and Synovus' other wholly-owned subsidiaries, except where the context requires otherwise.

Economic Environment and Recent Events 

While concerns regarding geopolitical pressures, the U.S. political situation, and changes in monetary policy have not abated, the Federal Reserve made its first foray into interest rate reduction with a 50 bps cut in September of 2024, easing monetary policy for the first time in four years. This resulted from continued evidence of inflation moving closer to the Fed&#8217;s 2% target and a desire to stave off any potential upswing in unemployment. Though predictions on interest rate actions have gone back and forth over the course of the year, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s own projections as of the end of October 2024 show an additional 50 bps of rate cuts for the remainder of the year, possibly distributed as two 25 bps rate actions taken at each of the November and December FOMC policy meetings as the Fed continues to monitor relevant economic data that will drive decision making. 

Geopolitical tensions have been exacerbated by escalations in the Middle East between Israel and Iran, a Russian war with Ukraine which is in its third year, and increasingly inflammatory trade rhetoric from the U.S. and China in the months leading up to the U.S. election in November. The election itself carries specific risks and uncertainties as any change in administration could impact economic, regulatory, and fiscal policy by varying degrees. 

U.S. fiscal policy has been expansionary in recent years, leaving a federal deficit which will most likely continue to grow regardless of which candidate wins the election. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in August 2022, raised federal revenue by imposing an alternative corporate minimum tax if certain thresholds are met and a non-deductible excise tax on corporate share repurchases. 

The bank failures in March and May of 2023 and the subsequent response by both the banking industry and the Federal Reserve served to mitigate the risks of such failures becoming more systemic. However, the residual impacts on the banking industry and the broader economic environment remain and have generally presented a more challenging outlook for the banking industry and for Synovus. These bank failures resulted in FDIC special assessment expenses, increased regulatory scrutiny, expectations for future regulatory changes, and continued pressure on deposits and liquidity. 

Despite the headwinds discussed above, we believe our presence in strong Southeastern U.S. growth markets positions Synovus to execute on our 2024 updated fundamental guidance outlined below by making prudent decisions around business mix, balance sheet optimization, and operating expenses, all of which will support enhanced financial performance and a return to growth as we proceed beyond 2024. 

Executive Summary 

Net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $169.6 million, or $1.18 per diluted common share, compared to $87.4 million, or $0.60 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2023. Net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $260.7 million, or $1.79 per diluted common share, compared to $447.1 million, or $3.05 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The year-to-date year-over-year changes were primarily impacted by losses from sales of AFS investment securities totaling $256.7 million in connection with the strategic repositioning of the investment securities portfolio in the second quarter of 2024 and lower net interest income from continued increases in funding costs and negative deposit remixing. Provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $103.8 million compared to $143.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with the decrease driven by improved performance, including a decrease in net charge-offs. 

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.29 billion, down $84.9 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest margin was down 9 bps over the comparable nine-month period in 2023 to 3.16%, impacted by negative deposit remixing and pricing lags within the deposit portfolio. Net interest margin was up 2 bps on a linked quarter basis. The third quarter 2024 included a full quarter impact of the investment securities repositioning in May 2024 and a modest improvement in asset yields, which helped more than offset deposit mix shifts that drove deposit costs to increase over the previous quarter. See "Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 - Investment Securities" in this Report for more information on the securities repositioning. 

Non-interest revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $124.0 million, up $16.8 million, or 16%, compared to the third quarter of 2023, mostly due to higher commercial sponsorship income (primarily within other non-interest revenue), capital markets income, and analysis fees. Non-interest revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $114.0 million, down $238.5 million, or 68%, compared to the same period in 2023, and was impacted by losses from sales of AFS investment securities totaling $256.7 million in the second quarter of 2024 and the prior year $13.1 million one-time benefit from the recovery of a non-performing asset related to the regulatory approval of our Qualpay investment. 

Non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $313.7 million, down $39.8 million, or 11%, and year-to-date was $938.2 million, a decrease of $44.3 million, or 5% compared to the same periods in 2023, due in part to $31.0 million and $50.1 million in losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, related to the strategic sales of medical 

office building loans and third-party consumer loans that closed in the third quarter of 2023. In addition, restructuring charges of $18.4 million were recorded in the third quarter of 2023 for one-time termination benefits associated with a voluntary early retirement program offered to certain qualified employees. 

At September 30, 2024, loans, net of deferred fees and costs, of $43.12 billion, decreased $283.8 million from December 31, 2023. C&#38;I loans increased slightly, impacted by growth in key strategic business lines partially offset by continued focus on strategically reducing non-relationship loans and increased paydowns. CRE loans declined primarily due to increased transactions from client property sales and refinancings partially offset by relatively stable loan production. The decrease in consumer loans resulted primarily from the continued strategic runoff of the third-party lending portfolio in addition to a decline in mortgage loans. 

Credit metrics at September 30, 2024 included both NPAs and NPLs at 73 bps, and total past due loans at 23 bps as a percentage of total loans. Net charge-offs were $27.1 million, or 25 bps annualized, and $105.9 million, or 33 bps annualized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The ACL at September 30, 2024 totaled $534.5 million, a decrease of $2.1 million from December 31, 2023, and the ACL to loans coverage ratio at September 30, 2024 of 1.24% was unchanged compared to December 31, 2023. 

Total period-end deposits at September 30, 2024 decreased $545.4 million compared to December 31, 2023, as a $937.6 million decline in brokered deposits, resulting from continued proactive management of our balance sheet position, was somewhat offset by a $392.1 million increase in core deposits. The growth in core deposits was primarily due to continued client demand for time deposits, partially offset by a decline in non-interest-bearing demand deposits primarily driven by commercial client deployment of excess funds. Additionally, growth in money market and interest-bearing demand accounts thus far in 2024 has contributed to the increase in core deposits compared to December 31, 2023. Total average deposit costs of 2.72% in the third quarter of 2024, increased 4 bps and 41 bps, from the prior quarter and prior year comparable periods, respectively. 

At September 30, 2024, Synovus' CET1 ratio of 10.64% improved 42 bps and 51 bps compared to December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively, as our organic earnings, along with the completion of our risk-weighted assets optimization effort earlier in 2024, supported capital accretion that more than offset share repurchases and the strategic repositioning of the investment securities portfolio during the second quarter of 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Synovus repurchased 5.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of $40.66 per share via open market transactions. 

More detail on Synovus' financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 may be found in subsequent sections of "Item 2. &#8211; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Report. See also "Part 1 &#8211; Item 1A. &#8211; Risk Factors" of Synovus' 2023 Form 10-K.

Changes in Financial Condition 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total assets decreased $219.9 million compared to December 31, 2023 to $59.59 billion. Investment securities totaled $10.18 billion and increased $388.0 million from December 31, 2023. During the second quarter of 2024, Synovus repositioned the AFS securities portfolio by selling lower coupon, lower yielding mortgage-backed securities and purchasing higher yielding AFS securities. Additionally, on April 1, 2024, Synovus transferred $2.72 billion in fair value of investment securities from AFS to HTM, which reduced our exposure to potential volatility associated with investment security market price fluctuations. At the time of transfer, $708.5 million of pre-tax unrealized losses were retained in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized over the remaining life of the securities. See "Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies and Note 2 - Investment Securities" in this Report for more information on the securities transfer and repositioning. 

Loans, net of deferred fees and costs, decreased $283.8 million compared to December 31, 2023. C&#38;I loans increased slightly, impacted by growth in key strategic business lines partially offset by continued focus on strategically reducing non-relationship loans and increased paydowns. CRE loans declined primarily due to increased transactions from client property sales and refinancings partially offset by relatively stable loan production. The decrease in consumer loans resulted primarily from the continued strategic runoff of the third-party lending portfolio in addition to a decline in mortgage loans, largely due to lower production impacted by continued elevated mortgage interest rates that have begun to moderate. 

Deposits decreased $545.4 million compared to December 31, 2023, as a $937.6 million decline in brokered deposits, resulting from continued proactive management of our balance sheet position, was somewhat offset by a $392.1 million increase in core deposits. The loan to deposit ratio was 85.9% at September 30, 2024 as compared to 85.5% at December 31, 2023. 

Total Synovus Financial Corp. shareholders' equity at September 30, 2024 increased $236.0 million compared to December 31, 2023, driven by a reduction in after-tax net unrealized losses on investment securities AFS of $781.2 million, which was somewhat offset by $506.7 million in after-tax net unrealized losses on investment securities HTM that were transferred from investment securities AFS. Retained earnings increased and included net income attributable to Synovus Financial Corp. of $292.0 million, partially offset by common and preferred stock dividends of $164.4 million and $31.3 million, respectively. In addition, there was a decrease of $222.6 million for common stock repurchases.

(1) Includes senior housing loans of $3.10 billion, $3.28 billion, and $3.46 billion at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively, which are primarily classified as owner-occupied in accordance with our underwriting process. 

At September 30, 2024, loans, net of deferred fees and costs of $43.12 billion, decreased $283.8 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2023. C&#38;I loans increased slightly, impacted by growth in key strategic business lines partially offset by continued focus on strategically reducing non-relationship loans and increased paydowns. CRE loans declined primarily due to 

increased transactions from client property sales and refinancings partially offset by relatively stable loan production. The decrease in consumer loans resulted primarily from the continued strategic runoff of the third-party lending portfolio in addition to a decline in mortgage loans, largely due to lower production impacted by continued elevated mortgage interest rates that have begun to moderate. 

C&#38;I loans remain the largest component of our loan portfolio, representing 52.6% of total loans, while CRE and consumer loans represent 28.2% and 19.2%, respectively. Our portfolio composition is guided by our strategic growth plan, in conjunction with a comprehensive concentration management policy which sets limits for C&#38;I, CRE, and consumer loan levels as well as sub-categories therein. 

Commercial Loans 

Total commercial loans (which are comprised of C&#38;I and CRE loans) at September 30, 2024 were $34.84 billion, or 80.8% of the total loan portfolio, compared to $34.92 billion, or 80.4%, at December 31, 2023. 

Synovus actively manages and evaluates credit risk associated with its commercial loans through robust underwriting policies and routine loan monitoring in order to identify and mitigate any weakness as early as possible. Synovus&#8217; management, along with its Chief Credit Officer and Credit Risk Committee, continually monitors and evaluates commercial concentrations by property class, industry, and relative to regulatory capital to remain in line with Board-established limits and adapt to changing industry conditions. As part of its risk management efforts, Synovus monitors its commercial loan portfolio on an ongoing basis to assess credit risks, identify emerging risks, and adjust its lending limits taking into account, among other things, (1) the size, complexity, and level of risk of loans and individual borrowers, (2) changes in the level of credit risk at both the borrower and portfolio level, (3) concentrations of credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and geographies in its loan portfolio, (4) loan structure, collateral location and quality, and project progress, and (5) economic forecasts and industry outlook. 

Synovus has established recommended credit exposure limits for large commercial lending relationships based on Synovus' internal risk ratings for an individual borrower at the time the lending commitment is approved, with the final exposure limit being determined by the appropriate credit approval committee. Commercial credits are subject to review according to credit risk management monitoring practices as outlined in Synovus' loan policy, as well as a sampling process performed by Synovus Credit Review to ensure uniform application of policies and procedures and to validate risk rating accuracy. Synovus prepares targeted stress tests on a routine basis for its commercial loans. This testing is completed in addition to sensitivity testing completed at the initial extension of credit. 

Commercial and Industrial Loans 

The C&#38;I loan portfolio represents the largest category of Synovus' loan portfolio and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a diverse set of industries as well as certain specialized lending verticals. The following table shows the composition of the C&#38;I loan portfolio aggregated by NAICS code. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 95.2% and 94.8%, respectively, of Synovus' C&#38;I loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventory, and other types of collateral. C&#38;I loans at September 30, 2024 grew $65.5 million from December 31, 2023, and resulted primarily from growth in key business lines, led by middle market, specialty finance, and CIB, partially offset by continued strategic decline from non-relationship loans and increased paydowns.

(2) Comprised of NAICS industries that are less than 1% of total C&#38;I loans at September 30, 2024. 

At September 30, 2024, $14.56 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 33.8% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing commercial, financial and agricultural business activities. The primary source of repayment on these loans is revenue generated from products or services offered by the business or organization. The secondary source of repayment is the collateral, which consists primarily of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, time deposits, cash surrender value of life insurance, and other business assets. 

At September 30, 2024, $8.10 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 18.8% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing owner-occupied properties. The financing of owner-occupied facilities is considered a C&#38;I loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral such as senior housing facilities. This treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The secondary source of repayment on these loans is the underlying real estate. These loans are predominantly secured by owner-occupied and other real estate and, to a lesser extent, other types of collateral. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

CRE loans consist primarily of income-producing investment properties loans. Additionally, CRE loans include 1-4 family properties loans as well as land and development loans. 

Total CRE loans of $12.18 billion decreased $139.3 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2023, primarily due to elevated levels of transaction activity from client property sales and refinancings partially offset by relatively stable loan production. 

Investment properties loans consist of construction and mortgage loans for income-producing properties and are primarily made to finance multi-family properties, hotels, office buildings, shopping centers, warehouses and other commercial development properties. Total investment properties loans as of September 30, 2024 were $11.35 billion, or 93.2% of the CRE loan portfolio, and decreased $16.8 million from December 31, 2023. 

The following table shows the principal categories of the investment properties loan portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

(2) LTV calculated by dividing the respective September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 commitment amount and senior lien by most recent appraisal (typically at origination). 

1-4 Family Properties Loans 

1-4 family properties loans include construction loans to home builders and commercial mortgage loans related to 1-4 family rental properties and are almost always secured by the underlying property being financed by such loans. These properties are primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. At September 30, 2024, 1-4 family properties loans totaled $528.1 million, or 4.3% of the CRE loan portfolio, and decreased $70.4 million from December 31, 2023. 

Land and Development Loans 

Land and development loans include commercial and residential development as well as land acquisition loans and are secured by land held for future development, typically in excess of one year. Properties securing these loans are substantially within markets served by Synovus, and loan terms generally include personal guarantees from the principals. Loans in this portfolio are underwritten based on the LTV of the collateral and the capacity of the guarantor(s). Land and development loans of $302.8 million at September 30, 2024 decreased $52.1 million from December 31, 2023. 

Consumer Loans 

The consumer loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through Synovus' banking network, including first and second residential mortgages, home equity and consumer credit card loans, as well as both secured and unsecured loans from third-party lending. As of September 30, 2024, weighted-average FICO scores within the residential real estate portfolio based on committed balances were 783 for consumer mortgages and 796 for home equity, consistent with year-end 2023 scores. 

Consumer loans at September 30, 2024 of $8.28 billion decreased $210.0 million, or 2%, compared to December 31, 2023. Mortgage loans decreased $88.3 million from December 31, 2023 largely due to lower production impacted by continued elevated mortgage interest rates that have begun to moderate. Other consumer loans decreased $110.9 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to continued strategic runoff of the third-party lending portfolio. 

Deposits 

Deposits provide the most significant funding source for interest earning assets. The following table shows the composition of period-end deposits as of the dates indicated. See Table 11 - Quarter-to-Date Net Interest Income and Rate/Volume Analysis

(2) Excluding any public funds or brokered deposits. 

(3) Core deposits exclude brokered deposits. 

Total period-end deposits at September 30, 2024 decreased $545.4 million compared to December 31, 2023 as a $937.6 million decline in brokered deposits, resulting from continued proactive management of our balance sheet position, was somewhat offset by a $392.1 million increase in core deposits. The growth in core deposits was primarily due to continued client demand for time deposits, partially offset by a decline in non-interest-bearing demand deposits primarily driven by commercial client deployment of excess funds. Additionally, growth in money market and interest-bearing demand accounts thus far in 2024 has contributed to the increase in core deposits compared to December 31, 2023. 

Total average deposit costs of 2.72% in the third quarter of 2024 increased 4 bps and 41 bps, from the prior quarter and prior year comparable periods, respectively. Total average deposit costs compared to the prior year comparable period were higher primarily due to the aforementioned continued client demand for time deposits along with remixing of non-interest-bearing demand deposits. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $24.71 billion and $23.77 billion, respectively, of our deposit portfolio was uninsured. The uninsured amounts are estimated based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory reporting requirements. At September 30, 2024, approximately 82% of our deposits are either insured (51%), collateralized (14%), or could be insured by switching to our insured cash sweep program, which has existing capacity (17%).

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 

Non-interest revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $124.0 million, up $16.8 million, or 16%, compared to the third quarter of 2023, mostly due to higher commercial sponsorship income (primarily within other non-interest revenue), capital markets income, and analysis fees. Non-interest revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $114.0 million, down $238.5 million, or 68%, compared to the same period in 2023, and was impacted by losses from sales of AFS investment securities totaling $256.7 million in connection with the strategic repositioning of the investment securities portfolio in the second quarter of 2024 and the prior year $13.1 million one-time benefit from the recovery of a non-performing asset related to the regulatory approval of our Qualpay investment. 

Service charges on deposit accounts, consisting of account analysis fees, NSF fees, and all other service charges increased slightly over the prior year comparable periods. The largest category of service charges, account analysis fees, were up $2.1 million, or 20%, compared to the third quarter of 2023 and increased $4.6 million, or 14% on a comparable year-to-date basis largely due to a reduction in waivers that began in the second quarter of 2024. NSF/overdraft fees were up $0.2 million, or 4%, and down $3.0 million, or 17%, on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis, respectively. The year-to-date decline was primarily due to the impact of NSF/overdraft fee program changes implemented in the third quarter of 2023. All other service charges on deposit accounts, which consist primarily of monthly fees on consumer demand deposits and small business accounts, were flat quarter over quarter and were down $955 thousand, or 5%, in the comparable year-to-date period, primarily due to checking account product and fee changes implemented in the third quarter of 2023. 

Fiduciary and asset management fees are derived from providing estate administration, personal trust, corporate trust, corporate bond, investment management, financial planning, and family office services. Fiduciary and asset management fees were down for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by a decline in asset management income impacted by the sale of GLOBALT on September 30, 2023, partially offset by higher trust fees, including increased investment advisor fees. 

Card fees consist primarily of credit card interchange fees, debit card interchange fees, and merchant revenue. Card fees are reported net of certain associated expense items, including client loyalty program expenses and network expenses. Merchant 

revenue relates to the fees that are charged to merchant clients based on a percentage of their credit or debit card transaction volume amounts. Card fees for the third quarter of 2024 were down slightly compared to the third quarter of 2023, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, card fees were up 11% on a comparable year-to-date basis, primarily due to $5.3 million higher merchant fees related to a full year of our Qualpay investment. 

Brokerage revenue consists primarily of brokerage commissions as well as advisory fees earned from the management of client assets. Brokerage revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 3% and 6%, respectively, over the prior year comparable periods, with the decline mainly attributable to repurchase volume associated with a single municipal client, partially offset by higher market-driven advisory fees and increased rate-driven annuities revenue. 

Mortgage banking income, consisting of net gains on loan origination/sales activities, increased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This growth can be attributed to a more favorable interest rate environment and a stabilizing pipeline, partially offset by lower production revenue. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year-to-date period was primarily driven by reduced production revenue. Secondary market production for the third quarter of 2024 declined 20% compared to the third quarter of 2023, while year-to-date, production decreased 12% compared to the same period in 2023. 

Capital markets income primarily includes fee income from client derivative transactions, debt capital market transactions, foreign exchange, gains (losses) from sales of SBA loans, as well as other miscellaneous income from capital market transactions. The increase in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to $1.7 million higher loan syndication arranger fees, $869 thousand higher debt capital market transaction fees, a $586 thousand increase in foreign exchange sales income, and a $318 thousand increase in gains on sales of SBA loans, partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in fees on client derivative transactions. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was largely impacted by $4.5 million lower client derivative transactions and a $1.2 million decrease in LIHTC-related income, somewhat offset by a $3.1 million increase in debt capital market transaction fees and $1.8 million higher foreign exchange sales income. 

The main components of other non-interest revenue are fees for letters of credit and unused lines of credit, safe deposit box fees, access fees for ATM use, other service charges and loan servicing fees, earnings on equity method investments, commercial sponsorship income, including transaction and servicing fees associated with a third-party lending relationship, and other miscellaneous items. The three months ended September 30, 2024 increase compared to the prior year was largely due to $6.9 million higher commercial sponsorship income and a $3.1 million increase in the fair value of non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets (offset in non-interest expense). The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was largely attributable to $22.2 million higher commercial sponsorship income and a $3.0 million increase in the fair value of non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets (offset in non-interest expense). 

Non-interest Expense 

The following table summarizes the components of non-interest expense.

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 

Non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $313.7 million, down $39.8 million, or 11%, and year-to-date was $938.2 million, a decrease of $44.3 million, or 5%, compared to the same periods in 2023, due in part to $31.0 million and $50.1 million in losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, related to the strategic sales of medical office building loans and third-party consumer loans that closed in the third quarter of 2023. In addition, restructuring charges of $18.4 million were recorded in the third quarter of 2023 for one-time termination benefits associated with a voluntary early retirement program offered to certain qualified employees. 

Salaries and other personnel expense increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to higher incentive compensation due to outperformance, a $3.1 million unfavorable change in the fair value of non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets (offset in non-interest revenue), and unfavorable impact from deferred loan origination costs driven by the overall mix of loan production, partially offset by lower employee insurance from decreased claims in 2024 and headcount reductions. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 increase was largely the result of higher incentive compensation due to outperformance, unfavorable impact from deferred loan origination costs driven by lower loan production, and a $3.0 million unfavorable change in the fair value of non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets (offset in non-interest revenue), partially offset by lower employee insurance from decreased claims in 2024, reduced temporary help expense, and headcount reductions. Total headcount of 4,806 was down by 191, or 4%, compared to September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of the voluntary early retirement program offered to certain qualified employees in 2023, in addition to strategic reductions in areas primarily impacted by production volume declines. 

Net occupancy, equipment, and software expense increased compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to ongoing investments in technology in addition to increased property expense. 

Third-party processing and other services expense includes all third-party core operating system and processing charges as well as third-party loan servicing charges. Third-party processing expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the same period in 2023 largely due to lower servicing fees associated with decreased third-party consumer loans. 

Professional fees were up for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to $7.3 million higher legal fees primarily associated with the process of resolving certain loan relationships, partially offset by $2.1 million lower consulting fees compared to 2023. 

FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 largely due to a lower base assessment rate and a $1.7 million reversal related to the FDIC special assessment based on the invoice received from the FDIC in the third quarter of 2024. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 increase was driven by a net increase of $7.2 million to the accrual related to updated estimates of the FDIC special assessment partially offset by a slightly lower base assessment rate. 

Amortization of intangibles increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to Synovus' acquisition of Qualpay in the second quarter of 2023. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, restructuring charges (reversals) primarily consisted of $4.3 million of asset impairment charges related to corporate offices/branches and $878 thousand of net severance expense somewhat offset by $3.8 million in gains on sales of properties, while the restructuring charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included $5.9 million in asset impairment/lease termination and common area maintenance charges related to corporate offices/branches as well as $568 thousand in net severance expense partially offset by $4.4 million in gains on sales of properties. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, restructuring charges (reversals) primarily consisted of $18.4 million in one-time termination benefits associated with a voluntary early retirement program offered to certain qualified employees and $857 thousand in gains on sale of branches previously closed. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 included the aforementioned charges related to the voluntary early retirement program in addition to $1.5 million of additional severance that was unrelated to the amount recorded for the voluntary early retirement program, partially offset by $4.1 million in gains on the sale of branches previously closed. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Synovus recorded a valuation adjustment of $8.7 million to the Visa derivative associated with an indemnification agreement following Visa's announcement to fund to its litigation escrow account. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Synovus recorded valuation adjustments of $900 thousand and $3.9 million, respectively, to the Visa derivative associated with an indemnification agreement following Visa's announcement to fund to its litigation escrow account. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Synovus recorded losses of $31.0 million and $50.1 million, respectively, related to the strategic sales of medical office building loans and third-party consumer loans that closed in the third quarter of 2023. 

Other operating expense includes advertising, travel, insurance, network and communication, other taxes, subscriptions and dues, other loan and ORE expense, postage and freight, training, business development, supplies, donations, and other miscellaneous expense. Other operating expense was down from the comparable periods in 2023 largely due to efforts to reduce client fraud and other operational losses as well as other prudent expense management efforts. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense was $46.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $27.7 million of tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing effective tax rates of 20.6% and 22.3%, respectively. Income tax expense was $76.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income tax expense of $133.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing effective tax rates of 20.9% and 22.0%, respectively. 

The effective tax rate was lower for both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, due to varying levels of pre-tax income and a change in the timing and mix of discrete tax items recognized in the comparable periods. These discrete items include tax benefits from share-based compensation, the accrual and release of valuation allowances or reserves for uncertain tax positions, and accounting for changes in tax laws, all of which can vary significantly and affect comparability from period to period. 

CREDIT QUALITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 

Credit Quality 

Synovus diligently monitors the quality of its loan portfolio by industry, property type, and geography through a thorough portfolio review process and our analytical risk management tools. Such credit surveillance efforts are part of a broader credit risk management framework which includes Board oversight, as well as management-level committee oversight at varying levels across the portfolio. Governance includes limits across a host of factors, ranging from borrower-specific metrics and concentrations to enterprise-level portfolio concentrations. These measures are further complemented by an enterprise risk appetite framework, which helps ensure an expansive view across a myriad of credit risks within the portfolio. 

At September 30, 2024, credit metrics included both NPAs and NPLs at 73 bps, and total past due loans at 23 bps as a percentage of total loans. Net charge-offs were $27.1 million, or 25 bps annualized, and $105.9 million, or 33 bps annualized, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Two major hurricanes have recently caused devastation to areas within and around the Synovus footprint, with Hurricane Helene impacting parts of the Carolinas, Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee near the end of September 2024 and Hurricane Milton impacting parts of Florida in early October 2024. Following each storm, Synovus deployed its bankers to reach out to clients in affected areas, to assess any impact, and to develop a plan. Preliminary surveillance efforts thus far indicate that Synovus will experience minimal credit losses as a result of the hurricanes. Synovus activated its Loan Payment Deferral Disaster Relief 

Program for both hurricanes, which allows a payment deferral period of 90 days with relief requests available for up to 60 days from the disaster declaration date for impacted borrowers in FEMA-designated areas throughout the Synovus footprint. Through November 1, 2024, approximately $139 million of the total loan portfolio had a completed or pending 90-day payment deferral request. 

The table below includes selected credit quality metrics.

Non-performing Assets 

Total NPAs were $313.4 million at September 30, 2024, a $25.2 million, or 9%, increase from December 31, 2023 primarily due to the designation of a large commercial real estate office relationship as non-performing, partially offset by the resolution of a few non-performing relationships. 

Criticized and Classified Loans 

Our loan ratings are aligned to federal banking regulators' definitions of pass and criticized categories, which include special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. Substandard accruing and non-accruing loans, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as classified. Special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as criticized and classified loans. The following table presents a summary of criticized and classified loans. Criticized and classified loans at September 30, 2024 increased $166.7 million compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to the 

downward migration of several commercial credits.

Provision for (Reversal of) Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses was $23.4 million and $103.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision of $72.6 million and $143.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases compared to the same periods in 2023 were driven by improved performance, including a decrease in net charge-offs. Net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $27.1 million and $105.9 million, respectively, compared to $66.8 million and $111.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The ALL of $485.0 million and the reserve for unfunded commitments of $49.6 million, which is recorded in other liabilities, comprise the total ACL of $534.5 million at September 30, 2024. The ACL decreased $2.1 million compared to the December 31, 2023 ACL of $536.6 million, which consisted of an ALL of $479.4 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments of $57.2 million. When compared to the December 31, 2023 ACL, the September 30, 2024 ACL was slightly lower and characterized by lower net growth and improved performance, as well as increased economic uncertainty. The ACL to loans coverage ratio of 1.24% at September 30, 2024 was unchanged compared to December 31, 2023. 

Capital Resources 

Synovus and Synovus Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by our primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve. Synovus and Synovus Bank measure capital adequacy using the standardized approach under Basel III. Beyond adhering to regulatory capital standards, Synovus also maintains a rigorous capital management and adequacy framework, which includes oversight by both the ALCO and the Board. This effort involves monitoring and managing our capital position in alignment with our Board&#8217;s risk appetite framework and with a Board-approved annual capital plan, with a focus on applicable regulatory capital ratios. Our ALCO serves to provide management level oversight within this framework, which may include establishing target operating ranges for certain capital measures, such as CET1, as a means to provide further clarity over the management of our capital position. 

At September 30, 2024, Synovus and Synovus Bank's capital levels remained strong and exceeded well-capitalized requirements currently in effect. The following table presents certain ratios used to measure Synovus and Synovus Bank's capitalization. 

Table 10 - Capital Ratios (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 CET1 capital Synovus Financial Corp. $ 5,107,668 &#160; $ 5,206,521 Synovus Bank 5,559,883 &#160; 5,559,624 Tier 1 risk-based capital Synovus Financial Corp. 5,644,813 &#160; 5,743,666 Synovus Bank 5,559,883 &#160; 5,559,624 Total risk-based capital Synovus Financial Corp. 6,529,260 &#160; 6,654,224 Synovus Bank 6,269,951 &#160; 6,249,947 CET1 capital ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 10.64 &#160; % 10.22 % Synovus Bank 11.60 &#160; 10.93 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 11.76 &#160; 11.28 Synovus Bank 11.60 &#160; 10.93 Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 13.60 &#160; 13.07 Synovus Bank 13.08 &#160; 12.29 Leverage ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 9.55 &#160; 9.49 Synovus Bank 9.43 &#160; 9.21 

At September 30, 2024, Synovus' CET1 ratio of 10.64% improved 42 bps compared to December 31, 2023, as our organic earnings, along with the completion of our risk-weighted assets optimization effort earlier in 2024, supported capital accretion that more than offset share repurchases and the strategic repositioning of the investment securities portfolio during the second quarter of 2024. We will continue to maintain a disciplined approach to capital management, which acknowledges the uncertain economic environment and ensures sufficient capital for expected client growth. Our focus remains on prioritizing the deployment of our balance sheet and capital position for core client growth; however, we expect to continue to complement that with share repurchases to effectively manage within our capital management framework. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 - Regulatory Capital" to the consolidated financial statements of Synovus' 2023 Form 10-K. Management reviews the Company's capital position on an ongoing basis and believes, based on internal capital analyses and earnings projections, that Synovus is well positioned to meet relevant regulatory capital standards. 

The Company announced on January 18, 2024 that its Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $300 million of common stock and $50 million of preferred stock in 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Synovus repurchased 2.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of $43.58 per share via open market transactions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Synovus repurchased 5.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of $40.66 per share via open market transactions. 

On August 26, 2020, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule that allowed electing banking organizations that adopted CECL during 2020 to mitigate the estimated effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in transition period. Synovus adopted CECL on January 1, 2020, and the September 30, 2024 regulatory capital ratios reflect Synovus' election of the five-year transition provision. At September 30, 2024, $14.6 million, or a cumulative 3 bps benefit to CET1, was deferred. 

Dividends 

Synovus has historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of its common stock. Management and the Board of Directors closely monitor current and projected capital levels, liquidity (including dividends from subsidiaries), financial markets and other economic trends, as well as regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends. 

Synovus' ability to pay dividends on its common stock and preferred stock is primarily dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from its bank and non-banking subsidiaries, which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities. 

Synovus declared common stock dividends of $164.4 million, or $1.14 per common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $166.6 million, or $1.14 per common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, Synovus declared dividends on its preferred stock of $31.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $26.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers, and creditors; to support asset growth; and to otherwise sustain operations of Synovus and its subsidiaries, at a reasonable cost, on a timely basis, and without adverse consequences. ALCO monitors Synovus' economic, competitive, and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk. 

In accordance with Synovus policies and regulatory guidance, ALCO evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the Company&#8217;s liquidity profile. Synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors, borrowers, and creditors on a timely basis. Liquidity is generated through various sources, including, but not limited to, maturities and repayments of loans by clients, maturities and sales of investment securities, and growth in core and wholesale deposits. 

Synovus Bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Synovus Bank accesses funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of funding and liquidity. Synovus Bank also has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the FHLB system and the Federal Reserve. Management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage client deposit withdrawals, loan requests, and other funding demands. 

Total deposits at September 30, 2024 decreased $545.4 million compared to December 31, 2023, with a $937.6 million decline in brokered deposits, resulting from continued proactive management of our balance sheet position, that was somewhat offset by a $392.1 million increase in core deposits. The growth in core deposits was primarily due to continued client demand for time deposits partially offset by a decline in non-interest-bearing demand deposits primarily driven by commercial client deployment of excess funds. Additionally, growth in money market and interest-bearing demand accounts thus far in 2024 contributed to the increase in core deposits compared to December 31, 2023. Synovus continues to proactively manage its liquidity position, which has included the level of brokered deposits, and robust contingent liquidity is maintained across a diverse set of sources which include immediately available funds as well as funds we expect to be available within short notice. Contingent liquidity sources include primary sources such as FHLB borrowing capacity, FRB cash reserves, unencumbered securities, and third-party consumer loans, which includes our decision to sell loans from this portfolio and strategic runoff, while secondary sources consist of the Federal Reserve discount window, Fed Funds lines, and other sources. At September 30, 2024, contingent sources of liquidity totaled approximately $26.6 billion, and based on currently pledged collateral, Synovus Bank had access to FHLB funding of $7.4 billion, subject to FHLB credit policies. 

In addition to bank level liquidity management, Synovus must manage liquidity at the Parent Company level for various operating needs, including the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, payment of general corporate expense, and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries. The primary source of liquidity for Synovus consists of dividends from Synovus Bank, which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the GA DBF and the Federal Reserve Bank. Synovus' ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank's future profits, asset quality, liquidity, and overall condition. In addition, both the GA DBF and Federal Reserve Bank may require approval to pay dividends, based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations. 

Synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above, including existing liquid funds on hand, are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs. However, if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate, regulatory capital requirements for Synovus or Synovus Bank were to increase as a result of directives or otherwise, or Synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels, then Synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources. See "Part I &#8211; Item 1A. Risk Factors - Market and Other General Risk - Recent negative developments affecting the banking industry, and resulting media coverage, have eroded client confidence in the banking system , and Credit and Liquidity Risk - Changes in the 

cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity and financial results , " of Synovus' 2023 Form 10-K. Furthermore, Synovus may, from time to time, take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance, retire, or repurchase its existing debt, redeem or issue its preferred stock, repurchase shares, or strengthen its liquidity or capital position. 

Earning Assets and Sources of Funds 

Average earning assets decreased $1.96 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decline in average earning assets primarily resulted from a decline of $582.6 million in average investment securities (amortized cost basis), a decline of $580.6 million in average total loans, net of unearned income, and a decline of $559.2 million in average other loans held for sale. The lower average investment securities (amortized cost basis) were primarily due to the transfer of investment securities from AFS to HTM on April 1, 2024, which included unrealized losses at the date of transfer that will be amortized over the remaining life of the securities as an adjustment to yield, offsetting the amortization of the discount resulting from the transfer recorded at fair value. The decrease in average total loans, net of unearned income, was largely due to a continued focus on strategically reducing non-relationship loans, increased paydowns, and a decline in third-party consumer loans from continued run-off. The decline in average other loans held for sale was primarily attributable to sales of third-party consumer loans in 2023. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $332.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities largely resulted from increases of $3.35 billion and $1.04 billion in average time deposits and average interest-bearing demand deposits, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of $830.8 million in average money market accounts, a decrease of $551.1 million in average brokered deposits, as well as decreases of $644.5 million and $1.80 billion in average other short-term borrowings and average long-term debt, respectively. The increases in time deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits and decrease in money market accounts were correlated, as fluctuations between these categories have been driven by the rate environment. The decreases to brokered deposits, other short-term borrowings, and long-term debt were largely due to the ongoing management of our liquidity position. Average non-interest-bearing demand deposits decreased $2.03 billion for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to the continued pressures from the rate environment and client deployment of excess funds. 

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.29 billion, down $84.9 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest margin was down 9 bps over the comparable period to 3.16%, impacted by negative deposit remixing and pricing lags within the deposit portfolio. 

On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up $5.7 million, or 1%, and net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was up 2 bps compared to the second quarter of 2024. The third quarter included a full quarter impact of the investment securities repositioning in May and a modest improvement in asset yields. See "Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 - Investment Securities" in this Report for more information on the securities repositioning. This helped more than offset deposit mix shifts that drove deposit costs to increase over the previous quarter. As we look to the fourth quarter of 2024, we project a relatively stable net interest margin. In isolation, the anticipated FOMC easing will serve as a modest headwind to the net interest margin as a result of repricing lead-lag impacts. However, the beneficial impact of fixed-rate asset repricing and hedge maturities in the fourth quarter of 2024 should support the net interest margin.

Market Risk Analysis 

Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Synovus is potentially exposed. Synovus measures the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates through the use of simulation modeling, which incorporates all of Synovus&#8217; earning assets and liabilities. These simulations are used to determine a baseline net interest income projection and the sensitivity of the income profile based on changes in interest rates. These simulations incorporate assumptions and factors, including, but not limited to, changes in market rates, in the size or composition of the balance sheet, and in repricing characteristics as well as client behaviors for both loans and deposits. This includes estimates for deposit repricing characteristics which, for purposes of the sensitivity estimates provided below, relies upon a constant, through-the-cycle total deposit cost beta of approximately 45% when compared to FOMC policy and other short-term rates. The deposit beta assumptions are based on historical observations and future expectations. This process is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis in a manner consistent with Synovus&#8217; ALCO governance framework. 

The Risk Committee of the Board has chartered the ALCO and approved related policies to aid in the management and governance of various risks, including interest rate risk. The ALCO has an established limit framework for interest rate risk, which is monitored on an ongoing basis and is in alignment with the tolerances and limits as established by the Board. Additionally, Synovus&#8217; ERM framework establishes a Board-approved risk appetite statement, which includes certain quantitative measurements for interest rate risk and helps to ensure management operates within the Board&#8217;s established appetite. 

Synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income forecast assuming an interest rate projection that is flat to September 30, 2024 interest rate curves, with the federal funds rate at the Federal Reserve&#8217;s targeted range of 4.75% to 5.00% as of September 30, 2024 and the prime rate of 8.00% as of September 30, 2024. Synovus has modeled the impact of an immediate change in market interest rates across the yield curve of 100 and 200 bps to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next 12 months. As illustrated in the table below, the net interest income sensitivity derived from this simulation suggests that net interest income is projected to increase by 3.1% and 1.6% if interest rates increased by 200 and 100 bps, respectively. Net interest income is projected to decrease by 1.6% and 3.1% if interest rates decreased by 100 and 200 bps, respectively. 

The following table represents the estimated sensitivity of net interest income at September 30, 2024, with comparable information for December 31, 2023. 

Table 13 - Twelve Month Net Interest Income Sensitivity Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income as Compared to Unchanged Rates (for the next 12 months) Change in Interest Rates (in bps) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 +200 3.1% 3.7% +100 1.6 1.9 -100 (1.6) (2.0) -200 (3.1) (4.1) 

While all of the above estimates are reflective of the general interest rate sensitivity of Synovus, local market conditions, the realized growth and remixing of the balance sheet, as well as the broader macroeconomic environment could all have a significant impact on both the sensitivity and realized level of net interest income. Additionally, should there be differences between realized deposit betas for a given level of rates as compared to the Company's estimates for through-the-cycle betas, this may also have a significant impact on our reported sensitivity and the realized level of net interest income. 

The net interest income simulation model is the primary tool utilized to evaluate potential interest rate risks over a shorter-term time horizon. Synovus also evaluates potential longer-term interest rate risk through modeling and evaluation of the sensitivity of the Company's EVE. The EVE measurement process estimates the net fair value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet financial instruments under various interest rate scenarios. Management uses EVE sensitivity analyses as an additional means of measuring interest rate risk and incorporates this form of analysis within its governance and limits framework. 

Synovus is also subject to market risk in certain of its fee income business lines. Financial management services revenue, which include trust, brokerage, and asset management fees, can be affected by risk in the securities markets, primarily the equity securities market. A significant portion of the fees in this unit are determined based upon a percentage of asset values. Weaker securities markets and lower equity values have an adverse impact on the fees generated by these operations. Trading account assets, maintained to facilitate brokerage client activity, are also subject to market risk; however, trading activities are limited and subject to risk policy limits. Additionally, Synovus utilizes various tools to measure and manage price risk in its trading portfolio. 

Mortgage banking income is also subject to market risk. Mortgage loan originations are sensitive to levels of mortgage interest rates and therefore, mortgage banking income can be negatively impacted during periods of rising interest rates as we experienced during the prior year along with volatility in interest rates during the current year. The extension of commitments to clients to fund mortgage loans also subjects Synovus to market risk. This risk is primarily created by the time periods between making the commitment, closing, and delivering the loan. Synovus seeks to minimize its exposure by utilizing various risk management tools, including forward sales commitments and other economic hedges. 

Derivative Instruments for Interest Rate Risk Management 

Synovus utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to various types of structural interest rate risks by executing end-user derivative transactions designated as hedges. Hedging relationships may be designated as either a cash flow hedge, which mitigates risk exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions, or a fair value hedge, which mitigates risk exposure to adverse changes in the fair market value of a fixed rate asset or liability due to changes in market interest rates. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Synovus had $4.60 billion and $5.60 billion, respectively, in notional amounts outstanding of both effective and forward-starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedging instruments to hedge its exposure to contractually specified interest rate risk associated with floating rate loans. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Synovus had $1.68 billion and $2.56 billion, respectively, in notional amounts outstanding of receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedging instruments to hedge its exposure to the change in the fair value due to fluctuations in market interest rates for outstanding fixed-rate long-term debt and fixed-rate interest-bearing deposits. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of Synovus are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as &#8220;critical accounting policies,&#8221; consisting of those related to the allowance for credit losses and income taxes. In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, Synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management's practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors' Audit Committee on a periodic basis, including the development, selection, implementation, and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on Synovus&#8217; unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. Synovus&#8217; financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies. All accounting policies described in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Synovus' 2023 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance. There have been no significant changes to the accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions, or the judgments affecting the application of these estimates and assumptions from those disclosed in Synovus' 2023 Form 10-K. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The measures entitled adjusted non-interest revenue, adjusted non-interest expense, adjusted revenue taxable equivalent (TE), adjusted tangible efficiency ratio, adjusted pre-provision net revenue (PPNR), adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted net income per common share, diluted, adjusted return on average assets, adjusted return on average common equity, return on average tangible common equity, adjusted return on average tangible common equity, and tangible common equity ratio, are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The most comparable GAAP measures to these measures are total non-interest revenue, total non-interest expense, total revenue, efficiency ratio-TE, PPNR, net income (loss) available to common shareholders, net income (loss) per common share, diluted, return on average assets, return on average common equity, and the ratio of total Synovus Financial Corp. shareholders' equity to total assets, respectively. 

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about Synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating Synovus&#8217; operating results, financial strength, the performance of its business, and the strength of its capital position. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors, and since they are not required to be uniformly applied, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies. Adjusted non-interest revenue and adjusted revenue (TE) are measures used by management to evaluate non-interest revenue and total revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains (losses), fair value adjustments on non-qualified deferred compensation, and other items not indicative of ongoing operations that could impact period-to-period comparisons. Adjusted non-interest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are 

measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted net income per common share, diluted, adjusted return on average assets, and adjusted return on average common equity are measures used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. Adjusted PPNR is used by management to evaluate PPNR exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. Return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity are measures used by management to compare Synovus' performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization, thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently. The tangible common equity ratio is used by stakeholders to assess our capital position. The computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below. 

Management does not provide a reconciliation for forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the occurrence and the financial impact of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of Synovus&#8217; control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, Synovus&#8217; management is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.
