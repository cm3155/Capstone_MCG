In this Report, the words &#8220;Synovus,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Synovus Financial Corp. together with Synovus Bank and Synovus' other wholly-owned subsidiaries, except where the context requires otherwise. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain statements made or incorporated by reference in this Report which are not statements of historical fact, including those under &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; and elsewhere in this Report, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of, and subject to the protections of, Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to Synovus' beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, targets, expectations, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions and future performance and involve known and unknown risks, many of which are beyond Synovus' control and which may cause Synovus' actual results, performance or achievements or the financial services industry or economy generally, to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. 

All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements through Synovus' use of words such as &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;assumes,&#8221; &#8220;predicts,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;potential&#8221; and other similar words and expressions of the future or otherwise regarding the outlook for Synovus' future business and financial performance and/or the performance of the financial services industry and economy in general. Forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of Synovus' management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this document. Many of these factors are beyond Synovus' ability to control or predict. These factors include, but are not limited to: 

(1) competition in the financial services industry, including competition from nontraditional banking institutions such as Fintechs; (2) our ability to realize the expected benefits from our strategic initiatives or other operational and execution goals in the time period expected, which could negatively affect our future profitability; (3) an economic downturn and contraction, including a recession, and the resulting effects on our capital, financial condition, credit quality, results of operations and future growth, including that the strength of the current economic environment could be further weakened by inflation and interest rate fluctuations; (4) changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market; (5) restrictions or limitations on access to funds from historical and alternative sources of liquidity could adversely affect our overall liquidity, which could restrict our ability to make payments on our obligations and our ability to support asset growth and sustain our operations and the operations of Synovus Bank; (6) the impacts of adverse developments in the banking industry, highlighted by high-profile bank failures, on client confidence, liquidity, and regulatory responses to these developments (including increases in the cost of our deposit insurance assessments and increased regulatory scrutiny), our ability to effectively manage our liquidity risk and any growth plans, and the availability of capital and funding; (7) our ability to attract and retain employees and the impact of senior leadership transitions that are key to our strategic initiatives; (8) our strategic implementation of new lines of business, new products and services, and new technologies and the expansion of our existing business opportunities with a renewed focus on innovation; (9) inflation and their effects on our business, profitability, and our stock price as well as the impact on our clients (including the velocity and levels of deposit withdrawals and loan repayment); (10) changes in the interest rate environment, including changes to the federal funds rate, and competition in our primary market area may result in increased funding costs or reduced earning assets yields, thus reducing margins and net interest income; (11) the impact of prolonged elevated interest rates on our financial projections, models, and guidance; (12) the impact of recent, proposed, and potential changes in governmental policy, laws, and regulations, potential, proposed, and recently enacted changes in monetary policy and in the regulation and taxation of banks and financial institutions, or the interpretation or application thereof and the uncertainty of future implementation and enforcement of these regulations, including inflationary pressures and potential interest rate fluctuations; (13) we may be required to make substantial expenditures to keep pace with regulatory initiatives and the rapid technological changes in the financial services industry; (14) our current and future information technology system enhancements and operational initiatives may not be successfully implemented, which could negatively impact our operations; 

(15) our business relationships with, and reliance upon, third parties that have strategic partnerships with us or that provide key components of our business infrastructure, including the costs of services and products provided to us by third parties, and disruptions in service or financial difficulties with a third-party vendor or business relationship; (16) our enterprise risk management framework, our compliance program, or our corporate governance and supervisory oversight functions may not identify or address risks adequately, which may result in unexpected losses; (17) our asset quality may deteriorate or that our allowance for credit losses may prove to be inadequate or may be negatively affected by credit risk exposures; (18) the ability of our operational framework to identify and manage risks associated with our business, such as credit risk, compliance risk, reputational risk, and operational risk, including by virtue of our relationships with third-party business partners, as well as our relationships with third-party vendors and other service providers; (19) we may be exposed to potential losses in the event of fraud and/or theft, or in the event that a third-party vendor, obligor, or business partner fails to pay amounts due to us under that relationship or under any arrangement that we enter into with them; (20) if economic conditions worsen or regulatory capital rules are modified, we may be required to undertake initiatives to improve or conserve our capital position; (21) our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks (including those impacting our vendors and other third parties) such as data security breaches, malware, "denial of service" attacks, "hacking", and identity theft, a failure of which could disrupt our business and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption, or damage of our systems, increased costs, significant losses, or adverse effects to our reputation; (22) the impact on our financial results, reputation, and business if we are unable to comply with all applicable federal and state regulations or other supervisory actions or directives and any necessary capital initiatives; (23) our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends or take other capital actions; (24) our ESG strategies and initiatives, the scope and pace of which could alter our reputation and shareholder, employee, client, and third-party relationships; (25) we could realize losses if we sell assets and the proceeds we receive are lower than the carrying value of such assets; (26) our ability to obtain regulatory approval to take certain actions, including any dividends on our common or preferred stock, any repurchases of common or preferred stock, or any other issuance or redemption of any other regulatory capital instruments, as well as any applications in respect to strategic initiatives; (27) we may not be able to identify suitable bank and non-bank acquisition opportunities as part of our growth strategy and even if we are able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms or realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions; (28) our concentrated operations in the Southeastern U.S. make us vulnerable to local economic conditions, local weather catastrophes, public health issues, and other external events; (29) the costs and effects of litigation, investigations, or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto; (30) the fluctuation in our stock price and general volatility in the stock market; (31) the effects of any damages to our reputation resulting from developments related to any of the items identified above; and (32) other factors and other information contained in this Report and in other reports and filings that we make with the SEC under the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, those found in "Part II - Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Report.

Economic Environment and Recent Events 

Many of the key economic drivers of 2023 &#8211; prolonged elevated interest rates, inflation, economic uncertainty, geopolitical pressures, and changes in monetary policy, among others &#8211; remain relevant in 2024. 

While inflation trended downward in the second quarter of 2024, it remains a key economic concern, although current market sentiment and economic conditions have resulted in predictions that the Federal Reserve may lower market interest rates with one to two potential 25 bps cuts in September and/or December 2024. The specific timing of interest rate cuts is paramount as higher rates continue to pressure asset valuations and make potential refinancing more problematic. 

Outside of inflation, the economic uncertainty and market disruptions of 2023 remain in 2024, including geopolitical tensions from conflict in the Middle East, Russia&#8217;s prolonged war in Ukraine, and the strained relationship between the U.S. and China. Moreover, 2024 is an election year, and there are specific risks and uncertainties related to the election and any change in administration that could impact the economy and fiscal and regulatory policy by varying degrees. Recent events have added an extra dimension of instability to the political environment. 

U.S. fiscal policy has been expansionary in recent years, leaving a federal deficit which will most likely continue to grow. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in August 2022, raised federal revenue by imposing an alternative corporate minimum tax if certain thresholds are met and a non-deductible excise tax on corporate share repurchases. 

The bank failures in March and May of 2023 and the subsequent response by both the banking industry and the Federal Reserve served to mitigate the risks of such failures becoming more systemic. However, the residual impacts on the banking industry and the broader economic environment remain and have generally presented a more challenging outlook for the banking industry and for Synovus. These bank failures resulted in FDIC special assessment expenses, increased regulatory scrutiny, expectations for future regulatory changes, and continued pressure on deposits and liquidity. 

Despite the headwinds discussed above, we believe our presence in strong Southeastern U.S. growth markets positions Synovus to execute on our 2024 updated fundamental guidance outlined below by making prudent decisions around business mix, balance sheet optimization, and operating expenses, all of which will support enhanced financial performance and a return to growth as we proceed through 2024. 

Executive Summary 

Net income (loss) available to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2024 was $(23.7) million, or $(0.16) per diluted common share, compared to $165.8 million, or $1.13 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2023. Net income (loss) available to common shareholders for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $91.1 million, or $0.62 per diluted common share, compared to $359.7 million, or $2.45 per diluted common share, for the six months ended June 30, 2023. 

The year-over-year changes were primarily impacted by losses from sales of AFS investment securities totaling $256.7 million in connection with the strategic repositioning of the investment securities portfolio in the second quarter of 2024 and lower net interest income from continued increases in funding costs and negative deposit remixing. 

Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $853.8 million, down $82.4 million, or 9%, compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest margin was down 20 bps over the comparable six-month period in 2023 to 3.12%, impacted by negative deposit remixing and pricing lags within the deposit portfolio. Net interest margin was up 16 bps on a linked quarter basis, largely driven by improved loan yields, the residual impact of hedge maturities in the first quarter of 2024, and the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio in the second quarter of 2024, along with positive impact from the transfer of investment securities from AFS to HTM on April 1, 2024, which reduced earning assets. 

Non-interest revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $(128.9) million, down $241.1 million, or 215%, and year-to-date was $(10.0) million, down $255.4 million, or 104%, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to the impact of losses totaling $256.7 million from sales of AFS investment securities in connection with the strategic repositioning of the investment securities portfolio in the second quarter of 2024. 

Non-interest expense for the second quarter of 2024 was $301.8 million, down $5.4 million, or 2%, and year-to-date was $624.5 million, a decrease of $4.5 million, or 1% compared to the same periods in 2023. 

At June 30, 2024, loans, net of deferred fees and costs, of $43.09 billion, decreased $311.1 million from December 31, 2023. C&#38;I loans declined slightly, impacted by continued focus on strategically reducing non-relationship loans, lower utilization, and increased paydowns, mostly offset by growth in key strategic business lines. CRE loans declined primarily due to increased transactions from client property sales and refinancings partially offset by relatively stable loan production. The decrease in consumer loans resulted primarily from the continued strategic runoff of the third-party lending portfolio. 

Credit metrics at June 30, 2024 included NPAs and NPLs at 60 bps and 59 bps, respectively, and total past due loans at 30 bps as a percentage of total loans. Net charge-offs were $34.5 million, or 32 bps annualized, and $78.8 million, or 36 bps annualized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. Provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was $26.4 million and $80.4 million, respectively, compared to $38.9 million and $71.0 million 

for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. The changes compared to the prior year periods were mostly driven by increased defaults, including net charge-offs, partially offset by more favorable economic inputs. The ACL at June 30, 2024 totaled $538.2 million, an increase of $1.5 million from December 31, 2023, and the ACL to loans coverage ratio at June 30, 2024 of 1.25% increased 1 bp compared to December 31, 2023. 

Total period-end deposits at June 30, 2024 decreased $543.4 million compared to December 31, 2023, as a $641.0 million decline in brokered deposits, resulting from continued proactive management of our balance sheet position, was somewhat offset by a $97.6 million increase in core deposits. The growth in core deposits was primarily due to continued client demand for time deposits partially offset by a decline in non-interest-bearing demand deposits primarily driven by commercial client deployment of excess funds. Total average deposit costs of 2.68% in the second quarter of 2024, which equate to a cycle-to-date total deposit beta of 49%, increased 1 bp and 73 bps, from the linked quarter and prior year comparable periods, respectively. Total average deposit costs compared to the prior year comparable period were higher primarily due to the aforementioned continued client demand for time deposits along with remixing of non-interest-bearing demand deposits. 

At June 30, 2024, Synovus' CET1 ratio of 10.60% improved 38 bps and 74 bps compared to December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively, as our organic earnings, along with the completion of our risk-weighted assets optimization effort, supported capital accretion that more than offset the strategic repositioning of the investment securities portfolio and share repurchases. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, Synovus repurchased 2.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of $38.95 per share via open market transactions, and during the six months ended June 30, 2024, Synovus repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of $38.54 per share via open market transactions. 

More detail on Synovus' financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 may be found in subsequent sections of "Item 2. &#8211; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Report. See also "Part 1 &#8211; Item 1A. &#8211; Risk Factors" of Synovus' 2023 Form 10-K. 

2024 Updated Fundamental Guidance 

Updated fundamental guidance for 2024, compared to 2023, is based on our current forecast, which incorporates our strategic objectives and assumes stable economic conditions: 

&#8226; end of period loan growth of 0% to 2% 

&#8226; end of period core deposit (1) growth of 2% to 4% 

&#8226; adjusted revenue (decline) growth (2)(3)(4) of (3)% to 0% 

&#8226; adjusted non-interest expense (2)(3)(5) growth of 1% to 3% (excluding FDIC special assessment) 

&#8226; Expect a flat to lower net charge-off ratio in the second half of 2024 (as compared to the first half of 2024), given current credit migration trends 

&#8226; CET1 ratio of 10.0% to 10.5% (high-end) (6) 

&#8226; effective income tax rate of ~21% 

(1) Excludes brokered deposits. 

(2) Non-GAAP financial measure; see "Table 14 - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; of this Report for applicable reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure. 

(3) Guidance based on 2023 baseline: adjusted revenue baseline of $2.28 billion and adjusted non-interest expense of $1.26 billion. Excluding the FDIC special assessment, the amount is $1.21 billion. 

(4) Guidance incorporates a 25 bps interest rate cut in December 2024; forecast interest rate path consistent with June 2024 Federal Reserve dot plot. 

(5) Recorded accrual reversal of $3.9 million in the second quarter of 2024 and accruals for $12.8 million and $51.0 million during the first quarter of 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2023, respectively, related to the FDIC special assessment. 

(6) Will remain opportunistic with share repurchases to manage overall capital levels at or near the top of the range. 

Changes in Financial Condition 

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, total assets decreased $203.2 million compared to December 31, 2023 to $59.61 billion. Investment securities totaled $9.71 billion and declined $76.9 million from December 31, 2023. During the second quarter of 2024, Synovus sold at amortized cost $1.62 billion of mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises from AFS, which resulted in realized net losses of $256.7 million. Synovus also purchased $1.48 billion in total principal of AFS securities including U.S. Treasury securities, mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. Government agencies, and commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. Government agencies or sponsored enterprises. On April 1, 2024, Synovus transferred $2.72 billion in fair value of investment securities from AFS to HTM, which reduced our exposure to potential volatility associated with investment security market price fluctuations. At the time of transfer, $708.5 million of pre-tax unrealized losses were retained in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized over the remaining life of the securities. See "Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies and Note 2 - Investment Securities" in this Report for more information on the securities transfer and repositioning. 

Loans, net of deferred fees and costs, decreased $311.1 million compared to December 31, 2023. C&#38;I loans declined slightly, impacted by continued focus on strategically reducing non-relationship loans, lower utilization, and increased paydowns, mostly offset by growth in key strategic business lines. CRE loans declined primarily due to increased transactions from client property sales and refinancings partially offset by relatively stable loan production. The decrease in consumer loans resulted primarily from the continued strategic runoff of the third-party lending portfolio. 

Deposits decreased $543.4 million compared to December 31, 2023, as a $641.0 million decline in brokered deposits, resulting from continued proactive management of our balance sheet position, was somewhat offset by a $97.6 million increase in core deposits. The loan to deposit ratio was 85.9% at June 30, 2024 as compared to 85.5% at December 31, 2023. Long-term debt increased $351.2 million from December 31, 2023, driven by $350.0 million higher long-term FHLB advances. 

Total Synovus Financial Corp. shareholders' equity at June 30, 2024 decreased $66.4 million compared to December 31, 2023, driven by a decrease of $121.8 million for common stock repurchases and a decline in retained earnings, which included common and preferred stock dividends of $110.4 million and $19.4 million, respectively, mostly offset by net income attributable to Synovus Financial Corp. of $110.5 million. In addition, a reduction in after-tax net unrealized losses on investment securities AFS of $587.7 million was mostly offset by a $521.8 million in after-tax net unrealized losses on investment securities HTM that were transferred from investment securities AFS.

At June 30, 2024, loans, net of deferred fees and costs of $43.09 billion, decreased $311.1 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2023. C&#38;I loans declined slightly, impacted by continued focus on strategically reducing non-relationship loans, lower utilization, and increased paydowns, mostly offset by growth in key strategic business lines. CRE loans declined primarily due to increased transactions from client property sales and refinancings partially offset by relatively stable loan production. The decrease in consumer loans resulted primarily from the continued strategic runoff of the third-party lending portfolio. 

C&#38;I loans remain the largest component of our loan portfolio, representing 52.3% of total loans, while CRE and consumer loans represent 28.3% and 19.4%, respectively. Our portfolio composition is guided by our strategic growth plan, in conjunction with a comprehensive concentration management policy which sets limits for C&#38;I, CRE, and consumer loan levels as well as sub-categories therein. 

Commercial Loans 

Total commercial loans (which are comprised of C&#38;I and CRE loans) at June 30, 2024 were $34.75 billion, or 80.6% of the total loan portfolio, compared to $34.92 billion, or 80.4%, at December 31, 2023. 

Commercial and Industrial Loans 

The C&#38;I loan portfolio represents the largest category of Synovus' loan portfolio and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a diverse set of industries as well as certain specialized lending verticals. The following table shows the composition of the C&#38;I loan portfolio aggregated by NAICS code. In accordance with Synovus' lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process, which incorporates uniform underwriting standards and oversight in proportion to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 94.9% and 94.8%, respectively, of Synovus' C&#38;I loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventory, and other types of collateral. C&#38;I loans at June 30, 2024 decreased $61.9 million from December 31, 2023, and resulted primarily from continued strategic decline from non-relationship loans, lower utilization, and increased paydowns, mostly offset by growth in key business lines, led by middle market, specialty finance, and CIB.

(2) Comprised of NAICS industries that are less than 1% of total C&#38;I loans at June 30, 2024. 

At June 30, 2024, $14.52 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 33.7% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing commercial, financial and agricultural business activities. The primary source of repayment on these loans is revenue generated from products or services offered by the business or organization. The secondary source of repayment is 

the collateral, which consists primarily of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, time deposits, cash surrender value of life insurance, and other business assets. 

At June 30, 2024, $8.02 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 18.6% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing owner-occupied properties. The financing of owner-occupied facilities is considered a C&#38;I loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral such as senior housing facilities. This treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The secondary source of repayment on these loans is the underlying real estate. These loans are predominantly secured by owner-occupied and other real estate and, to a lesser extent, other types of collateral. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

CRE loans consist primarily of income-producing investment properties loans. Additionally, CRE loans include 1-4 family properties loans as well as land and development loans. In accordance with our lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process which incorporates uniform underwriting standards and oversight relative to the type of property, as well as the size and complexity of the deal. Total CRE loans of $12.22 billion decreased $101.3 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2023, primarily due to elevated levels of transaction activity from client property sales and refinancings partially offset by relatively stable loan production. 

Investment properties loans consist of construction and mortgage loans for income-producing properties and are primarily made to finance multi-family properties, hotels, office buildings, shopping centers, warehouses and other commercial development properties. Total investment properties loans as of June 30, 2024 were $11.33 billion, or 92.7% of the CRE loan portfolio, and decreased $35.3 million from December 31, 2023. 

The following table shows the principal categories of the investment properties loan portfolio at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

(2) LTV calculated by dividing most recent appraisal (typically at origination) on non-construction component of portfolio by the respective June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 commitment amount and senior lien. 

1-4 Family Properties Loans 

1-4 family properties loans include construction loans to home builders and commercial mortgage loans related to 1-4 family rental properties and are almost always secured by the underlying property being financed by such loans. These properties are primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. At June 30, 2024, 1-4 family properties loans totaled $552.5 million, or 4.5% of the CRE loan portfolio, and decreased $46.0 million from December 31, 2023. 

Land and Development Loans 

Land and development loans include commercial and residential development as well as land acquisition loans and are secured by land held for future development, typically in excess of one year. Properties securing these loans are substantially within markets served by Synovus, and loan terms generally include personal guarantees from the principals. Loans in this portfolio are underwritten based on the LTV of the collateral and the capacity of the guarantor(s). Land and development loans of $334.9 million at June 30, 2024 decreased $20.1 million from December 31, 2023. 

Consumer Loans 

The consumer loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through Synovus' banking network, including first and second residential mortgages, home equity and consumer credit card loans, as well as both secured and 

unsecured loans from third-party lending. As of June 30, 2024, weighted-average FICO scores within the residential real estate portfolio based on committed balances were 782 for consumer mortgages and 796 for home equity, consistent with year-end 2023 scores. 

Consumer loans at June 30, 2024 of $8.34 billion decreased $147.9 million, or 2%, compared to December 31, 2023. Mortgage loans decreased $40.6 million from December 31, 2023 largely due to lower production as a result of continued elevated mortgage interest rates. Other consumer loans decreased $97.7 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to continued strategic runoff of the third-party lending portfolio. 

Deposits 

Deposits provide the most significant funding source for interest earning assets. The following table shows the composition of period-end deposits as of the dates indicated. See Table 11 - Quarter-to-Date Net Interest Income and Rate/Volume Analysis and Table 12 - Year-to-Date Net Interest Income and Rate/Volume Analysis in this Report for information on average deposits including average rates.

(1) Deposits balance in each category expressed as percentage of total deposits. 

(2) Excluding any public funds or brokered deposits. 

(3) Core deposits exclude brokered deposits. 

Total period-end deposits at June 30, 2024 decreased $543.4 million compared to December 31, 2023 as a $641.0 million decline in brokered deposits, resulting from continued proactive management of our balance sheet position, was somewhat offset by a $97.6 million increase in core deposits. The growth in core deposits was primarily due to continued client demand for time deposits partially offset by a decline in non-interest-bearing demand deposits primarily driven by commercial client deployment of excess funds. 

Total average deposit costs of 2.68% in the second quarter of 2024, which equate to a cycle-to-date total deposit beta of 49%, increased 1 bp and 73 bps, from the prior quarter and prior year comparable periods, respectively. Total average deposit costs compared to the prior year comparable period were higher primarily due to the aforementioned continued client demand for time deposits along with remixing of non-interest-bearing demand deposits. 

As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $24.09 billion and $23.77 billion, respectively, of our deposit portfolio was uninsured. The uninsured amounts are estimated based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory reporting requirements. At June 30, 2024, approximately 84% of our deposits are either insured (53%), collateralized (14%), or could be insured by switching to our insured cash sweep program, which has existing capacity (17%).

Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2023 

Non-interest revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $(128.9) million, down $241.1 million, or 215%, and year-to-date was $(10.0) million, down $255.4 million, or 104%, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to the impact of losses from sales of AFS investment securities totaling $256.7 million in connection with the strategic repositioning of the investment securities portfolio in the second quarter of 2024. The year-to-date decline was also driven by the prior year $13.1 million one-time benefit from the recovery of a non-performing asset related to the regulatory approval of our Qualpay investment. 

Service charges on deposit accounts, consisting of account analysis fees, NSF fees, and all other service charges declined slightly over the prior year comparable periods. The largest category of service charges, account analysis fees, were up $1.5 million, or 14%, compared to the second quarter of 2023 and increased $2.4 million, or 12% on a comparable year-to-date basis largely due to a reduction in waivers in the second quarter of 2024. NSF/overdraft fees were down $1.4 million, or 22%, and $3.2 million, or 25%, on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis, respectively, primarily due to the impact of NSF/overdraft fee program changes implemented in the third quarter of 2023. All other service charges on deposit accounts, which consist primarily of monthly fees on consumer demand deposits and small business accounts, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 were down $718 thousand, or 11%, and $948 thousand, or 8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. 

Fiduciary and asset management fees are derived from providing estate administration, personal trust, corporate trust, corporate bond, investment management, financial planning, and family office services. Fiduciary and asset management fees were down for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by a decline in asset management income impacted by the sale of GLOBALT on September 30, 2023 partially offset by higher trust fees, including increased investment advisor fees. 

Card fees consist primarily of credit card interchange fees, debit card interchange fees, and merchant revenue. Card fees are reported net of certain associated expense items, including client loyalty program expenses and network expenses. Merchant revenue relates to the fees that are charged to merchant clients based on a percentage of their credit or debit card transaction volume amounts. Card fees for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 were up compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to merchant fees related to our Qualpay investment being higher by $2.1 million and $5.7 million, respectively. 

Brokerage revenue consists primarily of brokerage commissions as well as advisory fees earned from the management of client assets. Brokerage revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 decreased 9% and 7%, respectively, over the prior year comparable periods, with the decline mainly attributable to repurchase volume associated with a single municipal client, partially offset by higher market-driven advisory fees and increased rate-driven annuities revenue. 

Mortgage banking income, consisting of net gains on loan origination/sales activities, decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to a decline in volume of loans originated and sold due to the rate environment. Secondary market production was $146.7 million, a decline of $17.4 million, or 11%, compared to the second quarter of 2023 while year-to-date, it was $251.6 million, a decrease of $18.3 million, or 7%, compared to the same period in 2023. 

Capital markets income primarily includes fee income from client derivative transactions, debt capital market transactions, foreign exchange, gains (losses) from sales of SBA loans, as well as other miscellaneous income from capital market transactions. The increase in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023 was primarily due to $3.0 million higher debt capital market transaction fees, a $1.3 million increase in fees on client derivative transactions, $1.0 million higher loan syndication arranger fees, and an $851 thousand increase in gains on sales of SBA loans, partially offset by $1.3 million lower LIHTC-related income. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was largely impacted by our strong performance in the first quarter of 2023 and the change in the rate environment, with client derivative transactions $3.4 million lower and loan syndication arranger fees also down by $2.0 million, partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in debt capital market transaction fees. 

The main components of other non-interest revenue are fees for letters of credit and unused lines of credit, safe deposit box fees, access fees for ATM use, other service charges and loan servicing fees, earnings on equity method investments, commercial sponsorship income, including transaction and servicing fees associated with a third-party lending relationship, and other miscellaneous items. The three months ended June 30, 2024 increase compared to the prior year was largely due to $7.4 million higher commercial sponsorship income and $1.1 million in other real estate rental/operational income. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was largely attributable to $15.2 million higher commercial sponsorship income and $1.1 million in other real estate rental/operational income. 

Non-interest Expense 

The following table summarizes the components of non-interest expense.

Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2023 

Non-interest expense for the second quarter of 2024 was $301.8 million, down $5.4 million, or 2%, and year-to-date was $624.5 million, a decrease of $4.5 million, or 1% compared to the same periods in 2023. 

Salaries and other personnel expense decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to the impact of headcount reductions, lower temporary help expense, and lower production-based mortgage commissions, partially offset by unfavorable impact from deferred loan origination costs driven by the overall mix of loan production. The six months ended 

June 30, 2024 decrease was largely the result of lower temporary help expense, lower employee insurance from decreased claims in 2024, decreased production-based mortgage commissions, and headcount reductions, partially offset by unfavorable impact from deferred loan origination costs driven by lower loan production. Total headcount of 4,805 was down by 374, or 7%, compared to June 30, 2023 primarily as a result of the voluntary early retirement program offered to certain qualified employees in 2023, in addition to strategic reductions in areas primarily impacted by production volume declines. 

Net occupancy, equipment, and software expense increased compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to ongoing investments in technology in addition to increased property expense. 

Third-party processing and other services expense includes all third-party core operating system and processing charges as well as third-party loan servicing charges. Third-party processing expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024 decreased compared to the same period in 2023 largely due to lower servicing fees associated with decreased third-party consumer loans. 

Professional fees were up for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 largely due to higher legal fees associated with the process of resolving certain loan relationships while the six months ended June 30, 2024 increase was partially offset by higher consulting fees for the six months ended June 30, 2023 that primarily related to projects now placed in service. 

FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2024 largely due to a $3.9 million reversal related to the FDIC special assessment based on the invoice received from the FDIC in the second quarter of 2024. The six months ended June 30, 2024 increase was driven by an $8.9 million accrual related to updated estimates of the FDIC special assessment. 

Amortization of intangibles increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 due to Synovus' acquisition of Qualpay in the second quarter of 2023. 

During the three months ended June 30, 2024, restructuring charges (reversals) primarily consisted of $518 thousand in gains on the sale of two branches and $456 thousand in net severance reversals partially offset by $316 thousand in common area maintenance charges related to corporate offices/branches while the restructuring charges for the six months ended June 30, 2024 included $1.7 million in asset impairment/lease termination and common area maintenance charges related to corporate offices/branches partially offset by the gains on the sale of two branches and net severance reversals. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, Synovus recorded restructuring charges (reversals) including $1.9 million and $3.3 million, respectively, in gains on the sale of branches previously closed, partially offset by $1.7 million and $2.1 million, respectively, of severance. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, Synovus recorded losses of $2.4 million and $19.1 million, respectively, associated with fair value adjustments on other loans held for sale due to the transfer of $3.8 million and $427.9 million, respectively, in third-party consumer loans to held for sale. 

Other operating expense includes advertising, travel, insurance, network and communication, other taxes, subscriptions and dues, other loan and ORE expense, postage and freight, training, business development, supplies, donations, and other miscellaneous expense. Other operating expense was down slightly from the comparable periods in 2023 largely due to efforts to reduce client fraud and other operational losses as well as other prudent expense management efforts. 

Income Tax Expense 

Synovus recognized a $7.4 million income tax benefit for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $47.8 million of tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2023, representing effective tax rates of 33.4% and 21.6%, respectively. Income tax expense was $29.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to income tax expense of $105.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, representing effective tax rates of 21.3% and 21.9%, respectively. 

A net tax benefit was recognized for the three months ended June 30, 2024, due to the overall pre-tax loss generated by the strategic repositioning of our investment securities portfolio. The effective tax rate was higher for the quarter as the net tax benefit on the pre-tax loss was compounded by tax credits and various discrete tax benefit items. 

CREDIT QUALITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 

Credit Quality 

Synovus diligently monitors the quality of its loan portfolio by industry, property type, and geography through a thorough portfolio review process and our analytical risk management tools. At, June 30, 2024, credit metrics included NPAs and NPLs at 60 bps and 59 bps, respectively, and total past due loans at 30 bps as a percentage of total loans. Net charge-offs were $34.5 million, or 32 bps annualized, and $78.8 million, or 36 bps annualized, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. 

The table below includes selected credit quality metrics.

Non-performing Assets 

Total NPAs were $256.9 million at June 30, 2024, a $31.2 million, or 11%, decrease from December 31, 2023 primarily due to the resolution of a few non-performing relationships and lower NPL inflows. 

Criticized and Classified Loans 

Our loan ratings are aligned to federal banking regulators' definitions of pass and criticized categories, which include special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. Substandard accruing and non-accruing loans, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as classified. Special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as criticized and classified loans. The following table presents a summary of criticized and classified loans. Criticized and 

classified loans at June 30, 2024 increased $63.0 million compared to December 31, 2023.

Provision for (Reversal of) Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses was $26.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to a provision of $38.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by more favorable economic inputs, partially offset by increased defaults, including net charge-offs. Net charge-offs for the three months ended June 30, 2024 were $34.5 million, compared to $26.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses was $80.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $71.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was predominantly driven by increased defaults, including net charge-offs, partially offset by more favorable economic inputs. Net charge-offs for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were $78.8 million, compared to $44.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. 

The ALL of $485.1 million and the reserve for unfunded commitments of $53.1 million, which is recorded in other liabilities, comprise the total ACL of $538.2 million at June 30, 2024. The ACL increased $1.5 million compared to the December 31, 2023 ACL of $536.6 million, which consisted of an ALL of $479.4 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments of $57.2 million. The ACL to loans coverage ratio of 1.25% at June 30, 2024 increased 1 bp compared to December 31, 2023. The slight increase in the ACL from December 31, 2023 resulted primarily from credit performance that included downward migration and a qualitative adjustment, as well as net loan production. This was partially offset by improved economic inputs. 

Capital Resources 

Synovus and Synovus Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by our primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve. Synovus and Synovus Bank measure capital adequacy using the standardized approach under Basel III. At June 30, 2024, Synovus and Synovus Bank's capital levels remained strong and exceeded well-capitalized 

requirements currently in effect. The following table presents certain ratios used to measure Synovus and Synovus Bank's capitalization. 

Table 10 - Capital Ratios (dollars in thousands) June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 CET1 capital Synovus Financial Corp. $ 5,075,459 &#160; $ 5,206,521 Synovus Bank 5,479,117 &#160; 5,559,624 Tier 1 risk-based capital Synovus Financial Corp. 5,612,604 &#160; 5,743,666 Synovus Bank 5,479,117 &#160; 5,559,624 Total risk-based capital Synovus Financial Corp. 6,494,654 &#160; 6,654,224 Synovus Bank 6,190,365 &#160; 6,249,947 CET1 capital ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 10.60 &#160; % 10.22 % Synovus Bank 11.46 &#160; 10.93 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 11.72 &#160; 11.28 Synovus Bank 11.46 &#160; 10.93 Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 13.56 &#160; 13.07 Synovus Bank 12.95 &#160; 12.29 Leverage ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 9.44 &#160; 9.49 Synovus Bank 9.23 &#160; 9.21 

At June 30, 2024, Synovus' CET1 ratio of 10.60% improved 38 bps compared to December 31, 2023, as our organic earnings, along with the completion of our risk-weighted assets optimization effort, supported capital accretion that more than offset the strategic repositioning of the investment securities portfolio and share repurchases. We will continue to maintain a disciplined approach to capital management, which balances the uncertain economic environment with prudent management near the top-end of our 10.0% to 10.5% CET1 ratio range. Our focus remains on prioritizing the deployment of our balance sheet and capital position for core client growth; however, we expect to complement that with share repurchases to effectively manage within our capital management framework. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 - Regulatory Capital" to the consolidated financial statements of Synovus' 2023 Form 10-K. Management reviews the Company's capital position on an on-going basis and believes, based on internal capital analyses and earnings projections, that Synovus is well positioned to meet relevant regulatory capital standards. 

The Company announced on January 18, 2024 that its Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $300 million of common stock and $50 million of preferred stock in 2024. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, Synovus repurchased 2.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of $38.95 per share via open market transactions. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, Synovus repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of $38.54 per share via open market transactions. 

On August 26, 2020, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule that allowed electing banking organizations that adopted CECL during 2020 to mitigate the estimated effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in transition period. Synovus adopted CECL on January 1, 2020, and the June 30, 2024 regulatory capital ratios reflect Synovus' election of the five-year transition provision. At June 30, 2024, $14.6 million, or a cumulative 3 bps benefit to CET1, was deferred. 

Dividends 

Synovus has historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of its common stock. Management and the Board of Directors closely monitor current and projected capital levels, liquidity (including dividends from subsidiaries), financial markets and other economic trends, as well as regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends. 

Synovus' ability to pay dividends on its common stock and preferred stock is primarily dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from its bank and non-banking subsidiaries, which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities. 

Synovus declared common stock dividends of $110.4 million, or $0.76 per common share, for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $111.0 million, or $0.76 per common share, for the six months ended June 30, 2023. In addition, Synovus declared dividends on its preferred stock of $19.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $16.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers, and creditors; to support asset growth; and to otherwise sustain operations of Synovus and its subsidiaries, at a reasonable cost, on a timely basis, and without adverse consequences. ALCO monitors Synovus' economic, competitive, and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk. 

In accordance with Synovus policies and regulatory guidance, ALCO evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the Company&#8217;s liquidity profile. Synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors, borrowers, and creditors on a timely basis. Liquidity is generated through various sources, including, but not limited to, maturities and repayments of loans by clients, maturities and sales of investment securities, and growth in core and wholesale deposits. 

Synovus Bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Synovus Bank accesses funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of funding and liquidity. Synovus Bank also has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the FHLB system and the Federal Reserve. Management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage client deposit withdrawals, loan requests, and other funding demands. 

Total deposits at June 30, 2024 decreased $543.4 million compared to December 31, 2023, with a $641.0 million decline in brokered deposits, resulting from continued proactive management of our balance sheet position, that was somewhat offset by a $97.6 million increase in core deposits. The growth in core deposits was primarily due to continued client demand for time deposits partially offset by a decline in non-interest-bearing demand deposits primarily driven by commercial client deployment of excess funds. Synovus continues to proactively manage its liquidity position, which has included the level of brokered deposits, and robust contingent liquidity is maintained across a diverse set of sources which include immediately available funds as well as funds we expect to be available within short notice. Contingent liquidity sources include primary sources such as FHLB borrowing capacity, FRB cash reserves, unencumbered securities, and third-party consumer loans, which includes our decision to sell loans from this portfolio and strategic runoff, while secondary sources consist of the Federal Reserve discount window, Fed Funds lines, and other sources. At June 30, 2024, contingent sources of liquidity totaled approximately $27.0 billion, and based on currently pledged collateral, Synovus Bank had access to FHLB funding of $7.58 billion, subject to FHLB credit policies. 

In addition to bank level liquidity management, Synovus must manage liquidity at the Parent Company level for various operating needs, including the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, payment of general corporate expense, and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries. The primary source of liquidity for Synovus consists of dividends from Synovus Bank, which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the GA DBF and the Federal Reserve Bank. Synovus' ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank's future profits, asset quality, liquidity, and overall condition. In addition, both the GA DBF and Federal Reserve Bank may require approval to pay dividends, based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations. 

Synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above, including existing liquid funds on hand, are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs. However, if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate, regulatory capital requirements for Synovus or Synovus Bank were to increase as a result of directives or otherwise, or Synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels, then Synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources. See "Part I &#8211; Item 1A. Risk Factors - Market and Other General Risk - Recent negative developments affecting the banking industry, and resulting media coverage, have eroded client confidence in the banking system , and Credit and Liquidity Risk - Changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity and financial results , " of Synovus' 2023 Form 10-K. Furthermore, Synovus may, from time to time, take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance, retire, or repurchase its existing debt, redeem or issue its preferred stock, repurchase shares, or strengthen its liquidity or capital position. 

Earning Assets and Sources of Funds 

Average earning assets decreased $1.88 billion in the first six months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decline in average earning assets primarily resulted from an average total loans, net of unearned income, decrease of $575.8 

million, $486.1 million lower average investment securities (amortized cost basis), an average other loans held for sale decline of $437.9 million, and a $231.0 million decrease in average other earning assets primarily driven by lower interest-bearing funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank from an elevated cash position amidst banking industry uncertainty that began near the end of the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in average total loans, net of unearned income, was largely due to a continued focus on strategically reducing non-relationship loans, increased paydowns, and a decline in third-party consumer loans from continued run-off. The lower average investment securities (amortized cost basis) were primarily due to the transfer of investment securities from AFS to HTM on April 1, 2024, which included unrealized losses at the date of transfer that will be amortized over the remaining life of the securities as an adjustment to yield, offsetting the amortization of the discount resulting from the transfer recorded at fair value. The decline in average other loans held for sale was primarily attributable to sales of third-party consumer loans in 2023. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $538.2 million for the first six months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities largely resulted from increases of $3.91 billion and $1.20 billion in average time deposits and average interest-bearing demand deposits, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of $1.21 billion in average money market accounts, as well as decreases of $972.5 million, and $1.77 billion in average other short-term borrowings and average long-term debt, respectively. The increases in time deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits and decrease in money market accounts were correlated as fluctuations between these categories have been driven by the rate environment. The decreases in other short-term borrowings and long-term debt were largely due to the ongoing management of our liquidity position. Average non-interest-bearing demand deposits decreased $2.36 billion for the first six months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to the continued pressures from the rate environment and client deployment of excess funds. 

Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $853.8 million, down $82.4 million, or 9%, compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest margin was down 20 bps over the comparable period to 3.12%, impacted by negative deposit remixing and pricing lags within the deposit portfolio. 

On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up $16.2 million, or 4%, primarily driven by improved loan yields, the residual impact of hedge maturities in the first quarter of 2024, and the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio in the second quarter of 2024. In addition, total average deposit costs were relatively stable, and deposit mix trends resulted in a more modest headwind. Net interest margin for the second quarter of 2024 was up 16 bps compared to the first quarter of 2024 largely due to the same factors that drove net interest income higher along with a positive impact from the transfer of investment securities from AFS to HTM, which reduced earning assets. The transfer of investment securities from AFS to HTM added 4 bps to the net interest margin sequentially. The repositioning of the investment securities portfolio added 5 bps to the net interest margin sequentially as the book yield of AFS securities purchased was approximately 5.0% while the book yield of AFS securities sold was approximately 1.4%. We continue to expect net interest margin expansion, driven by fixed-rate asset repricing and hedge maturities in the fourth quarter of 2024, as well as the full impact of the investment securities repositioning which was completed in May of 2024. See "Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 - Investment Securities" in this Report for more information on the securities transfer and repositioning.

Market Risk Analysis 

Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Synovus is potentially exposed. Synovus measures the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates through the use of simulation modeling, which incorporates all of Synovus&#8217; earning assets and liabilities. These simulations are used to determine a baseline net interest income projection and the sensitivity of the income profile based on changes in interest rates. These simulations incorporate assumptions and factors, including, but not limited to, changes in market rates, in the size or composition of the balance sheet, and in repricing characteristics as well as client behaviors for both loans and deposits. This includes estimates for deposit repricing characteristics which, for purposes of the sensitivity estimates provided below, relies upon a constant, through-the-cycle total deposit cost beta of approximately 45% as of the most recently reported period. This process is reviewed and updated on an on-going basis in a manner consistent with Synovus&#8217; ALCO governance framework. 

Synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income forecast assuming an interest rate projection that is flat to June 30, 2024 interest rate curves, with the federal funds rate at the Federal Reserve&#8217;s targeted range of 5.25% to 5.50% as of June 30, 2024 and the prime rate of 8.50% as of June 30, 2024. Synovus has modeled the impact of an immediate change in market interest rates across the yield curve of 100 and 200 bps to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next 12 months. As illustrated in the table below, the net interest income sensitivity derived from this simulation suggests that net interest income is projected to increase by 2.8% and 1.4% if interest rates increased by 200 and 100 bps, respectively. Net interest income is projected to decrease by 1.5% and 2.9% if interest rates decreased by 100 and 200 bps, respectively. 

The following table represents the estimated sensitivity of net interest income at June 30, 2024, with comparable information for December 31, 2023. 

Table 13 - Twelve Month Net Interest Income Sensitivity Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income as Compared to Unchanged Rates (for the next 12 months) Change in Interest Rates (in bps) June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 +200 2.8% 3.7% +100 1.4 1.9 -100 (1.5) (2.0) -200 (2.9) (4.1) 

While all of the above estimates are reflective of the general interest rate sensitivity of Synovus, local market conditions, the realized growth and remixing of the balance sheet, as well as the broader macroeconomic environment could all have a significant impact on both the sensitivity and realized level of net interest income. Additionally, should there be differences between realized deposit betas for a given level of rates as compared to the Company's estimates for through-the-cycle betas, this may also have a significant impact on our reported sensitivity and the realized level of net interest income. 

The net interest income simulation model is the primary tool utilized to evaluate potential interest rate risks over a shorter-term time horizon. Synovus also evaluates potential longer-term interest rate risk through modeling and evaluation of the sensitivity of the Company's EVE. The EVE measurement process estimates the net fair value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet financial instruments under various interest rate scenarios. Management uses EVE sensitivity analyses as an additional means of measuring interest rate risk and incorporates this form of analysis within its governance and limits framework. 

Synovus is also subject to market risk in certain of its fee income business lines. Financial management services revenue, which include trust, brokerage, and asset management fees, can be affected by risk in the securities markets, primarily the equity securities market. A significant portion of the fees in this unit are determined based upon a percentage of asset values. Weaker securities markets and lower equity values have an adverse impact on the fees generated by these operations. Trading account assets, maintained to facilitate brokerage client activity, are also subject to market risk; however, trading activities are limited and subject to risk policy limits. Additionally, Synovus utilizes various tools to measure and manage price risk in its trading portfolio. 

Mortgage banking income is also subject to market risk. Mortgage loan originations are sensitive to levels of mortgage interest rates and therefore, mortgage banking income can be negatively impacted during periods of rising interest rates as we experienced during the prior year along with volatility in interest rates during the current year. The extension of commitments to clients to fund mortgage loans also subjects Synovus to market risk. This risk is primarily created by the time periods between making the commitment, closing, and delivering the loan. Synovus seeks to minimize its exposure by utilizing various risk management tools, including forward sales commitments and other economic hedges. 

Derivative Instruments for Interest Rate Risk Management 

Synovus utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to various types of structural interest rate risks by executing end-user derivative transactions designated as hedges. Hedging relationships may be designated as either a cash flow hedge, which mitigates risk exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions, or a fair value hedge, which mitigates risk exposure to adverse changes in the fair market value of a fixed rate asset or liability due to changes in market interest rates. 

As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Synovus had $4.60 billion and $5.60 billion, respectively, in notional amounts outstanding of both effective and forward-starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedging instruments to hedge its exposure to contractually specified interest rate risk associated with floating rate loans. 

As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Synovus had $2.38 billion and $2.56 billion, respectively, in notional amounts outstanding of receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedging instruments to hedge its exposure to the change in the fair value due to fluctuations in market interest rates for outstanding fixed-rate long-term debt and fixed-rate interest-bearing deposits. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of Synovus are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as &#8220;critical accounting policies,&#8221; consisting of those related to the allowance for credit losses and income taxes. In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, Synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management's practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors' Audit Committee on a periodic basis, including the development, selection, implementation, and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on Synovus&#8217; unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. Synovus&#8217; financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies. All accounting policies described in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Synovus' 2023 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance. There have been no significant changes to the accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions, or the judgments affecting the application of these estimates and assumptions from those disclosed in Synovus' 2023 Form 10-K. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The measures entitled adjusted non-interest revenue, adjusted non-interest expense, adjusted revenue, adjusted tangible efficiency ratio, adjusted pre-provision net revenue (PPNR), adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted net income per common share, diluted, adjusted return on average assets, adjusted return on average common equity, return on average tangible common equity, adjusted return on average tangible common equity, and tangible common equity ratio, are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The most comparable GAAP measures to these measures are total non-interest revenue, total non-interest expense, total revenue, efficiency ratio-TE, PPNR, net income (loss) available to common shareholders, net income (loss) per common share, diluted, return on average assets, return on average common equity, and the ratio of total shareholders' equity to total assets, respectively. 

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about Synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating Synovus&#8217; operating results, financial strength, the performance of its business, and the strength of its capital position. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors, and since they are not required to be uniformly applied, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies. Adjusted revenue and adjusted non-interest revenue are measures used by management to evaluate total revenue and non-interest revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains (losses), fair value adjustments on non-qualified deferred compensation, and other items not indicative of ongoing operations that could impact period-to-period comparisons. Adjusted non-interest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted net income per common share, diluted, adjusted return on average assets, and adjusted return on average common equity are measures used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. Adjusted PPNR is used by management to evaluate PPNR exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. Return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity are measures used by management to compare Synovus' performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible 

assets and their related amortization, thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently. The tangible common equity ratio is used by stakeholders to assess our capital position. The computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below. 

Management does not provide a reconciliation for forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the occurrence and the financial impact of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of Synovus&#8217; control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, Synovus&#8217; management is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.
