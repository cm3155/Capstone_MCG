FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain statements made or incorporated by reference in this Report which are not statements of historical fact, including those under &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; and elsewhere in this Report, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of, and subject to the protections of, Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to Synovus' beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, targets, expectations, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions and future performance and involve known and unknown risks, many of which are beyond Synovus' control and which may cause Synovus' actual results, performance or achievements or the financial services industry or economy generally, to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. 

All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements through Synovus' use of words such as &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;assumes,&#8221; &#8220;predicts,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;potential&#8221; and other similar words and expressions of the future or otherwise regarding the outlook for Synovus' future business and financial performance and/or the performance of the financial services industry and economy in general. Forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of Synovus' management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this document. Many of these factors are beyond Synovus' ability to control or predict. These factors include, but are not limited to: 

(1) the risks and uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our assets, business, capital and liquidity, financial condition, prospects and results of operations; 

(2) the risk that the current and any further economic downturn and contraction could have a material adverse effect on our capital, liquidity, financial condition, credit quality, results of operations and future growth, including the risk that the current economic contraction could last much longer and be much more severe if efforts to contain the pandemic are unsuccessful and restrictions on movement last longer than currently anticipated; 

(3) &#160; the risk that our asset quality may deteriorate, our allowance for credit losses may prove to be inadequate or may be negatively affected by credit risk exposures, and the risk that we may be unable to obtain full payment in respect of any loan or other receivables; 

(4) changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market; 

(5) &#160; the risks that if economic conditions worsen further or regulatory capital rules are modified, we may be required to undertake initiatives to improve our capital position;

(8) &#160; changes in the interest rate environment, including changes to the federal funds rate to include a possible negative interest rate environment, and competition in our primary market area may result in increased funding costs or reduced earning assets yields, thus further reducing margins and net interest income; 

(9) the risk that competition in the financial services industry may adversely affect our future earnings and growth; 

(10) &#160; the risk that we may not realize the expected benefits from our efficiency and growth initiatives or that we may not be able to realize those cost savings or revenue initiatives in the time period expected, which could negatively impact our future profitability; 

(11) &#160; our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks such as data security breaches, malware, "denial of service" attacks, "hacking" and identity theft, a failure of which could disrupt our business and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption or damage of our systems, increased costs, significant losses, or adverse effects to our reputation; 

(12) &#160; the risk that our current and future information technology system enhancements and operational initiatives may not be successfully implemented, which could negatively impact our operations; 

(13) &#160; our ability to attract and retain employees that are key to our strategic and growth initiatives; 

(14) &#160; the risk related to our implementation of new lines of business, new products and services or new technologies;

(16) &#160; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends or take other capital actions; 

(17) &#160; the risk that our enterprise risk management framework, our compliance program, or our corporate governance and supervisory oversight functions may not identify or address risks adequately, which may result in unexpected losses; 

(18) &#160; risks related to our business relationships with, and reliance upon, third parties that have strategic partnerships with us or that provide key components of our business infrastructure, including the costs of services and products provided to us by third parties, and risks related to disruptions in service or financial difficulties with a third-party vendor or business relationship; 

(19) risks related to the ability of our operational framework to identify and manage risks associated with our business such as credit risk, compliance risk, reputational risk, and operational risk, including third-party business partners, as well as our relationship with third-party vendors and other service providers; 

(20) &#160; the risk that we may be exposed to potential losses in the event of fraud and/or theft, or in the event that a third-party vendor, obligor, or business partner fails to pay amounts due to us under that relationship or under any arrangement that we enter into with them; 

(21) &#160; the risk that we could realize losses if we sell non-performing assets and the proceeds we receive are lower than the carrying value of such assets; 

(22) &#160; risks related to the fluctuation in our stock price and general volatility in the stock market; 

(23) &#160; the impact on our financial results, reputation, and business if we are unable to comply with all applicable federal and state regulations or other supervisory actions or directives and any necessary capital initiatives; 

(24) &#160; risks related to regulatory approval to take certain actions, including any dividends on our common stock or preferred stock, any repurchases of common stock or any issuance or redemption of any other regulatory capital instruments;

(26) &#160; the costs and effects of litigation, investigations, inquiries or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, including the costs and effects of litigation related to our participation in government stimulus programs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic;

COVID-19 Healthcare Crisis and Economic Environment 

The ongoing COVID-19 healthcare crisis and public health response to contain it have triggered recessionary economic and financial market conditions durin g a large portion of the first half of 2020 . During March 2020 in an effort to lessen the impact of COVID-19 on consumers and businesses , the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate 1.5 percentage points to 0.00 to 0.25 percent and the U.S. government enacted the CARES Act, the largest economic stimulus package in the nation&#8217;s history . 

Synovus' response to the COVID-19 pandemic included measures to improve the health and safety of our team members, customers, and communities including remote work capabilities and branch service enhancements; bonus payments to hourly team members required to work on-site; pa yment deferment s on approximately $6 billion of our loan portfolio and forgiveness of NSF and monthly service charges for customers impacted. Additionally, Synovus participated in delivering PPP loans to close to 19,000 customers beginning on April 3, 2020 and funded nearly $2. 9 billion in PPP loans during the second quarter . The average PPP loan was approximately $150 thousand, and the customers that received those loans employ over 335 thousand individuals. 

In light of current economic uncertainty, Synovus has suspended its share repurchase activity beyond the $16.2 million completed during the first quarter and withdrawn 2020 guidance and long-term goals announced at the beginning of the year. Significant economic uncertainty remains, including the trajectory of the economic recovery which will be impacted by any additional government stimulus plans. 

Executive Summary 

Net income available to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2020 was $84.9 million, or $0.57 per diluted common share, a decline of 44.5% and 40.3%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2019 and adjusted net income per common share, diluted (1) was $0.23, down 76.9% compared to $1.00 for the second quarter of 2019. Net income available to common shareholders for the first six months of 2020 was $115.1 million, or $0.78 per diluted common share, a decline of 57.4% and 53.7%, respectively, compared to the first six months of 2019 and adjusted net income per common share, diluted (1) was $0.44, down 78.0% compared to $1.98 for the first six months of 2019. The year-over-year decline for all periods was driven by a significant increase in provision for credit losses following the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, as well as the impact of COVID-19, a 225 bps reduction in the federal funds rate, and PAA including loan discount accretion and deposit premium amortization that positively impacted 2019. 

Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was $749.8 million, down $44.6 million, or 5.6%, compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease in year-over-year net interest income was due to declines of $36.2 million in PAA associated with the FCB acquisition and declines in market interest rates, which were somewhat offset by higher average earning assets. Net interest margin was down 49 bps over the comparable six-month periods to 3.25%, due primarily to the decline in market interest rates in addition to declines in PAA. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up $3.3 million, or 0.9%, and net interest margin for the second quarter was 3.13%, which was down 24 bps compared to the first quarter of 2020. The sequential quarter decline in net interest margin was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of the March 2020 emergency rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, as well as excess liquidity. While the second half of the year is expected to be favorably impacted by additional PPP fee accretion as PPP loans are forgiven , net interest income and net interest margin are expected to experience downward pressure due to certain strategic balance sheet management activities which were completed late in the second quarter . 

Non-interest revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $173.5 million, up $83.7 million, or 93.2%, and year-to-date was $277.3 million, up $108.2 million, or 63.9%, compared to the same periods in 2019 and included gains on sales of investment securities available for sale of $69.4 million and $78.1 million, respectively. Adjusted non-interest revenue (1) for the second quarter of 2020 was $95.4 million, up $5.2 million, or 5.7%, and on a year-to-date basis was $194.7 million compared to $168.6 million for the first six months of 2019, up $26.1 million, or 15.5%. The increase in adjusted non-interest revenue was due primarily to strong growth in mortgage banking income with record production driven by the current rate environment. As mortgage activity normalizes, Synovus believes a reduction of adjusted non-interest revenue in the third quarter is likely before we see a return to consistent growth in fee revenue as the economy recovers. 

Non-interest expense for the second quarter of 2020 was $284.1 million, up $20.0 million, or 7.6%, and adjusted non-interest expense (1) of $276.4 million was up $19.7 million , or 7.7%, compared to the second quarter of 2019. On a year-to-date basis, non-interest expense was up $3.9 million, or 0.7%, and adjusted non-interest expense (1) was up $48.2 million, or 9.7%, compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in adjusted expense during 2020 was largely driven by mortgage production commissions, expense associated with Synovus ' internal revenue growth and efficiency initiative , "Synovus Forward", COVID -19 related expenses , and investments in talent and technology. The efficiency ratio-FTE for the first six months of 2020 was 54.47%, compared to 57.67% for the first six months of 2019. The adjusted tangible efficiency ratio (1) for the first six months of 2020 was 57.31%, up 614 bps compared to the same period a year ago. Synovus expect s expenses to decline in the second half of the year as mortgage production commissions decline with normalized mortgage activity, COVID-19 related expenses decline, and Synovus Forward initiatives are implemented . 

At June 30, 2020, total loans of $39.91 billion increased $1.66 billion, or 4.3%, sequentially, and increased $2.75 billion, or 7.4%, from December 31, 2019. The growth in total loans at June 30, 2020 included $2.71 billion in PPP loans net of unearned fees funded during the second quarter, offset partially by the transfer of certain third-party lending partnership consumer loans to held for sale during the second quarter totaling $801.0 million. We expect loans to be fairly flat over the second half of the year, as compared to balances at June 30, 2020, excluding the impact of PPP loan forgiveness. 

The ACL at June 30, 2020 totaled $649.7 million , an increase of $366.9 million from December 31, 2019 , reflecting a building of the ACL required under CECL primarily as a result of deterioration in the economic environment due to the impact of COVID-19. The ACL to loans coverage ratio was 1.63%, or 1.74%, excluding PPP loans, at June 30, 2020. Current credit metrics remain stable with NPAs at 44 bps , NPLs at 37 bps , and total past due loans at 12 bps . Year-to-date, net charge-offs are 23 bps compared to 16 bps in the prior year. Synovus does expect some pressure on credit metrics over the next few quarters, which aligns with the reserve builds in the first half of the year under the pro-cyclical nature of CECL. 

Total period-end deposits at June 30, 2020 increased $4.37 billion, or 11.0%, compared to March 31, 2020, and increased $5.79 billion, or 15.1%, compared to December 31, 2019, led by growth in non-interest bearing demand deposits. The growth in non-interest-bearing demand deposits occurred in conjunction with Synovus' PPP lending effort. Synovus also experienced broad-based growth across interest-bearing core transaction accounts compared to both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

At June 30, 2020, Synovus' CET1 ratio was 8.90%, in excess of regulatory requirements including the cap ital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The June 30, 2020 CET1 ratio improved 20 bps compared to March 31, 2020 and declined 5 bps compared to December 31, 2019. During the latter part of the second quarter of 2020, Synovus executed certain balance sheet management activities including repositioning the investment securities portfolio and transitioning certain third-party lending partnership loans to held for sale. These actions settled subsequent to quarter-end, at the margin, and are expected to provide further support to capital ratios in the third quarter of 2020. 

More detail on Synovus' financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 may be found in subsequent sections of "Item 2. &#8211; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Report. See also "Item 1A. - Risk Factors" of this Report.

Changes in Financial Condition 

During the six months ended June 30, 2020, total assets increased $5.92 billion from $48.20 billion at December 31, 2019 to $54.12 billion. Loans increased $2.75 billion, including $2.71 billion in PPP loans net of unearned fees, and loans held for sale increased $785.8 million as Synovus transitione d certain third-party lending partnership consumer loans to held for sale. Investment securities available for sale increased $418.8 million and cash and cash equivalents increased $384.3 million. Additional increases in total assets at June 30, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019, included a $1.29 billion receivable for securities available for sale sold during the quarter that will settle after quarter-end and additional investments in BOLI policies of $262.4 million. Other assets increased $351.2 million and included an increase in the fair value of derivative assets of $357.0 million. 

The growth in assets was primarily funded by increases of $5.79 billion in deposits. Other short-term borrowings declined $1.45 billion and long-term debt increased $174.0 million. Additionally, total liabilities at June 30, 2020 included an accrued liability of $923.0 million for purchases of securities available for sale that will settle after quarter-end. Other liabilities increased $315.1 million and included an increase in the fair value of derivative liabilities of $159.1 million, an increase in income taxes payable of $67.5 million, and an increase in reserves on unfunded commitments of $59.7 million. Total shareholders' equity increased $111.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020, primarily due to net income of $131.7 million, increases in unrealized gains of $50.6 million in investment securities available for sale and $86.8 million in cash flow hedges, offset partially by dividends declared on common stock of $97.2 million. 

Synovus adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 with an increase to the ALL of $83.0 million and an increase to the reserve on unfunded commitments of $27.4 million with offsetting increases in loans of $62.2 million related to acquired PCI loans and net deferred tax assets of $12.5 million and a reduction to retained earnings of $35.7 million. The ACL at June 30, 2020 was $649.7 million, an increase of $366.9 million from December 31, 2019, reflecting significant economic stress due to the COVID-19 healthcare crisis. 

The loan to deposit ratio was 90.3% at June 30, 2020, compared to 96.8% at December 31, 2019, and 95.2% at June 30, 2019.

At June 30, 2020, total loans, net of deferred fees and costs of $39.91 billion, increased $2.75 billion, or 7.4%, from December 31, 2019 led by C&#38;I growth of $3.17 billion, including $2.71 billion in PPP loans net of unearned fees, and CRE growth of $333.8 million, partially offset by a $678.0 million decline in consumer loans. We expect loans to be fairly flat over the second half of the year, as compared to balances at June 30, 2020, excluding the impact of PPP loan forgiveness. C&#38;I loans remain the largest component of our loan portfolio, representing 49.9% of total loans, while CRE and consumer loans represent 27.1% and 23.2%, respectively. Our portfolio composition is established through a comprehensive concentration management policy which sets limits for C&#38;I, CRE, and consumer loan levels as well as for sub-categories therein. 

U.S. Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) 

Synovus is participating in the Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;), which is a loan program that originated from the CARES Act and was subsequently expanded by the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (&#8220;PPPHCEA Act&#8221;) which was passed by Congress on April 23, 2020 and signed into law on April 24, 2020. PPP loans are forgivable, in whole or in part, if the proceeds are used for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP. These loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of two years, if not forgiven, in whole or in part. The loans are guaranteed by the SBA. The SBA pays the originating bank a processing fee ranging from 1% to 5%, based on the size of the loan. Synovus began accepting applications from qualified customers on April 3, 2020 and has provided nearly $2.9 billion in funding to close to 19,000 customers through the PPP as of June 30, 2020. The average PPP loan was approximately $150 thousand, and the customers that received those loans employ over 335 thousand individuals. 

Commercial Loans 

Total commercial loans (which are comprised of C&#38;I and CRE loans) at June 30, 2020 were $30.77 billion, or 77.0% of the total loan portfolio, compared to $27.26 billion, or 73.4%, at December 31, 2019 and $26.60 billion, or 73.6%, at June 30, 2019. 

At June 30, 2020, Synovus had 5 commercial loan relationships with total commitments of $100 million or more (including amounts funded), with no single relationship exceeding $150 million in commitments. 

Commercial and Industrial Loans 

The C&#38;I loan portfolio represents the largest category of Synovus' loan portfolio and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a diverse set of industries. The following table shows the composition of the C&#38;I loan portfolio aggregated by NAICS code. In accordance with Synovus' lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process which incorporates uniform underwriting standards and oversight in proportion to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. As of June 30, 2020, 80.1% (93.0% excluding PPP loans) of Synovus' C&#38;I loans are secured by real 

estate, business equipment, inventory, and other types of collateral compared to 92.6% as of December 31, 2019. C&#38;I loans grew $3.17 billion, or 18.9%, from December 31, 2019, driven primarily by $2.71 billion in PPP loans net of unearned fees at June 30, 2020.

(1) Loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total C&#38;I loans. 

At June 30, 2020, $13.14 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 32.9% of the total loan portfolio, included PPP loans of $2.71 billion net of unearned fees and represented loans originated for the purpose of financing commercial, financial, and agricultural business activities. The primary source of repayment on these loans is revenue generated from products or services offered by the business or organization. The secondary source of repayment is the collateral, which consists primarily of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, time deposits, cash surrender value of life insurance, and other business assets. 

At June 30, 2020, $6.80 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 17.0% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing owner-occupied properties. The financing of owner-occupied facilities is considered a C&#38;I loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral. This treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The secondary source of repayment on these loans is the underlying real estate. These loans are predominately secured by owner-occupied and other real estate, and to a lesser extent, other types of collateral. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

CRE loans consist primarily of income-producing investment properties loans. Additionally, CRE loans include 1-4 family properties loans as well as land and development lo ans. Total CRE loans of $10.83 billion increased $333.8 million, or 3.2%, from December 31, 2019 , driven primarily by growth in income-producing investment properties. 

Investment properties loans consist of construction and mortgage loans for income- producing properties and are primarily made to finance multi-family properties, hotels, office buildings, shopping centers, warehouses and other commercial development properties. Total investment properties loans as of June 30, 2020 were $9.45 billion, or 87.3% of the CRE loan portfolio, and increased $442.9 million, or 4.9%, from December 31, 2019 with most sub-categories experiencing growth other than shopping centers, which were slightly down. 

1-4 Family Properties Loans 

1-4 family properties loans include construction loans to home builders and commercial mortgage loans related to 1-4 family rental properties and are almost always secured by the underlying property being financed by such loans. These 

properties are primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. At June 30, 2020, 1-4 family properties loans totaled $696.8 million, or 6.4% of the CRE loan portfolio, and decreased by $83.2 million, or 10.7%, from December 31, 2019. 

Land and Development Loans 

Land and development loans include commercial and residential development as well as land acquisition loans and are secured by land held for future development, typically in excess of one year. Properties securing these loans are substantially within markets served by Synovus and loan terms generally include personal guarantees from the principals. Loans in this portfolio are underwritten based on the LTV of the collateral and the capacity of the guarantor(s). Land and development loans of $683.5 million at June 30, 2020 decreased slightly from $709.4 million at December 31, 2019. 

Consumer Loans 

The consumer loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through Synovus' banking network including first and second residential mortgages, HELOCs, and credit card loans, as well as home impro vement, student, and personal loans from third-party lending partnerships. The majority of Synovus' consumer loans are consumer mortgages and HELOCs secured by first and second liens on residential real estate primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. 

Consumer loans at June 30, 2020 of $9.25 billion decreased $678.0 million, or 6.8%, compared to December 31, 2019 primarily due to the transfer of certain third-party lending partnership loans to held for sale, partially offset by growth in consumer mortgages . Consumer mortgages grew $265.0 million, or 4.8%, from December 31, 2019 due to record production primarily resulting from the low rate environment in addition to continued successful recruiting of MLOs. HELOCs decreased $2.9 million from December 31, 2019. Credit card loans of $250.4 million at June 30, 2020 included $53.0 million of commercial credit card loans, and decreased $18.4 million from $268.8 million at December 31, 2019. Other consumer loans decreased $921.7 million, or 38.5%, from December 31, 2019 primarily due to the transfer of $801.0 million of Synovus' third-party lending partnership loans to held-for-sale . As of June 30, 2020, these partnerships had combined balances of $1.13 billion, or 2.8% of the total loan portfolio, compared to $1.98 billion, or 5.3% of the total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2019. 

Consumer loans are subject to uniform lending policies and consist primarily of loans with strong borrower credit scores. Synovus makes consumer lending decisions based upon a number of key credit risk determinants including FICO scores as well as loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios. Consumer loans are generally assigned a risk rating on a 9-point scale based on credit bureau scores, with a loan grade of 1 assigned as the lowest level of risk and a loan grade of 6 as the highest level of risk. No loans graded higher than a 6 at origination are approved for funding. At least annually, the consumer loan portfolio data is sent to a consumer credit reporting agency for a refresh of customers' credit scores so that management can evaluate ongoing consistency or negative migration in the quality of the portfolio, which impacts the ALL. Revolving lines of credit are reviewed for a material change in financial circumstances, and when appropriate, the line of credit may be suspended for further advances. FICO scores within the residential real estate portfolio have generally remained stable over the last several years. As of June 30, 2020, weighted-average FICO scores within the residential real estate portfolio based on committed balances were 789 for HELOCs and 778 for Consumer Mortgages.

Total period-end deposits at June 30, 2020 increased $4.37 billion, or 11.0%, compared to March 31, 2020, and increased $5.79 billion, or 15.1%, compared to December 31, 2019, led by growth in non-interest-bearing demand deposits. The growth in non-interest-bearing demand deposits occurred in conjunction with Synovus' PPP lending effort. Synovus also experienced broad-based growth across interest-bearing core transaction accounts compared to both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The quarterly growth in interest-bearing core transaction accounts included growth in money market accounts of $1.20 billion, NOW accounts of $439.9 million, and savings balances of $130.6 million, offset somewhat by declines in higher cost time deposits of $655.0 million. Additionally, Synovus increased funding by $302.4 million in lower priced brokered deposits, at June 30, 2020, compared to March 31, 2020. Interest-bearing deposit costs declined 45 bps during the second quarter of 2020, compared to the first quarter of 2020. 

On an average basis, the increase in total deposits was $4.41 billion, or 11.4%, compared to the first quarter of 2020. 

Non-interest Revenue 

Non-interest revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $173.5 million, up $83.7 million, or 93.2%, and year-to-date was $277.3 million, up $108.2 million, or 63.9% compared to the same periods in 2019 and included gains on sales of investment securities available for sale of $69.4 million and $78.1 million, respectively. Adjusted non-interest revenue, which excludes net investment securities gains and gain on sale/fair value increase/(decrease) of private equity investments, for the second quarter of 2020 was $95.4 million, up $5.2 million, or 5.7%, from the second quarter of 2019, and on a year-to-date basis was $194.7 million compared to $168.6 million for the first six months of 2019, up $26.1 million, or 15.5%. The increase in adjusted non-interest revenue was due primarily to strong growth in mortgage banking income with record production driven by the current rate environment. As mortgage activity normalizes, Synovus believes a reduction of adjusted non-interest revenue in the third quarter is likely before we see a return to consistent growth in fee revenue as the economy recovers. See "Table 14 - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; in this Report for applicable reconciliation to GAAP measures. 

The following table shows the principal components of non-interest revenue.

Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 compared to June 30, 2019 

Service charges on deposit accounts for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were down $6.4 million, or 29.2%, and $6.6 million, or 15.4%, respectively, due primarily to the impact of COVID-19, including fewer transactions, fee waivers, and the impact of higher average balances due to stimulus funds. Service charges on deposit accounts consist of NSF fees, account analysis fees, and all other service charges. NSF fees were down $5.1 million, or 52.8%, and $4.9 million, or 26.6%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. Account analysis fees were down $432 thousand, or 5.9%, and $451 thousand, or 3.2%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. All other service charges on deposit accounts, which consist primarily of monthly fees on retail demand deposits, saving accounts, and small business accounts, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, were down $909 thousand, or 17.9%, and $1.3 million, or 12.5%, respectively. 

Fiduciary and asset management fees are derived from providing estate administration, personal trust, corporate trust, corporate bond, investment management, and financial planning services. Fiduciary and asset management fees increased $472 thousand, or 3.3%, and $2.1 million, or 7.4%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. The increases were driven by growth in total assets under management which increased by 4.7% year-over-year to $16.56 billion. 

Card fees for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were down $2.0 million , or 17.7%, and $1.9 million , or 8.6%, respectively, due to lower transaction volume as a result of the impact of COVID-19. Card fees consist primarily of credit card interchange fees, debit card interchange fees, and merchant discounts. Card fees are reported net of certain associated expense items including customer loyalty program expenses and network expenses. 

Brokerage revenue of $10.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was essentially flat, and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was $22.4 million, up $3.0 million, or 15.2%. The year-over-year growth for the first six months of 2020 was driven by growth in assets under management, increasing contributions from 2019 new hires, and higher transaction revenue from elevated market volatility. Brokerage revenue consists primarily of brokerage commissions as well as advisory fees earned from the management of customer assets. Brokerage assets under management were $3.94 billion at June 30, 2020, an increase of 19.6% from $3.29 billion at June 30, 2019. 

Mortgage banking income was significantly higher in the first six months of 2020, with increases of $15.6 million and $22.8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. Mortgage banking income was driven by higher production and sales, including an increase in refinance volume, due primarily to a decline in long-term interest rates. Total secondary market mortgage loan production wa s $635.2 million , up $418.3 million, and $889.7 million, up $545.6 million, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively . 

Capital markets income primarily includes fee income from customer derivative transactions. Additionally, capital markets income includes fee income from capital raising investment banking transactions and foreign exchange as well as other miscellaneous income from capital market transactions. While capital markets income was $2.9 million lower for the three months ended June 30, 2020, capital markets income for the first six months of 2020 was up $3.1 million, as commercial clients locked in lower rates on borrowings late in the first quarter. 

Income from BOLI, which includes increases in the cash surrender value of policies and proceeds from insurance benefits, increased $2.6 million, or 49.8%, and $3.3 million , or 31.8%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, 

due pri marily to additional investments in BOLI policies during the first quarter of 2020. The first six months of 2020 included income on proceeds from insurance benefits of $706 thousand compared to $233 thousand in 2019. 

Investment securities gains, net, of $69.4 million and $78.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, reflected strategic repositioning of the portfolio primarily during the latter part of the second quarter of 2020. The transactions were primarily focused on agency mortgage-backed securities, but also included the disposition of Synovus' remaining $155.0 million in asset-backed securities. 

Gain on sale and increase/(decrease) in fair value of private equity investments included realized gains during the second quarter of 2020 from the sale of positions in two publicly traded equity investments, offset partially by write-downs on two smaller remaining investments. 

The main components of other non-interest revenue are fees for letters of credit and unused lines of credit, safe deposit box fees, access fees for ATM use, other service charges, income from insurance commissions, gains from sales of GGL/SBA loans, and other miscellaneous items. The first quarter of 2020 included a sale-leaseback gain of $2.4 million associated with a bank office property while the second quarter of 2020 included expense of $1.6 million related to investments in solar energy tax credit partnerships. 

Non-interest Expense 

Non-intere st expense for the second quarter of 2020 was $284.1 million, up $20.0 million, or 7.6%, compared to the second quarter of 2019 and adjusted non-interest expense of $276.4 million was up $19.7 million, or 7.7%. On a year-to-date basis, non-interest expense was up $3.9 million, or 0.7%, and adjusted non-interest expense was up $48.2 million, or 9.7%. The increase in adjusted expense during 2020 was largely driven by mortgage production commissions, expense associated with Synovus' internal revenue growth and efficiency initiatives, COVID-19 related expenses, and investments in talent and technology. The efficiency ratio-FTE for the first six months of 2020 was 54.47%, compared to 57.67% for the first six months of 2019. The adjusted tangible efficiency ratio for the first six months of 2020 was 57.31%, up 614 bps compared to the same period a year ago. Synovus expects expenses to decline in the second half of the year as mortgage production commissions decline with normalized mortgage activity, COVID-19 related expenses decline, and Synovus Forward initiatives are implemented. See "Table 14 - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; in this Report for applicable reconciliation to GAAP measures. 

The following table summarizes the components of non-interest expense.

Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 compared to June 30, 2019 

Salaries and other personnel expense increased $16.6 million, or 11.6%, and $26.8 million, or 9.5%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, due primarily to higher mortgage production-based commissions, COVID-19 related bonus payments to certain front-line employee s , and investments in talent . 

Net occupancy, equipment, and software expense increased $1.9 million, or 4.7%, and $5.7 million, or 7.3%, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, primarily due to investments in technology as well as increases in net rent expense . Synovus expects net rent expense to decline during the second half of 2020 , as compared to expense during the six months ended June 30, 2020 , as Synovus optimizes its physical space with branch and corporate real estate closures. 

Third-party processing and other services includes all third-party core operating system and processing charges as well as third-party loan servicing charges. Third-party processing expense increased $2.2 million, or 11.8%, and $6.0 million, or 16.2%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. The increase is primarily associated with loan growth from Synovus' consumer-based lending partnerships. During the second quarter of 2020, Synovus restructured certain of its third-party consumer-based lending partnership arrangements with a shift of new originations to held for sale. Thus, Synovus expects third-party loan servicing expense to decline in the second half of 2020, as compared to expense during the six months ended June 30, 2020. 

Professional fees increased $6.0 million, or 64.4%, and $10.3 million, or 65.9%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, from increases in consulting fees related to Synovus' internal revenue growth and efficiency initiative, "Synovus Forward". 

FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees were down $1.0 million and $2.5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, due primarily to strategic balance sheet management actions, aimed at reduc ing FDIC expense. 

Earnout liability fair value adjustments associated with the Global One acquisition are the result of higher than projected earnings and higher earnings estimates over the remaining contractual earnout period, reflecting the continued success of the Global One enterprise. The earnout period ends on June 30, 2021. 

In connection with the FCB acquisition, Synovus incurred merger-related expense totaling $7.4 million and $57.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, primarily related to employment compensation agreements, severance, and professional services. See "Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 - Acquisitions" in this Report for more information on the acquisition of FCB. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, Synovus recorded $2.8 million and $6.0 million, respectively, in restructuring charges related to branch closures and restructuring of corporate real estate as part of the Synovus Forward initiative . Synovus Bank operated 293 branches at June 30, 2020, compared to 298 branches at December 31, 2019 , following the closing of six branches during the first half of 2020 and opening of one new branch . During July, Synovus opened an additional branch and expects to close seven branches during the remainder of 2020. 

On February 25, 2020, Synovus terminated a $250 million long-term FHLB obligation and incurred a $1.9 m illion loss on early extinguishment of debt. 

Other operating expenses includes advertising, travel, insurance, network and communication, other taxes, subscriptions and dues, other loan and ORE expense, postage and freight, training, business development, supplies, donations, and other miscellaneous expenses. Other operating expenses were down $6.0 million and up $1.9 million, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. Advertising expense was down $3.0 million and $3.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, and travel expense was down $2.5 million and $2.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. Other operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2020 includes a $2.7 million valuation adjustment on a MPS receivable and a $2.5 million charge from termination of customer swaps. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense was $34.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, representing an effective tax rate of 20.7%, compared to income tax expense of $95.0 million f or the six months ended June 30, 2019, representing an effective tax rate of 25.6%. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2019, reflects a one-time benefit of $2.7 million for carrying back net operating loss deductions to pre-TJCA tax periods, as allowed by the CARES Act, and $2.6 million in other net discrete benefit items, including discrete items related to prior periods. Additionally, the effective tax rate in the first six months of 2019 was higher largely due to non-deductible merger-related expenses associated with the FCB acquisition. 

The effective tax rate is affected by many factors including, but not limited to, the level of pre-tax income, BOLI, tax-exempt interest, and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such as tax benefits related to share-based compensation, jurisdiction statutory tax rate changes, valuation allowance changes, income tax credits earned, and changes to unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may be impacted. 

With the exception of the net operating loss carryback deductions and certain state concessions, we do not expect the provisions of the CARES Act to have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s current tax provision. 

CREDIT QUALITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 

Credit Quality 

Synov u s continuously monitors the quality of its loan portfolio by industry, property type, geography, as well as credit quality metrics. While we expect to experience stress in the portfolio as we progress through the current economic environment, which aligns with the reserve builds in the first half of the year under the pro-cyclical nature of CECL, the credit quality of the portfolio at June 30, 2020 was generally stable, due in part to Synovus' deferral relief program offered in response to the impact of COVID-19. 

At June 30, 2020, 1 1.7 % of Synovus' loan portfolio, or $4. 67 billion, is in sectors we expect to be most sensitive to the COVID-19 pandemic. Within this group, hotels represented the largest exposure at $1.3 7 billion, followed by shopping centers (excluding those with a grocery, pharmacy, or discount store anchor) at $1.07 billion , restaurants at $787 million , retail trade (excluding gas and staples) at $724 million, arts, entertainment, and recreation at $462 million, and oil-related industries at $265 million. While our entire loan portfolio is being continuously assessed, enhanced monitoring for these sectors is ongoing . We are continuously working with these customers to evaluate how the current economic conditions are impacting, and will continue to impact, their business operations.

Non-performing Assets 

Total NPAs as a percentage of total loans, ORE, and specific other assets were 0.44% at June 30, 2020 compared to 0.37% at December 31, 2019 and 0.39% at June 30, 2019. Total NPAs were $177.7 million at June 30, 2020 compared to $137.4 million at December 31, 2019 and $139.6 million at June 30, 2019. The increase in NPLs and NPAs compared to December 31, 

2019 primarily related to the designation of a large C&#38;I relationship as non-performing in the first quarter of 2020. 

Provision for Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses of $141.9 million and $300.6 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectiv ely, resulted in the building of the ACL required under CECL primarily as a result of deterioration in the economic environment due to COVID-19 . The ACL at June 30, 2020 totaled $649.7 million consisting of an ALL of $588.6 million and reserve for unfunded commitments of $61.0 million, resulting in an ACL to loans coverage ratio of 1.63% and an ACL to NPLs ratio of 441%. Excluding PPP loans, the ACL to loans coverage ratio was 1.74%.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

Accruing TDRs were $166.5 million at June 30, 2020, compared to $133.1 million at December 31, 2019 and $126.4 million at June 30, 2019. Accruing TDRs increased $33.3 million from December 31, 2019 and $40.1 million from June 30, 2019. The primary driver of the increase in accruing TDRs compared to December 31, 2019 is a result of a large relationship being designated as an accruing TDR in the first quarter of 2020 due to interest rate and term concessions. Non-accruing TDRs were $8.5 million at June 30, 2020, compared to $17.1 million at December 31, 2019 and $12.8 million at June 30, 2019. 

Accruing TDRs are considered performing because they are performing in accordance with the re structured terms. At June 30, 2020, December 31, 2019, and June 30, 2019, approximately 99% , 99%, and 97%, respectively, of accruing TDRs were current. In addition, subsequent defaults on accruing TDRs (defaults defined as the earlier of the TDR being placed on non-accrual status or reaching 90 days past due with respect to principal and/or interest payments within twelve months of the TDR designation) have continued to remain at low levels. 

Non-TDR Modifications due to COVID-19 

Regulatory agencies have encouraged financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of COVID-19. In the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (initially issued on March 22, 2020 and revised on April 7, 2020), for example, the regulatory agencies expressed their view of loan modification programs as positive actions that may mitigate adverse effects on borrowers due to COVID-19 and their unwillingness to criticize institutions for working with borrowers in a safe and sound manner. Moreover, the Interagency Statement provided that eligible loan modifications related to COVID-19 may be accounted for under section 4013 of the CARES Act or in accordance with ASC 310-40. Section 4013 of the CARES Act allows banks to elect to not consider loan modifications related to COVID-19 that are made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2020, or 60 days after the National Emergency ends to borrowers that are current (i.e., less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019) as TDRs. The regulatory agencies further stated that performing loans granted payment deferrals due to COVID-19 are not considered past due or non-accrual. FASB confirmed the foregoing regulatory agencies' view, that such short-term modifications (e.g., six months) made on a good-faith basis in response to COVID-19 for borrowers who are current are not TDRs . Beginning in late March 2020, Synovus provided relief progr ams consisting primarily of 90-day payment deferral relief to b orrowers negatively impacted by COVID-19 and has accounted for these loan modifications in accordance with ASC 310-40. Synovus approved payment deferral relief of principal and interest to borrowers due to the effects of COVID-19 on approximately $6 billion of our loa n portfo lio. Th e deferred payments along with interest accrued during the deferral period are generally due and payable on the maturity date of the existing loan. Based on the terms of the deferral relief program which did not provide for forgiveness of interest, Synovus has recognized interest income on loans during the deferral period. As of June 30, 2020, $2.11 billion of the total loan portfolio was in a 90-day deferral status, including $3.2 million under a second 90-day deferral period. Based on reviews of customer cash flows, client surveys, and conversations and interactions with customers, Synovus preliminarily estimates that approximately 3 to 5 percent of total loans will have a second deferral granted for a 90-day deferment. As of August 4, 2020, $701.9 million of the total loan portfolio was in a 90-day deferral status, including $246.0 million under a second 90-day deferral period. The majority of second 90-day payment deferral relief provided to borrowers, as of August 4, 2020, includes deferral of scheduled principal payments only, with no deferral of interest payments. 

Capital Resources 

Synovus and Synovus Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by their primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve. Synovus and Synovus Bank measure capital adequacy using the standardized approach to Basel III. At June 30, 2020, Synovus and Synovus Bank's capital levels exceeded well-capitalized requirements currently in effect. The following table presents certain ratios used to measure Synovus and Synovus Bank's capitalization.

At June 30, 2020, Synovus' CET1 ratio was 8.90%, in excess of regulatory requirements including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The Ju ne 30, 2020 CET1 ratio improved 20 bps compared to March 31, 2020 and was 5 bps below the December 31, 2019 ratio. During the latter part of the second quarter of 2020, Synovus executed certain balance sheet management activities including repositioning the investment securities portfolio and transitioning certain third-party lending partnership loans to held for sale. These actions settled subsequent to quarter-end, at the margin, and are expected to provide further support to capital ratios in the third quarter of 2020. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 - Regulatory Capital" to the consolidated financial statements of Synovus' 2019 Form 10-K. Management reviews the Company's capital position on an on-going basis and believes, based on internal capital analyses and earnings projections, that Synovus is well positioned to meet relevant regulatory capital standards. 

As a result of the greater economic uncertainty associated with the current pandemic, Synovus suspended its share repurchase activity beyond the $16.2 million (450 thousand shares) of its common stock repurchased during the first quarter. 

On March 27, 2020, the federal banking regulators issued an interim final rule, updating CECL transition options, which allows electing banking organizations to delay an estimate of the effect of CECL on regulatory capital for up to two years, followed by a three-year phase-in transition period. Synovus adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 and the June 30, 2020 regulatory capital ratios reflect Synovus' election of the five-year transition provision. For additional information on Synovus' adoption of CECL, see "Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies" in this Report. 

Dividends 

Synovus has historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of its common stock. Management and the Board of Directors closely monitor current and projected capital levels, liquidity (including div idends from subsidiaries), financial markets and other economic trends, as well as regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends. As Synovus navigates through the current recession and regulatory guidelines , the approach to common stock dividends will be continually evaluated based on an assessment of long-term earnings, capital projections, and liquidity. 

Synovus' ability to pay dividends on its common stock and preferred stock is primarily dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from its bank and non-banking subsidiar ies, which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities. 

Synovus declared common stock dividends of $97.2 million, or $0.66 per common share, for the six months ended June 30, 2020 , up from $94.5 million, or $0.60 per common share, for the six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. In addition, Synovus declared dividends on its preferred stock of $16.6 million and $6.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers and creditors, to support asset growth, and to otherwise sustain operations of Synovus and its subsidiaries, at a reasonable cost, on a timely basis, and without adverse consequences. ALCO monitors Synovus' economic, competitive, and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk. 

In accordance with Synovus policies and regulatory guidance, ALCO evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the Company&#8217;s liquidity profile. Synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors, borrowers, and creditors on a timely basis. Liquidity is generated through various sources, including, but not limited to, maturities and repayments of loans by customers, maturities and sales of investment securities, and growth in core or wholesale deposits. Management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage customer deposit withdrawals, loan requests, and other funding demands. 

Synovus Bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Synovus Bank accesses these funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of fu nding and liquidity. Synovus Bank also has t he capacity to access funding through its membership in the FHLB system and through the Federal Reserve discount window. During the first quarter of 2020, Synovus increased its FHLB availability by over $2.0 billion through expanding pledged collateral. At June 30, 2020, based on currently pledged collateral, Synovus Bank had access to incremental FHLB funding of $ 4 . 90 billion, subject to FHLB credit policies. 

In addition to bank level liquidity management, Synovus must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, share repurchases, payment of general corporate expenses and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries. The primary source of liquidity for Synovus consists of dividends from Synovus Bank, which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the GA DBF and the Federal Reserve Bank. Synovus' ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank's future profits, asset quality, liquidit y, and overall condition. I n addition, both the GA DBF and Federal Reserve Bank may require approval to pay dividends, based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations. 

On February 12, 2020, Synovus Bank issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.289% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Bank Notes due 2023. From and including the original issue date to, but excluding, February 10, 2022, the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.289% p er annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on each February 10 and August 10, beginning on August 10, 2020. Unless redeemed, from and including February 10, 2022 to but excluding the Maturity Date, the interest rate on the Notes is computed quarterly using an interest rate based on the SOFR with a daily index maturity plus a spread of 94.5 bps per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. Synovus Bank may redeem the Notes, at its option, on February 10, 2022 (which is the date that is one year prior to the Maturity Date) upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days&#8217; prior notice given to holders of the Notes. The redemption price for any redemption is 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to but excluding the date of redemption. The Notes are not redeemable at the option or election of holders. 

On February 25, 2020, Synovus terminated a $250.0 million long-term FHLB obligation and incurred a $1.9 million loss on early extinguishment of debt. 

Synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above, including existing liquid funds on hand, are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs. However, if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate, regulatory 

capital requirements for Synovus or Synovus Bank were to increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise, or Synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels, then Synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources. See "Part I- Item 1A. Risk Factors - the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant market volatility and lower interest rates that could materially affect Synovus&#8217; results of operations and access to capital" of this Report and "Part I &#8211; Item 1A. Risk Factors - Changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity and financial results " of Synovus' 2019 Form 10-K. Furthermore, Synovus may, from time to time, take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance its existing debt, redeem its preferred stock, or strengthen its liquidity or capital position. 

Earning Assets and Sources of Funds 

Average total assets for the six months ended June 30, 2020 increased $4.54 billion, or 9.8%, to $50.78 billion as compared to $46.24 billion for the first six months of 2019. Average earning assets increased $3.78 billion, or 8.8%, in the first six months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 and represented 92.0% of average total assets at June 30, 2020, as compared to 92.8% at June 30, 2019. The increase in average earning assets primarily resulted from a $3.14 billion increase in average loans, net, which included average PPP loans of $1.11 billion (Synovus fund ed nearly $2.9 billion of PPP loans during the second quarter of 2020) as well as a $513.5 million increase in average interest-bearing funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $2.35 billion, or 7.4%, to $34.16 billion for the first six months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities resulted from a $2.60 billion increase in average money market deposits, a $706.7 million increase in average long-term debt, including $400.0 million of senior notes issued in February 2020, and a $161.6 million increase in other short-term borrowings. These increases were partially offset by a $1.62 billion, or 15.5%, decrease in average time deposits. Average non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased $1.49 billion, or 16.2%, to $10.67 billion for the first six months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, due largely to liquidity associated with PPP lending. 

Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was $749.8 million, down $44.6 million, or 5.6%, compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease in year-over-year net interest income was due to declines of $36.2 million in PAA (primarily comprised of declines of $13.5 million of loan accretion and $21.9 million of deposit premium amortization) associated with the FCB acquisition and declines in market interest rates, which were somewhat offset by higher average earning assets . Net interest margin was down 49 bps over the comparable six-month periods to 3.25%, due primarily to the decline in market intere st rates in addition to declines in PAA. For the six months ended June 30, 2020, the yield on earning assets was 4.03%, a decrease of 77 bps compared to the six months ended June 30, 2019 , while the effective cost of funds decreased 28 bps to 0.78%. The yield on loans decreased 83 bps to 4.34% while the yield on investment securities decreased 14 bps to 2.91% over the six months ended June 30, 2019. 

On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up $3.3 million, or 0.9%, and net interest margin for the second quarter was 3.13% , which was down 24 bps compared to the first quarter of 2020. The sequential quarter decline in net interest margin was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of the March 2020 emergency rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, as well as excess liquidity. The second quarter included average PPP loan balances of $2.21 billion and $9.2 million in accretion of associated PPP processing fees. For the second quarter of 2020, the yield on earning assets decreased 58 bps, while the effective cost of funds decreased 34 bps compared to the first quarter of 2020. 

While the second half of the year is expected to be favorably impacted by additional PPP fee accretion as PPP loans are forgiven, net interest income and net interest margin are expected to experience downward pressure due to certain strategic balance sheet management activities which were completed late in the second quarter. 

Quarterly yields earned on average interest-earning assets and rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities for the five most recent quarters are presented below.

Market Risk Analysis 

Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Synovus is potentially exposed. Synovus measures its sensitivity to changes in market interest rates through the use of a simulation model which incorporates all of Synovus&#8217; earning assets and liabilities. These simulations are used to determine a baseline net interest income projection and the sensitivity of the income profile based on changes in interest rates. These simula tions incorporate assumptions and factors, including, but not limited to, changes in market rates, in the size or composition of the balance sheet, and in repricing characteris tics as well as customer behaviors. This process is reviewed and updated on an on-going basis in a manner consistent with Synovus&#8217; ALCO governance framework. 

Synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income projection assuming a flat interest rate environment with the federal funds rate at the Federal Reserve&#8217;s current targeted range of 0% to 0.25% and the current prime rate of 3.25%. Synovus has modeled the impact of a gradual increase in market interest rates across the yield curve of 100 and 200 bps and a gradual decline of 25 bps to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next twelve months. The lesser decline of the downrate scenario presented was selected in light of the low absolute level of monetary policy rates and generally incorporates an assumption that rates are floored at the zero-lower-bound. Synovus' current rate risk position is considered modestly asset-sensitive and would be expected to benefit net interest income in a rising interest rate environment and reduce net interest income in a declining interest rate environment. The following table represents the estimated sensitivity of net interest income at June 30, 2020, with comparable information for December 31, 2019. 

Table 12 - Twelve Month Net Interest Income Sensitivity Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income as Compared to Unchanged Rates (for the next twelve months) Change in Short-term Interest Rates (in bps) June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 +200 1.9% 2.8% +100 1.0% 2.0% Flat &#8212;% &#8212;% -25 0.2% N/A 

The net interest income simulation model is the primary tool utilized to evaluate potential interest rate risks over a shorter-term time horizon. Synovus also evaluates potential longer-term interest rate risk through modeling and evaluation of EVE. Simulation modeling is utilized to measure the EVE and its sensitivity to immediate changes in interest rates. This EVE modeling allows Synovus to capture longer-term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet. These simulations value only the current balance sheet and do not incorporate growth assumptions used in the net interest income simulation. The EVE is the net fair value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet financial instruments derived from the present value of future cash flows discounted at current market interest rates. From this baseline valuation, Synovus evaluates changes in the value of each of these items in various interest rate scenarios to determine the net impact on the EVE. Key assumptions utilized in the model, namely loan prepayments, investment security prepayments, deposit repricing betas, and non-maturity deposit duration have a significant impact on the results of the EVE simulations. 

LIBOR 

In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021, confirming the continuation of LIBOR will not be guaranteed beyond that date. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FCA has since softened its stance on the pre-cessation end dates scheduled in 2020 and early 2021 on the issuance of instruments tied to LIBOR. The ARRC has proposed SOFR as its preferred rate as an alternative to LIBOR and has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR. The ARRC recently recommended a spread adjustment methodology for cash products based on a historical median over a five-year lookback period calculating the difference between LIBOR and SOFR. Organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. As noted within our 10-K Risk Factors, Synovus holds instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR including floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and hedges, and other financial instruments but is not able to currently predict the associated financial impacts of the transition to an alternative reference rate. Synovus has established a cross-functional LIBOR transition working group that is in the process of i) assessing the Company's current exposure to LIBOR indexed instruments and the data, systems and processes that may also be impacted; ii) establishing an implementation plan; and iii) developing a formal governance structure for the transition. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of Synovus are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as &#8220;critical accounting policies,&#8221; consisting of those related to the allowance for loan losses, fair value measurements and income taxes. In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, Synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management's practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors' Audit Committee, including the development, selection, implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on Synovus&#8217; unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. Synovus&#8217; financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies. All accounting policies described in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Synovus' 2019 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial perform ance. Excluding the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (CECL) on January 1, 2020 as disclosed in "Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies" in this Report, there have been no significant changes to the accounting policies, estimates and assumptions, or the judgments affecting the application of these estimates and assumptions from those disclosed in Synovus' 2019 Form 10-K. 

Goodwill 

G oodwill assessments are highly sensitive to economic projections and the related assumptions and estimates used by management. Synovus includes goodwill impairment analysis and reporting unit valuations as part of its critical accounting policy for fair value measurements. For additional information, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Synovus' 2019 Form 10-K and "Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" in this Report. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The measures entitled adjusted non-interest revenue; adjusted non-interest expense; adjusted total revenues; adjusted tangible efficiency ratio; adjusted net income per common share, diluted; adjusted return on average assets; adjusted return on average common equity; return on average tangible common equity, adjusted return on average tangible common equity; and tangible common equity ratio are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The most comparable GAAP measures to these measures are total non-interest revenue; total non-interest expense; total revenues; efficiency ratio-FTE; net income per common share, diluted; return on average assets; return on average common equity; and the ratio of total shareholders' equity to total assets, respectively. 

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about Synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating Synovus&#8217; operating results, financial strength, the performance of its business, and the strength of its capital position. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors, and since they are not required to be uniformly applied, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies. Adjusted total revenues and adjusted non-interest revenue are measures used by management to evaluate non-interest revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains (losses) and gains on sale and changes in fair value of private equity investments, net. Adjusted non-interest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs. Adjusted net income per common share, diluted, adjusted return on average assets, and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. Return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity are measures used by management to compare Synovus' performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization, thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently. The tangible common equity ratio is used by management to assess the strength of our capital position. The computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below.
