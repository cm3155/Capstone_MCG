 ITEM 2. &#8211; MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

In this Report, the words &#8220;Synovus,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Synovus Financial Corp. together with Synovus Bank and Synovus' other wholly-owned subsidiaries, except where the context requires otherwise. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain statements made or incorporated by reference in this Report which are not statements of historical fact, including those under &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; and elsewhere in this Report, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of, and subject to the protections of, Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to Synovus' beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, targets, expectations, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions and future performance and involve known and unknown risks, many of which are beyond Synovus' control and which may cause Synovus' actual results, performance or achievements or the financial services industry or economy generally, to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. 

All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements through Synovus' use of words such as &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;assumes,&#8221; &#8220;predicts,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;potential&#8221; and other similar words and expressions of the future or otherwise regarding the outlook for Synovus' future business and financial performance and/or the performance of the financial services industry and economy in general. Forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of Synovus' management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this document. Many of these factors are beyond Synovus' ability to control or predict. These factors include, but are not limited to: 

(1) the risks and uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our assets, business, capital and liquidity, financial condition, prospects and results of operations; 

(2) the risk that the current and any further economic downturn and contraction could have a material adverse effect on our capital, liquidity, financial condition, credit quality, results of operations and future growth, including the risk that the current economic contraction could last much longer and be much more severe if efforts to contain the pandemic are unsuccessful and restrictions on movement last longer than currently anticipated; 

(3) &#160; the risk that our asset quality may deteriorate, our allowance for credit losses may prove to be inadequate or may be negatively affected by credit risk exposures, and the risk that we may be unable to obtain full payment in respect of any loan or other receivables; 

(4) the impact of recent, proposed, or potential changes in governmental policy, laws and regulations, including recently enacted laws, regulations and guidance related to government stimulus programs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, proposed and potential changes in the regulation and taxation of banks and financial institutions, or the interpretation or application thereof and the uncertainty of future implementation and enforcement of these regulations; 

(5) changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market; 

(6) &#160; the risks that if economic conditions worsen further or regulatory capital rules are modified, we may be required to undertake initiatives to improve our capital position; 

(7) &#160; the risk that we may be required to make substantial expenditures to keep pace with regulatory initiatives and the rapid technological changes in the financial services market; 

(8) &#160; changes in the interest rate environment, including changes to the federal funds rate to include a possible negative interest rate environment, and competition in our primary market area may result in increased funding costs or reduced earning assets yields, thus further reducing margins and net interest income; 

(9) the risk that competition in the financial services industry may adversely affect our future earnings and growth; 

(10) &#160; the risk that we may not realize the expected benefits from our efficiency and growth initiatives or that we may not be able to realize those cost savings or revenue initiatives in the time period expected, which could negatively impact our future profitability; 

(11) &#160; our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks such as data security breaches, malware, "denial of service" attacks, "hacking" and identity theft, a failure of which could disrupt our business and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption or damage of our systems, increased costs, significant losses, or adverse effects to our reputation; 

(12) &#160; the risk that our current and future information technology system enhancements and operational initiatives may not be successfully implemented, which could negatively impact our operations; 

(13) &#160; our ability to attract and retain employees that are key to our strategic and growth initiatives; 

(14) &#160; the risk related to our implementation of new lines of business, new products and services or new technologies; 

(15) &#160; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends or take other capital actions; 

(16) &#160; the risk that our enterprise risk management framework, our compliance program, or our corporate governance and supervisory oversight functions may not identify or address risks adequately, which may result in unexpected losses; 

(17) &#160; risks related to our business relationships with, and reliance upon, third parties that have strategic partnerships with us or that provide key components of our business infrastructure, including the costs of services and products provided to us by third parties, and risks related to disruptions in service or financial difficulties with a third-party vendor or business relationship; 

(18) risks related to the ability of our operational framework to identify and manage risks associated with our business such as credit risk, compliance risk, reputational risk, and operational risk, including third-party business partners, as well as our relationship with third-party vendors and other service providers; 

(19) restrictions or limitations on access to funds from historical and alternative sources of liquidity could adversely affect our overall liquidity, which could restrict our ability to make payments on our obligations and our ability to support asset growth and sustain our operations and the operations of Synovus Bank; 

(20) &#160; the risk that we may be exposed to potential losses in the event of fraud and/or theft, or in the event that a third-party vendor, obligor, or business partner fails to pay amounts due to us under that relationship or under any arrangement that we enter into with them; 

(21) &#160; the risk that we could realize losses if we sell non-performing assets and the proceeds we receive are lower than the carrying value of such assets; 

(22) &#160; risks related to the fluctuation in our stock price and general volatility in the stock market; 

(23) &#160; the impact on our financial results, reputation, and business if we are unable to comply with all applicable federal and state regulations or other supervisory actions or directives and any necessary capital initiatives; 

(24) &#160; risks related to regulatory approval to take certain actions, including any dividends on our common stock or preferred stock, any repurchases of common stock or any issuance or redemption of any other regulatory capital instruments; 

(25) &#160; risks related to the continued use, availability and reliability of LIBOR and other "benchmark" rates; 

(26) &#160; the costs and effects of litigation, investigations, inquiries or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, including the costs and effects of litigation related to our participation in government stimulus programs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; 

(27) &#160; the effects of any damages to our reputation resulting from developments related to any of the items identified above; and 

(28) &#160; other factors and other information contained in this Report and in other reports and filings that we make with the SEC under the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, those found in "Part II - Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Report.

Economic Environment and Recent Events 

The ongoing COVID-19 healthcare crisis and public health response have triggered recessionary economic and financial market conditions durin g the majority of the first nine months of 2020 . During March 2020, in an effort to lessen the impact of COVID-19 on consumers and businesses , the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate 1.5 percentage points to 0.00 to 0.25 percent and the U.S. government enacted the CARES Act, the largest economic stimulus package in the nation&#8217;s history . 

Synovus responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by taking measures early, beginning in March 2020, to improve the health and safety of our customers, team members, and communities including remote work capabilities and branch service enhancements; bonus payments to hourly team members required to work on-site; pa yment deferment s on approximately $6 billion of our loan portfolio during the second quarter; and forgiveness of NSF and monthly service charges for impacted customers. Synovus participated in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and delivered close to 19,000 loans totaling nearly $2. 9 billion during the second quarter. The average PPP loan was approximately $150 thousand, and the customers that received those loans employed over 335 thousand individuals. Synovus has also participated in the Federal Reserve's Main Street Lending Program to support small and medium-sized businesses impacted by COVID-19. Additionally, although the vast majority of our customers were no longer in a payment deferment program at the end of the third quarter, we have continued to work with our borrowers who have been impacted by the pandemic. 

In September, six months after converting our branches to drive-thru and appointment-only, our retail branch network re-opened its lobbies to walk-in customers, implementing CDC safety guidelines and branch design enhancements, including plexiglass barriers, customer directional signage, mask requirements and social distancing protocols. Synovus' team members, many of whom worked remotely during the second and third quarters, re-entered the work place in a phased-in approach. This re-entry was carefully designed by team members themselves and carefully monitored through re-entry surveys and touchpoints. Synovus also provided additional benefits for team members directly impacted by the virus, including supplemental paid-time off and expanded medical benefits. In our communities, we have responded to the COVID-19 healthcare crisis and economic uncertainty with financial contributions to more than a dozen organizations for COVID-19 relief efforts, matching contributions for COVID-19 donations to the American Red Cross, and meal donations for first responders and health care worke rs. 

In light of current economic uncertainty, Synovus has suspended its share repurchase activity beyond the $16.2 million completed during the first quarter and withdrawn 2020 guidance and long-term goals announced at the beginning of the year. Significant economic uncertainty remains, including the trajectory of the economic recovery which we expect will be impacted by any additional government stimulus plans. 

Synovus is committed to addressing racial equality and social justice and has taken a number of actions during the third quarter to expand efforts to advance economic empowerment and racial equity, including establishing an internal advisory council to the CEO comprised of certain senior African American leaders, funding a $1.0 million contribution to the United Negro College Fund for the establishment of a scholarship for African American students in our footprint, providing foundational unconscious bias training to additional leaders across the footprint, and continuing to diversify an already strong and diverse Board of Directors with a new independent director. We continue to make progress toward the objectives of our CEO-sponsored inclusion and diversity initiative to improve minority representation within our team member population and female and minority representation in senior leadership, all while improving inclusiveness of all team members. 

During the third quarter, we communicated new leadership expectations and leadership training development tools for our team members. We also launched a new leadership development program for our leaders. These new expectation and training tools are intended to help team members understand what leadership looks like at the Company, and to ensure alignment of the daily work experience with the Company&#8217;s culture and values. 

Executive Summary 

Net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2020 was $83.3 million, or $0.56 per diluted common share, a decline of 35% and 32%, respectively, co mpared to the third quarter of 2019 and adjusted net income per common share, diluted (1) was $0.89, down 9% compared to $0.97 for the third quarter of 2019. Net income available to common shareholders for the first nine months of 2020 was $198.4 million, or $1.34 per diluted common share, a decline of 50% and 47%, respectively, compared to the first nine months of 2019 and adjusted net income per common share, diluted (1) was $1.32, down 55% compared to $2.96 for the first nine months of 2019. The year-over-year decline in adjusted net income per common share for all periods was impacted by deterioration in the economic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and driven by a significant increase in provision for credit losses following the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, a 225 bps reduction in the federal funds rate, and PAA including loan discount accretion and deposit premium amortization that positively impacted 2019. 

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $1.13 billion, down $69.7 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease in year-over-year net interest income was due to declines of $62.5 million 

in PAA (primarily comprised of declines of $27.0 million of loan accretion and $32.9 million of deposit premium amortization) associated with the FCB acquisition and declines in market interest rates, which were somewhat offset by higher average earning assets. Net interest margin was down 52 bps over the comparable nine-month periods to 3.20%, due primarily to the decline in market interest rates in addition to declines in PAA. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up $424 thousand and net interest margin for the third quarter was 3.10%, which was down 3 bps compared to the second quarter of 2020 . The sequential quarter decline in net interest margin was primarily driven by the impact of bond repositioning and student loan sales executed in the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by further declines in deposit pricing and favorable deposit remixing trends. We continue to expect modest downward pressure on NIM as the repricing within our fixed-rate asset portfolios is partially offset by continued declines in overall deposit costs. Excluding the potential impacts from PPP forgiveness, we expect net interest income and net interest margin to decrease modestly in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the third quarter of 2020. 

Non-interest revenue for the third quarter of 2020 was $114.4 million, up $25.7 million, or 29%, and year-to-date was $391.8 million, up $133.8 million, or 52%, compared to the same periods in 2019. Adjusted non-interest revenue (1) which excludes net investment securities gains/(losses) and gain on sale/fair value increase/(decrease) of private equity investments, for the third quarter of 2020 was $115.7 million, up $24.4 million, or 27%, from the third quarter of 2019, and on a year-to-date basis was $310.4 million compared to $259.9 million for the first nine months of 2019, up $50.5 million, or 19%. The increase in adjusted non-interest revenue was due primarily to strong growth in mortgage banking income with record production driven by the current rate environment. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see declines in mortgage revenue, as compared to the third quarter of 2020. 

Non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2020 was $316.7 million, up $40.3 million, or 15%, compared to the third quarter of 2019 and adjusted non-interest expense (1) of $268.7 million was up $10.3 million, or 4%. On a year-to-date basis, non-interest expense was up $44.2 million, or 5%, and adjusted non-interest expense (1) was up $58.5 million, or 8%. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, Synovus recognized a $44.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge representing the goodwill allocated to the Consumer Mortgage reporting unit. The increase in adjusted expense during the first nine months of 2020 was largely driven by mortgage production commissions, expense associated with Synovus' internal revenue growth and efficiency initiatives, COVID-19 related expenses, and investments in talent and technology. The efficiency ratio-FTE for the first nine months of 2020 was 57.66%, compared to 57.17% for the first nine months of 2019. The adjusted tangible efficiency ratio (1) for the first nine months of 2020 was 56.14%, up 478 bps compared to the same period a year ago. Excluding up-front expenses associated with Synovus Forward initiatives, we expect adjusted non-interest expense in the fourth quarter to be in-line with adjusted non-interest expense in the third quarter of 2020. 

At September 30, 2020, total loans, net of deferred fees and costs of $39.55 billion, increased $2.39 billion, or 6%, from December 31, 2019 led by C&#38;I growth of $3.24 billion, including $2.71 billion in PPP loans net of unearned fees, and CRE growth of $472.1 million, partially offset by a $1.26 billion decline in consumer loans. The decline in consumer loans is the result of the strategic disposition of $1.28 billion in third-party single-service consumer and non-relationship consumer mortgage loans. We expect loans, excluding the impact of PPP forgiveness, to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter, as compared to the third quarter of 2020. 

The ACL at September 30, 2020 totaled $664.6 million, an increase of $381.8 million from December 31, 2019, reflecting a building of the ACL required under CECL primarily as a result of uncertainty and deterioration in the economic environment due to COVID-19. The ACL to loans coverage ratio was 1.68%, or 1.80%, excluding PPP loans, at September 30, 2020. Current credit metrics deteriorated slightly with NPAs at 49 bps, NPLs at 43 bps, and total past due loans at 14 bps; however, we have not experienced widespread deterioration in the portfolio. Year-to-date, net charge-offs are 25 bps compared to 18 bps in the prior year. Synovus expects some pressure on credit metrics over the next few quarters, which aligns with the reserve builds to-date during 2020 under CECL. 

Total period-end deposits at September 30, 2020 increased $6.26 billion, or 16%, compared to December 31, 2019. Core transaction deposits increased $6.82 billion, or 28%, compared to December 31, 2019. The significant increase in deposit balances compared to December 31, 2019 is due largely to the current economic environment as well as government stimulus programs including deposits associated with PPP loans. 

At September 30, 2020, Synovus' CET1 ratio was 9.30%, well in excess of regulatory requirements including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The September 30, 2020 CET1 ratio improved 40 bps compared to June 30, 2020 and improved 35 bps compared to December 31, 2019 from a combination of earnings and balance sheet activities. These balance sheet activities included the settlement of our second quarter bond repositioning and our on-going efforts to manage non-relationship loan portfolios as we prioritize our balance sheet for core, client relationships. 

More detail on Synovus' financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 may be found in subsequent sections of "Item 2. &#8211; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Report. See also "Item 1A. - Risk Factors" of this Report.

Changes in Financial Condition 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, total assets increased $4.84 billion from $48.20 billion at December 31, 2019 to $53.04 billion. Loans increased $2.39 billion, including $2.71 billi on in PPP loans net of unearned fees, and l oans held for sale increased $630.0 million as Synovus transitioned certain third-party lending partnership consumer loans to held for sale. Investment securities available for sale increased $787.9 million and cash and cash equivalents increased $798.4 million. Additional increases in total assets at September 30, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019, included increases in BOLI investments of $268.4 million driven by additional investments in BOLI policies and increases in other assets of $363.1 million primarily from an increase in the fair value of derivative assets of $323.0 million. 

The growth in assets was primarily funded by increases of $6.26 billion in deposits. Other short-term borrowings declined $1.35 billion and long-term debt decreased $525.5 million. Other liabilities increased $296.4 million and included an increase in the fair value of derivative liabilities o f $142.9 million, an increase in reserves on unfunded commitments of $59.4 million, and an increase in income taxes payable of $38.4 million. Total shareholders' equity increased $122.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to net income of $223.3 million, increases in unrealized gains of $29.9 million in investment securities available for sale and $79.4 million in cash flow hedges, offset partially by dividends declared on common stock of $145.8 million and dividends declared on preferred stock of $24.9 million. 

Synovus adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 with an increase to the ALL of $83.0 million and an increase to the reserve on unfunded commitments of $27.4 million with offsetting increases in loans of $62.2 million related to acquired PCI loans and net deferred tax assets of $12.5 million and a reduction to retained earnings of $35.7 million. The ACL at September 30, 2020 was $664.6 million, an increase of $381.8 million from December 31, 2019, reflecting significant economic stress due to the COVID-19 healthcare crisis. 

The loan to deposit ratio was 88.6% at September 30, 2020, compared to 96.8% at December 31, 2019, and 97.3% at September 30, 2019.

At September 30, 2020, total loans, net of deferred fees and costs of $39.55 billion, increased $2.39 billion, or 6%, from December 31, 2019 led by C&#38;I growth of $3.24 billion, including $2.71 billion in PPP loans net of unearned fees, and CRE growth of $472.1 million, partially offset by a $1.26 billion decline in consumer loans. The decline in consumer loans is the result of the strategic disposition of $1.28 billion in third-party single-service consumer and non-relationship consumer mortgage loans. Total loans at September 30, 2020 declined $364.5 million sequentially due to strategic dispositions of $531.8 

million primarily in third-party single-service consumer loans and non-relationship consumer mortgage loans. Excluding the impact of asset dispositions and PPP loan payoffs, we had sequential quarter net loan growth of $170.3 million. We expect loans, excluding the impact of PPP forgiveness, to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter, as compared to the third quarter of 2020. C&#38;I lo ans remain the largest component of our loan portfolio, representing 50.6% of total loans, while CRE and consumer loans represent 27.7% and 22.0%, respectively. Our portfolio composition is established through a comprehensive concentration management policy which sets limits for C&#38;I, CRE, and consumer loan levels as well as for sub-categories therein. 

U.S. Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) 

Synovus is participating in the Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;), which is a loan program that originated from the CARES Act and was subsequently expanded by the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (&#8220;PPPHCEA Act&#8221;) which was passed by Congress on April 23, 2020 and signed into law on April 24, 2020. PPP loans are forgivable, in whole or in part, if the proceeds are used for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP. These loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of two years, if not forgiven, in whole or in part. The loans are guara nteed by the SBA. The SBA pays the originating bank a processing fee ranging from 1% to 5%, based on the size of the loan. Synovus began accepting applications from qualified customers on April 3, 2020 and provided nearly $2.9 billion in funding to close to 19,000 customers through the PPP during the second quarter. The average PPP loan was approximately $150 thousand, and the customers that received those loans employ over 335 thousand individuals. In October 2020, the SBA announced a streamlined forgiveness process for certain PPP loans of $50,000 or less and approximately 7% of our PPP balances fall within this threshold. 

Commercial Loans 

Total commercial loans (which are comprised of C&#38;I and CRE loans) at September 30, 2020 were $30.98 billion, or 78.3%, of the total loan portfolio, compared to $27.26 billion, or 73.4%, at December 31, 2019 and $26.73 billion, or 73.4%, at September 30, 2019. 

At September 30, 2020, Synovus had 6 commercial loan relationships with total commitments of $100 million or more (including amounts funded), with no single relationship exceeding $150 million in commitments. 

Commercial and Industrial Loans 

The C&#38;I loan portfolio represents the largest category of Synovus' loan portfolio and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a diverse set of industries. The following table shows the composition of the C&#38;I loan portfolio aggregated by NAICS code. In accordance with Synovus' lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process which incorporates uniform underwriting standards and oversight in proportion to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. As of September 30, 2020, 80.7% (93.7% excluding PPP loans) of Synovus' C&#38;I loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventory, and other types of collateral compared to 92.6% as of December 31, 2019. C&#38;I loans grew $3.24 billion, or 19.3%, from December 31, 2019, driven primarily by $2.71 billion in PPP loans net of unearned fees at September 30, 2020.

(1) Loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total C&#38;I loans. 

At September 30, 2020, $13.12 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 33.2% of the total loan portfolio (including PPP loans of $2.71 billion net of unearned fees), represented loans originated for the purpose of financing commercial, financial, and agricultural business activities. The primary source of repayment on these loans is revenue generated from products or services offered by the business or organization. The secondary source of repayment is the collateral, which consists primarily of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, time deposits, cash surrender value of life insurance, and other business assets. 

At September 30, 2020, $6.89 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 17.4% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing owner-occupied properties. The financing of owner-occupied facilities is considered a C&#38;I loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral. This treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The secondary source of repayment on these loans is the underlying real estate. These loans are predominately secured by owner-occupied and other real estate, and to a lesser extent, other types of collateral. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

CRE loans consist primarily of income-producing investment properties loans. Additionally, CRE loans include 1-4 family properties loans as well as land and development lo ans. Total CRE loans of $10.97 billion increased $472.1 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2019 , driven primarily by growth in income-producing investment properties. 

Investment properties loans consist of construction and mortgage loans for income- producing properties and are primarily made to finance multi-family properties, hotels, office buildings, shopping centers, warehouses and other commercial development properties. Total investment properties loans as of September 30, 2020 were $9.66 billion, or 88.1%, of the CRE loan portfolio, and increased $658.1 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2019 with most sub-categories experiencing growth other than shopping centers, which were down $86.6 million, or 5%, from December 31, 2019. 

1-4 Family Properties Loans 

1-4 family properties loans include construction loans to home builders and commercial mortgage loans related to 1-4 family rental properties and are almost always secured by the underlying property being financed by such loans. These properties are primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. At September 30, 2020, 1-4 family properties loans totaled $655.0 million, or 6.0% of the CRE loan portfolio, and decreased by $125.0 million, or 16%, from December 31, 2019. 

Land and Development Loans 

Land and development loans include commercial and residential development as well as land acquisition loans and are secured by land held for future development, typically in excess of one year. Properties securing these loans are substantially within markets served by Synovus and loan terms generally include personal guarantees from the principals. Loans in this portfolio are underwritten based on the LTV of the collateral and the capacity of the guarantor(s). Land and development loans of $648.4 million at September 30, 2020 decreased $61.1 million, or 9%, from $709.4 million at December 31, 2019. 

Consumer Loans 

The consumer loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through Synovus' banking network including first and second residential mortgages, HELOCs, and credit card loans, as well as home impro vement, student, and personal loans from third-party lending partnerships. The majority of Synovus' consumer loans are consumer mortgages and HELOCs secured by first and second liens on residential real estate primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. 

Consumer loans at September 30, 2020 of $8.67 billion decreased $1.26 billion, or 13%, compared to December 31, 2019 due to the strategic disposition of certain third-party single-service consumer loans and non-relationship consumer mortgage loans. Consumer mortgages grew $112.2 million, or 2.0%, from December 31, 2019 due to record production primarily resulting from the low rate environment in addition to continued successful recruiting of MLOs somewhat offset by the strategic sale of $180.2 million in non-relationship consumer mortgage loans. HELOCs decreased $98.0 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2019. Credit card loans of $264.8 million at September 30, 2020 included $56.6 million of commercial credit card loans, and decreased $4.0 million from $268.8 million at December 31, 2019. Other consumer loans decreased $1.27 billion, or 53%, from December 31, 2019 primarily due to the strategic disposition of certain third-party single-service consumer loans totaling $1.10 billion. As of September 30, 2020, third-party lending partnerships had combined balances of $714.3 million, or 1.8%, of the total loan portfolio, compared to $1.98 billion, or 5.3%, of the total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2019. 

Consumer loans are subject to uniform lending policies and consist primarily of loans with strong borrower credit scores. Synovus makes consumer lending decisions based upon a number of key credit risk determinants including FICO scores as well as loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios. Consumer loans are generally assigned a risk rating on a 9-point scale based on credit bureau scores, with a loan grade of 1 assigned as the lowest level of risk and a loan grade of 6 as the highest level of risk. No loans graded higher than a 6 at origination are approved for funding. At least annually, the consumer loan portfolio data is sent to a consumer credit reporting agency for a refresh of customers' credit scores so that management can evaluate ongoing consistency or negative migration in the quality of the portfolio, which impacts the ALL. Revolving lines of credit are reviewed for a material change in financial circumstances, and when appropriate, the line of credit may be suspended for further advances. FICO scores within the residential real estate portfolio have generally remained stable over the last several years. As of September 30, 2020, weighted-average FICO scores within the residential real estate portfolio based on committed balances were 790 for HELOCs and 778 for Consumer Mortgages.

(4) Core transaction deposits consist of non-interest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, money market accounts, and savings deposits excluding public funds and brokered deposits. 

Total period-end deposits at September 30, 2020 increased $471.3 million, or 1%, compared to June 30, 2020, and increased $6.26 billion, or 16%, compared to December 31, 2019. Core transaction deposits increased $1.56 billion, or 5%, sequentially, and increased $6.82 billion, or 28%, compared to December 31, 2019 . The significant increase in deposit balances compared to December 31, 2019 is due largely to the current uncertain economic environment as well as government stimulus programs including deposits associated with PPP loans. The sequential quarter growth in lower cost core transaction accounts of $1.56 billion included growth in non-interest-bearing demand deposits of $299.1 million, money market accounts of $984.1 million, NOW accounts of $233.9 million, and savings balances of $45.9 million, and more than offset strategic declines of $1.16 billion and $381.0 million in time deposits and brokered deposits, respectively. Total deposit cost declined 14 bps during the third quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of 2020 due to pricing diligence and product remixing. 

On an average basis, the increase in total deposits was $1.24 billion, or 3%, compared to the second quarter of 2020. 

Non-interest Revenue 

Non-interest revenue for the third quarter of 2020 was $114.4 million, up $25.7 million, or 29%, and year-to-date was $391.8 million, up $133.8 million, or 52%, compared to the same periods in 2019 . Adjusted non-interest revenue, which excludes net investment securities gains/(losses) and gain on sale/fair value increase/(decrease) of private equity investments, for the third quarter of 2020 was $115.7 million, up $24.4 million, or 27%, from the third quarter of 2019, and on a year-to-date basis was $310.4 million compared to $259.9 million for the first nine months of 2019, up $50.5 million, or 19% . The increase in adjusted non-interest revenue was due primarily to strong growth in mortgage banking income with record production driven by the current rate environment. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see declines in mortgage revenue, as compared to the third quarter of 2020.

The following table shows the principal components of non-interest revenue.

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 compared to September 30, 2019 

Service charges on deposit accounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 were down $5.1 million, or 22%, and $11.7 million, or 18%, respectively, due primarily to the impact of COVID-19, including fewer transactions and the impact of higher average balances due to stimulus funds. Service charges on deposit accounts consist of NSF fees, account analysis fees, and all other service charges. NSF fees were dow n $4.4 million, or 43%, and $9.3 million, or 33%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. Account analysis fees were up $168 thousand, or 2%, and down $283 thousand, or 1%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. All other service charges on deposit accounts, which consist primarily of monthly fees on retail demand deposits, saving accounts, and small business accounts, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, were down $882 thousand, or 16%, and $2.2 million, or 14%, respectively. 

Fiduciary and asset management fees are derived from providing estate administration, personal trust, corporate trust, corporate bond, investment management, and financial planning services. Fiduciary and asset management fees increased $1.2 million, or 8%, and $3.3 million, or 8%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectivel y. The increases were driven by growth in total assets under management which increased by 8% year-over-year to $17.54 billion. 

Card fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 were down $1.5 million, or 12%, and $3.4 million, or 10%, respectively, due to lower transaction volume as a result of the impact of COVID-19. Card fees consist primarily of credit card interchange fees, debit card interchange fees, and merchant discounts. Card fees are reported net of certain associated expense items including customer loyalty program expenses and network expenses. 

Brokerage revenue of $10.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was down $466 thousand, or 4%, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $33.0 million, up $2.5 million, or 8%. The year-over-year growth was driven by growth in assets under management, increasing contributions from 2019 new hires, and higher transaction revenue from elevated market volatility. Brokerage revenue consists primarily of brokerage commissions as well as advisory fees earned from the management of customer assets. 

Mortgage banking income was significantly higher in the first nine months of 2020, with increases of $20.9 million and $43.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. Mortgage banking income was driven by higher production and sales, including an increase in refinance volume, due primarily to a decline in long-term interest rates. Total secondary market mortgage loan production was $653.9 million, up $371.3 million, and $1.54 billion, up $916.9 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. 

Capital markets income primarily includes fee income from customer deri vative transactions. Additionally, capital markets income includes fee income from capital raising investment banking transactions and foreign exchange as well as other miscellaneous income from capital market transactions. While capital markets income was $1.7 million lower for the three months ended September 30, 2020 , capital markets income for the first nine months of 2020 was up $1.4 million, as commercial clients locked in lower rates on borrowings late in the first quarter. 

Income from BOLI, which includes increases in the cash surrender value of policies and proceeds from insurance benefits, increased $2.6 million, or 51%, and $6.0 million , or 38%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, 

respectively, due primarily to additional investments in BOLI policies during the first quarter of 2020. The first nine months of 2020 included income on proceeds from insurance benefits of $1.3 million compared to $233 thousand in 2019. 

Investment securities gains (losses), net, of $(1.6) million and $76.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, reflected strategic repositioning of the portfolio primarily during the latter part of the second quarter of 2020. The transactions were primarily focused on agency mortgage-backed securities, but also included the disposition of Synovus' remaining $155.0 million in asset-backed securities. 

Gain on sale and increase/(decrease) in fair value of private equity investments included realized gains during the second quarter of 2020 from the sale of positions in two publicly traded equity investments, offset partially by write-downs on two smaller remaining investments. 

The main components of other non-interest revenue are fees for letters of credit and unused lines of credit, safe deposit box fees, access fees for ATM use, other service charges, income from insurance commissions, gains from sales of GGL/SBA loans, and other miscellaneous ite ms. Insurance commission revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 was up $1.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively. The third quarter of 2020 included a $2.8 million favorable valuation adjustment for tax credit investments and a gain of $2.5 million from the sale of non-relationship mortgage loans. Additionally, the first quarter of 2020 included a sale-leaseback gain of $2.4 million associated with a bank office property while the second quarter of 2020 included an unfavorable valuation adjustment of $1.6 million for tax credit investments. 

Non-interest Expense 

Non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2020 was $316.7 million, up $40.3 million, or 15%, compared to the third quarter of 2019 and adjusted non-interest expense of $268.7 million was up $10.3 million, or 4%. On a year-to-date basis, non-interest expense was up $44.2 million, or 5%, and adjusted non-interest expense was up $58.5 million, or 8%. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, Synovus recognized a $44.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge representing the goodwill allocated to the Consumer Mortgage reporting un it. The increase in adjusted expense during the first nine months of 2020 was largely driven by mortgage production commissions, expense associated with Synovus' internal revenue growth and efficiency initiatives, COVID-19 related expenses, and investments in talent and technology. The efficiency ratio-FTE for the first nine months of 2020 was 57.66%, compared to 57.17% for the first nine months of 2019. The adjusted tangible efficiency ratio for the first nine months of 2020 was 56.14%, up 478 bps compared to the same period a year ago. Excluding expenses associated with Synovus Forward initiatives, we expect adjusted non-interest expense in the fourth quarter to be in-line with adjusted non-interest expense in the third quarter of 2020. See "Table 14 - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; in this Report for applicable reconciliation to GAAP measures. 

The following table summarizes the components of non-interest expense.

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 compared to September 30, 2019 

Salaries and other personnel expense increased $12.5 million, or 9%, and $39.3 million, or 9%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, due primarily to higher mortgage production-based commissions, COVID-19 related bonus payments to certain front-line employee s , and investments in talent. Total headcount of 5,347 declined 81 from June 30, 2020 and 57 from September 30, 2019. 

Net occupancy, equipment, and software expense increased $537 thousand, or 1%, and $6.2 million, or 5%, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, primarily due to investments in technology as well as increases in net rent expense. Synovus expects net rent expense to decline during the fourth quarter of 2020, as compared to expense during the third quarter of 2020, as Synovus optimizes its physical space with branch and corporate real estate closures. 

Third-party processing and other services includes all third-party core operating system and processing charges as well as third-party loan servicing charges. Third-party processing expense increased $2.1 million, or 11%, and $8.1 million, or 15%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. The increase is primarily associated with loan growth from Synovus' consumer-based lending partnerships. However, during the second quarter of 2020, Synovus restructured certain of its third-party consumer-based lending partnership arrangements with a shift of new originations to held for sale and thereby reducing future third-party loan servicing expense. 

Professional fees increased $3.7 million, or 38%, and $14.0 million, or 55%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, from increases in consulting fees related to Synovus' internal revenue growth and efficiency initiative, "Synovus Forward". 

FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees were down $449 thousand and $3.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, due primarily to strategic balance sheet management actions, aimed at reducing FDIC expense. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2020, Synovus recognized a $44.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge representing the goodwill allocated to the Consumer Mortgage reporting unit resulting from a combination of factors including the extended duration of lower market valuations, high volumes in refinance activity that have reduced mortgage yields, and the clarity around longer term policy actions designed to keep interest rates low. 

Earnout liability fair value adjustments associated with the Global One acquisition are the result of higher than projected earnings and higher earnings estimates over the remaining contractual earnout period, reflecting the continued success of the Global One enterprise. The earnout period ends on June 30, 2021. 

In connection with the FCB acquisition, Synovus incurred merger-related expense totaling $353 thousand and $57.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, primarily related to employment compensation agreements, severance, and professional services. See "Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 - Acquisitions" in this Report for more information on the acquisition of FCB. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, Synovus recorded $2.9 million and $8.9 million, respectively, in restructuring charges primarily related to branch closures and restructuring of corporate real estate as part of the Synovus Forward initiative. Synovus Bank operated 292 branches at September 30, 2020 and at November 2, 2020 Synovus Bank operated 288 branches, compared to 298 branches at December 31, 2019, following the closing of 12 branches and opening of two new branches during 2020. See "Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12 - Subsequent Events", regarding Synovus' voluntary early retirement program and associated one-time termination benefit restructuring charge of approximately $14 million recorded in October, 2020. 

On February 25, 2020, Synovus terminated a $250.0 million long-term FHLB obligation and incurred a $1.9 million loss on early extinguishment of debt and on September 15, 2020, Synovus terminated a $500 million long-term FHLB obligation and incurred a $154 thousand loss on early extinguishment of debt. 

Other operating expenses includes advertising, travel, insurance, network and communication, other taxes, subscriptions and dues, other loan and ORE expense, postage and freight, training, business development, supplies, donations, and other miscellaneous expenses. Other operating expenses were down $7.8 million and $5.4 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. Advertising expense was down $3.3 million and $6.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, and travel expense was down $1.8 million and $4.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. Other operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 includes a $2.7 million valuation adjustment on a MPS receivable, a $2.5 million charge from termination of customer swaps, and a $1.0 million donation to the United Negro College Fund. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense was $39.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, representing an effective tax rate of 30.3%, compared to income tax expense of $51.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, representing an effective tax rate of 27 .4%. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019, is primarily related to a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $44.9 million recorded during the third quarter of 2020. 

Income tax expense was $74.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, representing an effective tax rate of 25.0%, compared to income tax expense of $146.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, representing an effective tax rate of 26.2%. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 includes the impact of the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge recognized during the third quarter of 2020, partly offset by discrete tax benefits including a $2.7 million benefit for carrying back net operating loss deductions to pre-TJCA tax periods, as allowed by the CARES Act, a $1.4 million benefit for a state tax rate change, and $2.3 million in other net discrete benefit items, including discrete items related to prior periods. The effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2019 was higher largely due to nondeductible merger-related expenses associated with the FCB acquisition. 

Synovus&#8217; effective tax rate considers many factors including, but not limited to, the level of pre-tax income, BOLI, tax-exempt interest, certain income tax credits, and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such as tax benefits related to share-based compensation, jurisdiction statutory tax rate changes, valuation allowance changes, and changes to unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may be impacted. 

With the exception of the net operating loss carryback deductions and certain state concessions, we do not expect the provisions of the CARES Act to have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s current tax provision. With regard to the CARES Act payroll tax deferrals, Synovus estimates the payment of approximately $16.6 million of employer payroll taxes otherwise due in 2020 will be delayed, with 50% due by December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% by December 31, 2022. 

CREDIT QUALITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 

Credit Quality 

Synovus continuously monitors the quality of its loan portfolio by industry, property type, geography, as well as credit quality metrics. Credit metrics deteriorated slightly during the third quarter of 2020 with slight increases in NPAs, NPLs, and past dues from June 30, 2020; however, these increases were primarily isolated to specific credits, and we have not experienced widespread deterioration in the portfolio. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2020, loan downgrades to Special Mention and Substandard totaled $731.0 million and $137.5 million, respectively, primarily due to downgrades of $600.0 million in the hotel portfolio, one of the hardest hit industries. Synovus' hotel loan portfolio totaled $1.41 billion at September 30, 2020 compared to $1.36 billion at June 30, 2020. 

Synovus does expect some pressure on credit metrics over the next few quarters, which aligns with the reserve builds to-date during 2020 under CECL. We are continuously working with our customers to evaluate how the current economic conditions are impacting, and will continue to impact, their business operations. 

The table below includes selected credit quality metrics.

* Prior to CECL implementation on January 1, 2020, the provision for unfunded commitments was reflected within other non-interest expense. 

Non-performing Assets 

Total NPAs as a percentage of total loans, ORE, and specific other assets were 0.49% at September 30, 2020 compared to 0.37% at December 31, 2019 and 0.42% at September 30, 2019. Total NPAs were $192.1 million at September 30, 2020 compared to $137.4 million at December 31, 2019 and $151.3 million at September 30, 2019. The increase in NPLs and NPAs compared to December 31, 2019 was mostly isolated to a few larger commercial relationships being designated as non-performing. 

Provision for Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses (which includes the provision for loan losses and unfunded commitments) of $43.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 included net charge-offs of $28.5 million and the impact of downgrades largely concentrated in the hotel portfolio, which were mostly offset by improvement in the economic forecast which included adjustments for the estimated impact of currently enacted government stimulus plans, as well as reserve releases from loan dispositions. Provision for credit losses of $344.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, resulted in the building of the ACL required under CECL primarily as a result of uncertainty and deterioration in the economic environment due to the impact of COVID-19. The amount of provision for credit losses going forward will continue to fluctuate based on a number of factors including economic outlook, loan growth, loan mix, risk grade migration, as well as the timing and impact of any future government stimulus plans. The ACL at September 30, 2020 totaled $664.6 million consisting of an ALL of $603.8 million and reserve for unfunded commitments of $60.8 million, resulting in an ACL to loans coverage ratio of 1.68% and an ACL to NPLs ratio of 394%. Excluding PPP loans, the ACL to loans coverage ratio was 1.80%.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

Accruing TDRs were $163.5 million at September 30, 2020, compared to $133.1 million at December 31, 2019 and $130.0 million at September 30, 2019. Accruing TDRs increased $30.4 million from December 31, 2019 and $33.5 million from September 30, 2019. The primary driver of the increase in accruing TDRs compared to December 31, 2019 is a result of a large relationship being designated as an accruing TDR in the first quarter of 2020 due to interest rate and term concessions. Non-accruing TDRs were $4.6 million at September 30, 2020, compared to $17.1 million at December 31, 2019 and $13.6 million at September 30, 2019. 

Accruing TDRs are considered performing because they are performing in accordance with the re structured terms. At September 30, 2020, December 31, 2019, and September 30, 2019, approximately 99% , 99%, and 98%, respectively, of accruing TDRs were current. In addition, subsequent defaults on accruing TDRs (defaults defined as the earlier of the TDR being placed on non-accrual status or reaching 90 days past due with respect to principal and/or interest payments within twelve months of the TDR designation) have continued to remain at low levels. 

Non-TDR Modifications due to COVID-19 

Regulatory agencies encouraged financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of COVID-19. In the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (initially issued on March 22, 2020 and revised on April 7, 2020), for example, the regulatory agencies expressed their view of loan modification programs as positive actions that may mitigate adverse effects on borrowers due to COVID-19 and their unwillingness to criticize institutions for working with borrowers in a safe and sound manner. Moreover, the Interagency Statement provided that eligible loan modifications related to COVID-19 may be accounted for under section 4013 of the CARES Act or in accordance with ASC 310-40. Section 4013 of the CARES Act allows banks to elect to not consider loan modifications related to COVID-19 that are made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2020, or 60 days after the National Emergency ends to borrowers that are current (i.e., less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019) as TDRs. The regulatory agencies further stated that performing loans granted payment deferrals due to COVID-19 are not considered past due or non-accrual. FASB confirmed the foregoing regulatory agencies' view, that such short-term modifications (e.g., six months) made on a good-faith basis in response to COVID-19 for borrowers who are current are not TDRs . Beginning in late March 2020, Synovus provided rel ief programs consisting primarily of 90-day payment deferral relief to borrowers negatively impacted by COVID-19 and has primarily accounted for these loan modifications in accordance with ASC 310-40 . During the third quarter, upon evaluation of facts and circumstances, the CARES Act was elected for certain loan modifications that met the criteria of section 4013 of the CARES Act. The deferred payments along with interest accrued during the deferral period are generally due and payable on the maturity date of the existing loan. Based on the terms of the deferral r elief program which did not provide for forgiveness of interest, Synovus has recognized interest income on loans during the deferral period. As of September 30, 2020, approximately 1% of the total loan portfolio was in a P&#38;I deferral status, down significantly from approximately 15% of our loan portfolio that had been granted P&#38;I deferral through our relief programs as of the filing of our first quarter 2020 10-Q. In addition to our 

P&#38;I deferment program, we have also provided borrowers who have been impacted during the current crisis with other modifications such as interest only relief or amortization extensions on approximately 2% of total loans. 

Capital Resources 

Synovus and Synovus Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by their primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve. Synovus and Synovus Bank measure capital adequacy using the standardized approach to Basel III. At September 30, 2020, Synovus and Synovus Bank's capital levels exceeded well-capitalized requirements currently in effect. The following table presents certain ratios used to measure Synovus and Synovus Bank's capitalization.

At September 30, 2020, Synovus' CET1 ratio increased to 9.30%, well in excess of regulatory requirements including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5 %. The September 30, 2020 CET1 ratio improved 40 bps compared to June 30, 2020 and 35 bps compared to December 31, 2019 from a combination of earnings and balance sheet activities. These balance sheet activities included the settlement of our second quarter bond repositioning and our on-going efforts to manage non-relationship loan portfolios as we prioritize our balance sheet for core, client relationships. We remain focused on supporting our overall capital position and are targeting the higher end of our CET1 operating range of 9.0% to 9.5%, given the heightened uncertainty in the current economic environment. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 - Regulatory Capital" to the consolidated financial statements of Synovus' 2019 Form 10-K. Management reviews the Company's capital position on an on-going basis and believes, based on internal capital analyses and earnings projections, that Synovus is well positioned to meet relevant regulatory capital standards. 

As a result of the greater economic uncertainty associated with the current pandemic, Synovus suspended its share repurchase activity beyond the $16.2 million (450 thousand shares) of its common stock repurchased during the first quarter. 

On August 26, 2020, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule (followin g an interim final rule issued on March 27, 2020) that allows electing banking organizations that adopt CECL during 2020 to mitigate the estimated effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in transition period. Synovus adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 and the September 30, 2020 regulatory capital ratios reflect Synovus' election of the five-year transition provision. For 

additional information on Synovus' adoption of CECL, see "Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies" in this Report. 

Dividends 

Synovus has historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of its common stock. Management and the Board of Directors closely monitor current and projected capital levels, liquidity (including div idends from subsidiaries), financial markets and other economic trends, as well as regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends. As Synovus navigates through the current recession and regulatory guidelines , the approach to common stock dividends will be continually evaluated based on an assessment of long-term earnings, capital projections, and liquidity. 

Synovus' ability to pay dividends on its common stock and preferred stock is primarily dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from its bank and non-banking subsidiar ies, which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities. 

Synovus declared common stock dividends of $145.8 million, or $0.99 per common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 , up from $138.9 million, or $0.90 per common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. In addition, Synovus declared dividends on its preferred stock of $24.9 million and $14.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers and creditors, to support asset growth, and to otherwise sustain operations of Synovus and its subsidiaries, at a reasonable cost, on a timely basis, and without adverse consequences. ALCO monitors Synovus' economic, competitive, and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk. 

In accordance with Synovus policies and regulatory guidance, ALCO evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the Company&#8217;s liquidity profile. Synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors, borrowers, and creditors on a timely basis. Liquidity is generated through various sources, including, but not limited to, maturities and repayments of loans by customers, maturities and sales of investment securities, and growth in core or wholesale deposits. Management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage customer deposit withdrawals, loan requests, and other funding demands. 

Synovus Bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Synovus Bank accesses these funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of fu nding and liquidity. Synovus Bank also has t he capacity to access funding through its membership in the FHLB system and through the Federal Reserve discount window. During the first quarter of 2020, Synovus increased its FHLB availability by over $2.0 billion through expanding pledged collateral. At September 30, 2020, based on currently pledged collateral, Synovus Bank had access to incremental FHLB funding of $4.57 billion, subject to FHLB credit policies. 

In addition to bank level liquidity management, Synovus must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, share repurchases, payment of general corporate expenses and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries. The primary source of liquidity for Synovus consists of dividends from Synovus Bank, which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the GA DBF and the Federal Reserve Bank. Synovus' ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank's future profits, asset quality, liquidit y, and overall condition. I n addition, both the GA DBF and Federal Reserve Bank may require approval to pay dividends, based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations. 

On February 12, 2020, Synovus Bank issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.289% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Bank Notes due 2023. From and including the original issue date to, but excluding, February 10, 2022, the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.289% p er annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on each February 10 and August 10, beginning on August 10, 2020. Unless redeemed, from and including February 10, 2022 to but excluding the Maturity Date, the interest rate on the Notes is computed quarterly using an interest rate based on the SOFR with a daily index maturity plus a spread of 94.5 bps per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. Synovus Bank may redeem the Notes, at its option, on February 10, 2022 (which is the date that is one year prior to the Maturity Date) upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days&#8217; prior notice given to holders of the Notes. The redemption price for any redemption is 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to but excluding the date of redemption. The Notes are not redeemable at the option or election of holders. 

On February 25, 2020, Synovus terminated a $250.0 million long-term FHLB obligation and incurred a $1.9 million loss on early extinguishment of debt and on September 15, 2020, Synovus terminated a $500 million long-term FHLB obligation and incurred a $154 thousand loss on early extinguishment of debt. 

Synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above, including existing liquid funds on hand, are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs. However, if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate, regulatory capital requirements for Synovus or Synovus Bank were to increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise, or Synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels, then Synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources. See "Part I- Item 1A. Risk Factors - the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant market volatility and lower interest rates that could materially affect Synovus&#8217; results of operations and access to capital" of this Report and "Part I &#8211; Item 1A. Risk Factors - Changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity and financial results " of Synovus' 2019 Form 10-K. Furthermore, Synovus may, from time to time, take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance its existing debt, redeem its preferred stock, or strengthen its liquidity or capital position. 

Earning Assets and Sources of Funds 

Average total assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 increased $5.00 billion, or 11%, to $51.57 billion as compared to $46.57 billion for the first nine months of 2019. Average earning assets increased $4.18 billion, or 10%, in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 and represented 91.8% of average total assets at September 30, 2020, as compared to 92.7% at September 30, 2019. The increase in average earning assets primarily resulted from a $3.17 billion, or 9%, increase in average loans, net, which included average PPP loans of $1.64 bill ion, as well as a $578.3 million increase in average interest-bearing funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank and a $287.4 million increase in loans held for sale. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $2.19 billion, or 7%, to $34.11 billion for the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities resulted from a $3.08 billion, or 28%, increase in average money market deposits (includes an increase of $863.7 million in other brokered deposits), a $879.2 million increase in average interest-bearing demand deposits, and a $451.8 million increase in average long-term debt, including $400.0 million of senior notes issued in February 2020. These increases were partially offset by a $1.98 billion, or 19%, decrease in average time deposits (includes an increase of $ 230.2 millio n in brokered time deposits) and a $316.6 million decrease in other short-term borrowings. Average non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased $2.13 billion, or 23%, to $11.37 billion for the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, due largely to liquidity associated with PPP lending. 

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $1.13 billion, down $69.7 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease in year-over-year net interest income was due to declines of $62.5 million in PAA (primarily comprised of declines of $27.0 million of loan accretion and $32.9 million of deposit premium amortization) associated with the FCB acquisition and declines in market interest rates, which were somewhat offset by higher average earning assets. Net interest margin was down 52 bps over the comparable nine-month periods to 3.20%, due primarily to the decline in market interest rates in addition to declines in PAA. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the yield on earning assets was 3.88%, a decrease of 91 bps compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019, while the effective cost of funds decreased 39 bps to 0.68%. The yield on loans decreased 96 bps to 4.20% while the yield on investment securities decreased 36 bps to 2.72% over the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up $424 thousand and net interest margin for the third quarter was 3.10%, which was down 3 bps compared to the second quarter of 2020 . The sequential quarter decline in net interest margin was primarily driven by the impact of bond repositioning and student loan sales executed in the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by further declines in deposit pricing and favorable deposit remixing trends. The third quarter included average PPP loan balances of $2.70 billion versus $2.21 billion in the second quarter and $11.9 million in accretion of associated PPP processing fees versus $9.2 million in the second quarter. For the third quarter of 2020, the yield on earning assets decreased 17 bps, while the effective cost of funds decreased 14 bps compared to the second quarter of 2020. 

We continue to expect modest downward pressure on NIM as the repricing within our fixed-rate asset portfolios is partially offset by continued declines in overall deposit costs. Excluding the potential impacts from PPP forgiveness, we expect net interest income and net interest margin to decrease modestly in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the third quarter of 2020. 

Quarterly yields earned on average interest-earning assets and rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities for the five most recent quarters are presented below.

Market Risk Analysis 

Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Synovus is potentially exposed. Synovus measures its sensitivity to changes in market interest rates through the use of a simulation model which incorporates all of Synovus&#8217; earning assets and liabilities. These simulations are used to determine a baseline net interest income projection and the sensitivity of the income profile based on changes in interest rates. These simula tions incorporate assumptions and factors, including, but not limited to, changes in market rates, in the size or composition of the balance sheet, and in repricing characteris tics as well as customer behaviors. This process is reviewed and updated on an on-going basis in a manner consistent with Synovus&#8217; ALCO governance framework. 

Synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income projection assuming a flat interest rate environment with the federal funds rate at the Federal Reserve&#8217;s current targeted range of 0% to 0.25% and the current prime rate of 3.25%. Synovus has modeled the impact of a gradual increase in market interest rates across the yield curve of 100 and 200 bps and a gradual decline of 25 bps to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next twelve months. The lesser decline of the downrate scenario presented was selected in light of the low absolute level of monetary policy rates and generally incorporates an assumption that rates are floored at the zero-lower-bound. Synovus' current rate risk position is considered asset-sensitive and would be expected to benefit net interest income in a rising interest rate environment and reduce net interest income in a declining interest rate environment. The following table represents the estimated sensitivity of net interest income at September 30, 2020, with comparable information for December 31, 2019. 

Table 12 - Twelve Month Net Interest Income Sensitivity Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income as Compared to Unchanged Rates (for the next twelve months) Change in Short-term Interest Rates (in bps) September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 +200 2.4% 2.8% +100 1.0% 2.0% Flat &#8212;% &#8212;% -25 (0.2)% N/A 

The net interest income simulation model is the primary tool utilized to evaluate potential interest rate risks over a shorter-term time horizon. Synovus also evaluates potential longer-term interest rate risk through modeling and evaluation of the sensitivity of the Company's Economic Value of Equity (EVE). The EVE measurement process estimates the net fair value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet financial instruments under various interest rate scenarios. Management uses EVE sensitivity analyses as an additional means of measuring interest rate risk and incorporates this form of analysis within its governance and limits framework. 

LIBOR 

In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021, confirming the continuation of LIBOR will not be guaranteed beyond that date. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FCA has since softened its stance on the pre-cessation end dates scheduled in 2020 and early 2021 on the issuance of instruments tied to LIBOR. The ARRC has proposed SOFR as its preferred rate as an alternative to LIBOR and has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR. The ISDA recently recommended a spread adjustment methodology for derivative products based on historical differences between LIBOR and SOFR. Organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. As noted within our 10-K Risk Factors, Synovus holds instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR including floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and hedges, and other financial instruments but is not able to currently predict the associated financial impacts of the transition to an alternative reference rate. Synovus has established a cross-functional LIBOR transition working group that is in the process of i) assessing the Company's current exposure to LIBOR indexed instruments and the data, systems and processes that may also be impacted; ii) establishing an implementation plan; and iii) developing a formal governance structure for the transition. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of Synovus are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as &#8220;critical accounting policies,&#8221; consisting of those related to the allowance for loan losses, fair value measurements and income taxes. In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, Synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management's practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors' Audit Committee, including the development, selection, implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on Synovus&#8217; unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. Synovus&#8217; financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies. All accounting policies described in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Synovus' 2019 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial perform ance. Excluding the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (CECL) on January 1, 2020 as disclosed in "Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies" in this Report, there have been no significant changes to the accounting policies, estimates and assumptions, or the judgments affecting the application of these estimates and assumptions from those disclosed in Synovus' 2019 Form 10-K. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill assessments are highly sensitive to economic projections and the related assumptions and estimates used by management. Synovus includes goodwill impairment analysis and reporting unit valuations as part of its critical accounting policy for fair value measurements. For additional information, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Synovus' 2019 Form 10-K and "Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" in this Report. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The measures entitled adjusted non-interest revenue; adjusted non-interest expense; adjusted total revenues; adjusted tangible efficiency ratio; adjusted net income per common share, diluted; adjusted return on average assets; adjusted return on average common equity; return on average tangible common equity, adjusted return on average tangible common equity; and tangible common equity ratio are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The most comparable GAAP measures to these measures are total non-interest revenue; total non-interest expense; total revenues; efficiency ratio-FTE; net income per common share, diluted; return on average assets; return on average common equity; and the ratio of total shareholders' equity to total assets, respectively. 

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about Synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating Synovus&#8217; operating results, financial strength, the performance of its business, and the strength of its capital position. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors, and since they are not required to be uniformly applied, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies. Adjusted total revenues and adjusted non-interest revenue are measures used by management to evaluate non-interest revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains (losses) and gains on sale and changes in fair value of private equity investments, net. Adjusted non-interest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs. Adjusted net income per common share, diluted, adjusted return on average assets, and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. Return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity are measures used by management to compare Synovus' performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization, thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently. The tangible common equity ratio is used by management to assess the strength of our capital position. The computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below.
