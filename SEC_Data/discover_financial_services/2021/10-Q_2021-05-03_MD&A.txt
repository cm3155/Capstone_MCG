Table of Contents 

Our primary revenues consist of interest income earned on loan receivables and fees earned from customers, financial institutions, merchants and issuers. The primary expenses required to operate our business include funding costs (interest expense), credit loss provisions, customer rewards and expenses incurred to grow, manage and service our loan receivables and networks. Our business activities are funded primarily through consumer deposits, securitization of loan receivables and the issuance of unsecured debt. 

COVID-19 Pandemic Response and Impact 

The coronavirus disease 2019 ("COVID-19") pandemic has continued to have a widespread and unprecedented impact on a global scale. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve rapidly. Its future effects are uncertain and it may be difficult to assess or predict the extent of the impacts of the pandemic on us as many factors are beyond our control and knowledge. For a discussion of the risks we face with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, the associated economic uncertainty, the steps taken to mitigate the pandemic and the resulting economic contraction, see the risk factors disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, under "Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors". This section includes a discussion of significant areas of potential impact on us of the COVID-19 pandemic and certain actions we are taking or expect to take in this time of uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Financial Results and Outlook 

We saw an increase in sales volume for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. Additionally, we decreased our allowance for credit losses from December 31, 2020. The United States economy is recovering from a brief but severe recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. While uncertainty surrounding the pace and sustainability of economic recovery remains, improved economic trends and government stimulus have positively impacted credit performance and elevated consumer payment rates. 

We expect uncertainty in the economic recovery to continue this year, with the level of impact on our business dependent on the timing and shape of the economic recovery. We anticipate modest loan growth, the size of which will depend on payment rate trends and the timing and pace of the broad economic recovery. We expect net interest margin to remain relatively flat through the remainder of 2021. We expect net charge-offs to be relatively flat to lower year-over-year, as a result of the anticipated pace of economic recovery and recent government stimulus. We remain committed to disciplined expense management and will continue to make investments for profitable long-term growth through increased marketing as well as investments in core technology capabilities and efficiency improvements. 

Regulatory and Legislative 

Federal, state and local governments, including the United States Congress, the Executive Branch and independent banking agencies have taken extraordinary measures to support the United States economy and mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and on society at large. These policies have included regulatory relief and flexibility to financial institutions, liquidity to capital markets and financial support to businesses and consumers, including financial stimulus, payment forbearance, small business lending programs, increased unemployment payments and other forms of assistance. Lawmakers continue to offer additional proposals in an attempt to mitigate harm to the economy and consumers. The effects of these programs are broad and very complex and depend upon a wide variety of factors some of which are yet to be identified. Thus, the ultimate impact of these programs and policies on our business, results of operations and financial condition is difficult to quantify and may not be known for some time. For more information, see &#8220;&#8212; Regulatory Environment and Developments&#8221; below. 

Loan Receivables 

At the onset of the pandemic, we continued to lend to customers but tightened our standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts across all products in our loan portfolio. We continued to maintain tight underwriting standards given the macroeconomic uncertainties caused by the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic-induced recession. At the onset of the pandemic, we expanded borrower relief offerings to include Skip-a-Pay (payment deferral) ("SaP") programs and other loan modification programs, complementing the assistance already available through our existing loan modification programs. 

In the first quarter of 2021, we decreased our allowance for credit losses in anticipation of lower credit losses caused by the continued stable credit performance and improvements in the macroeconomic forecast. Our allowance for credit losses includes the risk associated with all loans and considers the effects of all loan modifications, including troubled debt 

Table of Contents 

restructurings ("TDRs"), loan modifications exempt from the TDR designation under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act&#8221;) and SaP programs. The allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2021, took into account our best estimate for the impact of programs put in place by federal and state governments and agencies to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. It is unclear whether the measures employed to date are complete or whether federal and state governments and agencies may take additional action that could impact our business. Refer to "&#8212; Loan Quality &#8212; Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Loan Portfolio" for more details on the current period allowance for credit losses. 

Capital and Liquidity 

While uncertainty about the path and timing of economic recovery remains, forecasts of economic growth have become increasingly favorable. In response to the macroeconomic uncertainty, as of March 31, 2021, we maintained liquid assets and capital levels in excess of historical norms. Furthermore, we have observed strong consumer loan payment rates and deposits demand, which increased our cash and other liquid asset balances since the onset of the pandemic and curtailed our need for wholesale funding. However, we maintain good access to all of our diverse funding channels and credit spreads have returned to pre-pandemic levels. 

We remain well-capitalized with capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimums and took prudent actions to preserve and augment our capital when the macroeconomic and operating environment turned uncertain last year. In light of the ongoing recovery in macroeconomic conditions, we resumed our common stock repurchase program during the first quarter of 2021. Additionally, we completed capital stress tests during the first quarter of 2021 in conjunction with our annual capital plan and maintain ample capital to ensure we remain well-capitalized while continuing to serve our customers and extend assistance to those who need it. 

For purposes of calculating regulatory capital, we have elected to defer recognition of the estimated impact of the adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss ("CECL") accounting model on regulatory capital for two years in accordance with the interim final rule announced by Federal banking regulators on March 27, 2020. Pursuant to the interim final rule, the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital will be phased in over a three-year period beginning in 2022. 

Payment Services 

As governments across the world have taken steps to minimize the transmission of COVID-19, the number of cross-border transactions processed on the Discover Global Network has declined. Certain negatively impacted categories such as travel may have an outsized impact on some of our Diners Club franchisees. The impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic may result in lasting changes in consumer payment behaviors, such as a shift from credit to debit, a decline in the use of cash, increasing online sales and rapid adoption of contactless payment. As economic uncertainty persists, these shifts may continue to result in changes to the Payment Services segment&#8217;s results of operations. 

Fair Value and Impairments 

With the uncertain nature of the pandemic's overall impact to the economy, we continue to assess the impact of COVID-19 with respect to our goodwill and intangible assets, investment securities and other long-term assets and determined that there were no material impairments necessary during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. For more information on the impact of COVID-19 on intangible assets, see Note 5: Intangible Assets to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Business Continuity and Operations 

We have re-opened some of our physical locations with appropriate health safety measures and capacity limitations, including our corporate headquarters. However, we have informed employees that they may continue to work from home and will not be required to return to our physical locations until September 2021, at the earliest. Notwithstanding the shift to work-from-home, our operations continue largely unaffected due to the successful implementation of certain of our business continuity plans. Operational changes necessitated by the rapid shift in employee location have not thus far had a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition; however, the shift has caused us to grow increasingly dependent on third-party service providers, including those with which we have no relationship such as our employees&#8217; internet service providers. For more information on the risks associated with reliance on third-party service providers and the shift to work from home, see the risk factors disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, under "Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors".

Regulatory Environment and Developments 

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to dramatically impact the U.S. and global economies. We continue to work with our customers to address their unique financial situations, while balancing safety and soundness requirements. We are in contact with our regulators, who continue to proactively encourage banks to work with borrowers during this time of stress. Among other actions, the federal banking agencies have taken the following measures to proactively address the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 outbreak and provide flexibility for banking organizations to work with impacted businesses and consumers: 

&#8226; Market Stabilization: The Federal Reserve reduced short-term interest rates to near zero and launched numerous programs and facilities, including the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, to increase market liquidity and promote stability; 

&#8226; Capital &#38; Liquidity Flexibility: Regulatory agencies issued statements urging banks to use their capital and liquidity buffers to continue lending during the crisis; 

&#8226; CECL: A joint agency final rule on CECL provided banks, such as Discover, with the option to delay CECL's impact on regulatory capital for two years, followed by three-year phase-in of those impacts. The United States Department of the Treasury subsequently released a study on CECL impacts, noting the need to continue to assess and potentially make changes to the standard or regulatory capital requirements; 

&#8226; Flexibility to Work with Consumers: The agencies issued joint guidance encouraging banks to work with borrowers and provided guidelines for prudent relief programs. The agencies worked with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") to provide accounting-classification flexibility for certain short-term loan modifications. Subsequently, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (&#8220;FFIEC&#8221;) issued a statement emphasizing the need for institutions to utilize &#8220;prudent risk management and consumer protection principle&#8230;while working with borrowers as loans near the end of initial loan accommodation periods&#8221;; 

&#8226; Pandemic Planning: The FFIEC released updated guidance to remind banks of actions they should be taking to minimize potential adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on business continuity; and 

&#8226; Supervisory Flexibility: Regulatory agencies have indicated willingness to work with institutions to provide flexibility and minimize burdens of supervisory activities, including extending deadlines for data collections. 

&#8226; On March 31, 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) announced it was rescinding several of its own policy statements as well as withdrawing its participation in a number of interagency policy statements issued in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that had been intended to provide flexibility to financial institutions. The CFPB stated that the rescissions &#8220;reflect the Bureau&#8217;s commitment to consumer protection and the fact that financial institutions have had a year to adapt their operations to the difficulties posed by the pandemic&#8221;. 

In addition to the above regulatory actions, legislative action was taken to address the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic: 

&#8226; CARES Act: Enactment of the CARES Act in March 2020 provided expanded unemployment benefits and direct stimulus payments to impacted consumers and offered relief to consumers through changes to credit reporting requirements and mandated forbearance on certain federally-backed mortgages and federal student loans. The CARES Act provided the option for financial institutions, including Discover, to temporarily suspend certain accounting requirements related to TDRs and delay the effective date of CECL for the duration of the national emergency. See "&#8212; Banking &#8212; Capital Standards and Stress Testing" and "&#8212; Loan Quality &#8212; Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Loan Portfolio" below for more information. 

&#8226; Omnibus and COVID Relief and Response Act: Enactment of additional COVID relief in the 2021 Appropriations bill, H.R. 133, in December 2020 provided additional stimulus payments, increased unemployment benefits, increased small business funding under the Payment Protection Program and extended many CARES Act provisions, including those related to TDRs. Section 541 of the Omnibus and COVID Relief and Response Act extended the TDR accounting and reporting relief provided by the CARES Act through the earlier of January 1, 2022, or the date that is 60 days after the termination of the national emergency declared by the President of the United States of America on March 13, 2020, under the National Emergencies Act related to the outbreak of COVID-19. On February 24, 2021, President Biden issued a letter on the continuation of the national emergency 

Table of Contents 

related to COVID-19. We have elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided under section 4013 of the CARES Act and extended by Section 541 of the Omnibus and COVID Relief and Response Act. 

&#8226; American Rescue Plan of 2021 ("ARPA"): Enacted in March 2021, this law contains additional stimulus payments, increased unemployment benefits and increased small business funding under the Payment Protection Program. 

As the pandemic continues into its second year, additional legislative and regulatory action may be proposed and could include provisions that significantly impact our prospects and business practices. The impact of these legislative and regulatory initiatives on us, the economy and the United States consumer will depend upon a wide variety of factors some of which are yet to be identified.

Capital Standards and Stress Testing 

Discover is subject to mandatory supervisory stress tests every other year and is required to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve based on internal forward-looking analysis of income and capital levels under expected and stressful conditions. Discover is also subject to capital buffer requirements, including the Stress Capital Buffer ("SCB"), which requires maintenance of regulatory capital levels above a threshold that is established based on the results of supervisory stress tests after accounting for planned dividend payments. 

On June 25, 2020, we received results of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s supervisory stress tests and preliminary SCB requirement. The notice indicated that Discover&#8217;s capital ratios remain above all required minimums under each of the supervisory scenarios and based on the stress test results our preliminary SCB requirement was set at 3.5%, which was announced as final in a public notice issued by the Federal Reserve on August 10, 2020. However, in addition to the stress test and SCB results, the Federal Reserve also notified Discover that it and all other firms that participated in the 2020 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") exercise would be required to submit a revised capital plan to be assessed by the Federal Reserve under newly developed scenarios incorporating economic stresses reflecting the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve notified all firms subject to CCAR that they would be subject to temporary restrictions on capital distributions in the third and fourth quarter of 2020 that restricted most share repurchases and limited dividends based on a formula that takes into account the firm's average net income over the preceding four quarters. 

On November 2, 2020, Discover submitted its revised capital plan as part of the CCAR resubmission process and the Federal Reserve publicly announced results of its analysis on December 18, 2020. The results indicate that Discover&#8217;s regulatory capital ratios remained above all minimum requirements under each of the stress test scenarios. However, due to ongoing economic uncertainty, the Federal Reserve has extended the temporary restrictions on capital distributions, with modifications, for all firms subject to the Federal Reserve's capital planning rule through the second quarter of 2021. For the first and second quarters of 2021, provided Discover does not increase the amount of its common stock dividends, Discover may pay common stock dividends and make share repurchases that, in the aggregate, do not exceed an amount equal to the average of Discover&#8217;s net income for the four preceding quarters. The Federal Reserve has not yet indicated whether it will use the results of the mid-cycle stress test to adjust Discover's or other firms&#8217; SCB requirement. On March 25, 2021, the Federal Reserve extended the right to recalculate Discover's SCBs through June 30, 2021.We will continue to conduct forward-looking sensitivity analysis and stress tests to assess the potential impact of economic changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic on capital planning and provide this information to our Board of Directors as well as our regulators. 

On January 19, 2021, the Federal Reserve finalized regulatory amendments that make targeted changes to the capital planning, regulatory reporting and SCB requirements for firms subject to Category IV standards to be consistent with the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulatory tailoring framework. The final rules generally align to instructions that had previously been provided by the Federal Reserve to Category IV firms for recent capital plan submissions. The amended rules also provides Category IV firms with the option to submit to supervisory stress tests during off years if they wish to have the stress test portion of their SCB reset. The Federal Reserve had solicited comment on the need for possible changes to regulatory guidance related to the capital planning process. In connection with the final rulemaking, the Federal Reserve revised the scope of application of its existing regulatory guidance for capital planning to align to the tailoring framework. However, the timing and substance of any additional changes to existing guidance or new guidance is uncertain. 

Table of Contents 

As a Category IV firm, Discover was not required to participate in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s supervisory stress tests as part of the 2021 CCAR process. Discover and other Category IV firms had the option under the recently amended capital plan rule to elect to participate in supervisory stress tests at the firm&#8217;s discretion. However, Discover did not elect to participate this year. Nevertheless, Discover was required to prepare and submit a capital plan based on an internal forward-looking assessment of income and capital under baseline and stressful conditions. Discover submitted its 2021 capital plan to the Federal Reserve on April 5, 2021. The Federal Reserve will use our 2021 capital plan submission to assess its capital planning process and positions and to reset the portion of our SCB requirement that is based on four quarters of planned common stock dividends. These results are expected to be provided by the Federal Reserve in late-June or early-July of 2021. 

LIBOR 

On July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") announced that it would no longer encourage or compel banks to continue to contribute quotes and maintain the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") after 2021. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced the future cessation and loss of representativeness for all LIBOR benchmark settings. While non-U.S. Dollar ("USD") and several less frequently referenced USD LIBOR settings will cease publication immediately after December 31, 2021, commonly referenced USD LIBOR settings will cease publication immediately after June 30, 2023. To support a smooth transition away from LIBOR, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ("ARRC"), a group of private-market participants tasked with ensuring a successful transition from USD LIBOR to a more robust reference rate. The ARRC identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") as the alternative reference rate for USD LIBOR. Additionally, the ARRC has established several priorities and milestones to support the use of SOFR, including developing contractual fallback language for capital markets and consumer products; providing clarity on legal, tax, accounting and regulatory matters; and promoting broad outreach and education efforts around the LIBOR transition. 

We have offered and continue to offer floating-rate private student loans based on LIBOR. These loans comprise approximately 43% of our private student loan portfolio or approximately 5% of our overall loan portfolio. Our floating-rate borrowings are indexed to LIBOR and limited to asset-backed securities issued by our securitization trusts. United States banking regulators have reinforced the need to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021. We have a cross-functional team overseeing and managing our transition away from the use of LIBOR. This team assesses evolving industry and marketplace norms and conventions for LIBOR-indexed instruments, evaluates the impacts stemming from the future cessation of LIBOR publication and facilitates the operational changes associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate. 

Consumer Financial Services 

The CFPB regulates consumer financial products and services and examines certain providers of consumer financial products and services, including Discover. The CFPB's authority includes preventing "unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices" and ensuring that consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive financial products and services. The CFPB has rulemaking, supervision and enforcement powers with respect to federal consumer protection laws. Historically, the CFPB's policy priorities focused on several financial products of the type we offer (e.g. credit cards and other consumer lending products). In addition, the CFPB is required by statute to undertake certain actions including its biennial review of the consumer credit card market. In December 2020, certain of our subsidiaries entered into a consent order with the CFPB regarding certain private student loan servicing practices. See Note 14: Litigation and Regulatory Matters to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. 

President Biden has nominated Federal Trade Commissioner Rohit Chopra to serve as the Director of the CFPB. Until Mr. Chopra is confirmed by the United States Senate, David Uejio will serve as acting Director of the CFPB. Under Mr. Chopra&#8217;s leadership, the CFPB&#8217;s priorities are expected to focus on, among other things, vigorous enforcement of existing consumer protection laws, with a particular focus on unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices, student lending and servicing, fair lending and debt collection. These changes to the CFPB&#8217;s strategies and priorities and any resulting regulatory developments, findings, potential supervisory or enforcement actions and ratings could negatively impact our business strategies, require us to limit or change our business practices, limit our product offerings, invest more management time and resources in compliance efforts, limit the fees we can charge for services, or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities and obtain related required regulatory approvals. The additional expense, time and resources needed to comply with ongoing or new regulatory requirements may adversely impact our business and results of operations. 

President Biden&#8217;s nomination of a new CFPB Director as well as a new head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will also change the composition of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). 

Table of Contents 

Although the term of the FDIC&#8217;s Chair does not expire until 2024, the Board may not adopt and approve her priorities for the FDIC. 

Data Security and Privacy 

Policymakers at the federal and state levels remain focused on measures to enhance data security and data breach incident response requirements. Furthermore, regulations and legislation at various levels of government have been proposed and enacted to augment consumer data privacy standards. The California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") creates a broad set of privacy rights and remedies modeled in part on the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General's final regulations became effective on August 14, 2020, with enforcement beginning July 1, 2020. The California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"), a ballot measure led by the original proponent of the CCPA, passed on November 3, 2020, and largely enters into force on January 1, 2023. The CPRA replaces the CCPA to further enhance consumer privacy protections and creates a new California Privacy Protection Agency. While the CPRA retains an exemption for information collected, processed, sold, or disclosed subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, we continue to evaluate the impact of the CPRA on our businesses and other providers of consumer financial services.

Digital Banking 

Our Digital Banking segment reported pretax income of $2.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to a pretax loss of $161 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

Net interest income decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020 primarily driven by a lower average level of loan receivables and lower yields on loans, partially offset by lower funding costs. Interest income decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a lower average level of credit card loan receivables, driven by higher payment rates, as well as lower yields on loans due to lower market rates. Interest expense decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020 due to lower average market rates, lower pricing on deposits and higher coupon maturities, partially offset by a larger funding base. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the provision for credit losses decreased as compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to the favorable change in the macroeconomic outlook related to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic-induced recession. For a detailed discussion on provision for credit losses, see "&#8212; Loan Quality &#8212; Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses." 

Total other income increased for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020, which was primarily due to an increase in discount and interchange revenue, partially offset by a decrease in loan fee income. The increase in discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by an increase in rewards costs, both of which were the result of higher sales volume. Loan fee income decreased primarily due to lower late fees and cash advance fees. 

Total other expense decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in marketing and business development and other expense, partially offset by an increase in employee compensation and benefits. Marketing costs decreased primarily due to expense reductions in acquisition and brand advertising for our credit card product. The decrease in other expense was primarily driven by lower fraud losses. Employee compensation and benefits increased as a result of higher bonus accruals and higher average salaries.

Discover card sales volume was $37.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which was an increase of 11.1% as compared to the same period in 2020. This volume growth was primarily driven by higher consumer spending. 

Payment Services 

Our Payment Services segment reported pretax income of $52 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to pretax income of $83 million for the same period in 2020. The decrease in segment pretax income was primarily due to lower other income driven by a gain from the sale of investments during the first quarter of 2020. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain. For estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity, it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period. For estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions, significant changes to the estimated amount from period-to-period are also possible. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our condensed consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain cases, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition. Management has identified the estimates related to our allowance for credit losses as a critical accounting estimate. Discussion of critical accounting estimates related to the allowance for credit losses are discussed in greater detail in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. That discussion can be found within "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Critical Accounting Estimates." There have not been any material changes in the methods used to formulate these critical accounting estimates from those discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Net Interest Income 

The table that follows this section has been provided to supplement the discussion below and provide further analysis of net interest income and net interest margin. Net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets. We analyze net interest income in total by calculating net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total loan receivables) and net yield on interest-earning assets (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets). We also separately consider the impact of the level of loan receivables and the related interest yield and the impact of the cost of funds related to each of our funding sources, along with the income generated by our liquidity portfolio, on net interest income. 

Our interest-earning assets consist of: (i) cash and cash equivalents primarily related to amounts on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, (ii) restricted cash, (iii) other short-term investments, (iv) investment securities and (v) loan receivables. Our interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits, both direct-to-consumer and brokered, and long-term borrowings, including amounts owed to securitization investors. Net interest income is influenced by the following: 

&#8226; The level and composition of loan receivables, including the proportion of credit card loans to other loans, as well as the proportion of loan receivables bearing interest at promotional rates as compared to standard rates; 

&#8226; The credit performance of our loans, particularly with regard to charge-offs of finance charges, which reduce interest income; 

&#8226; The terms of long-term borrowings and certificates of deposit upon initial offering, including maturity and interest rate; 

&#8226; The interest rates necessary to attract and maintain direct-to-consumer deposits; 

&#8226; The level and composition of other interest-earning assets, including our liquidity portfolio and interest-bearing liabilities; 

&#8226; Changes in the interest rate environment, including the levels of interest rates and the relationships among interest rate indices, such as the prime rate, the Federal Funds rate, interest rate on excess reserves and LIBOR; and 

&#8226; The effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program. 

&#160; Net interest income decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020 primarily driven by a lower average level of loan receivables and lower yields on loans, partially offset by lower funding costs. Interest income decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a lower average level of credit card loan receivables, driven by higher payment rates, as well as lower yields on loans due to lower market rates. Interest expense decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020 due to lower average market rates, lower pricing on deposits and higher coupon maturities, partially offset by a larger funding base.

Loan Quality 

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Loan Portfolio 

The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact to the economy has had a significant effect on our sales volume and credit card loan growth. We tightened standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts across all products at the onset of the pandemic. While sales volume has increased for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020, we continued to maintain tightened underwriting standards given the macroeconomic uncertainties caused by the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic-induced recession. The tightened underwriting standards and higher payment rate by consumers, along with the seasonality of our credit card loan portfolio, contributed to the decrease in our outstanding loans receivable as of March 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. 

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded borrower relief offerings to include SaP and other loan modification programs, complementing the assistance already available through our existing loan modification programs. On August 31, 2020, we ceased offering enrollments in the SaP and other loan modification programs developed specifically in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The accounts using these modifications as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated for potential exclusion from the TDR designation either due to the insignificance of the concession or because they qualified for exemption pursuant to the CARES Act. The SaP programs provided only an insignificant delay in payment on the enrolled accounts or loans and therefore those deferrals were not classified as TDRs. 

The utilization of these SaP programs had a favorable impact on reported credit performance in 2020 because accounts enrolled in the SaP programs did not advance through delinquency cycles in the same time frame as they would have without the programs. As the SaP programs ended in August 2020, certain loans that subsequently exited the SaP programs began advancing through the delinquency cycle or to charge-off as appropriate. The impact to loan delinquencies was most pronounced in the second quarter of 2020 when the SaP programs were initially offered; the impact dissipated as enrollments tapered off significantly after the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first quarter of 2021, net charge-offs were unfavorably impacted by accounts that had been enrolled in a SaP program and were unable to cure their default. 

Section 4013 of the CARES Act provides certain financial institutions with the option to suspend the application of accounting and reporting guidance for TDRs for a limited period of time for loan modifications made to address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Section 541 of the Omnibus and COVID Relief and Response Act extended the TDR accounting and reporting relief provided by the CARES Act through the earlier of January 1, 2022, or the date that is 60 days after the termination of the presidentially-declared national emergency. We elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting and reporting guidance for TDRs as provided under Section 4013 of the CARES Act and as subsequently extended. As such, TDR program balances and number of accounts for the three months ended March 31, 2021, have been favorably impacted by the exclusion of certain modifications from the TDR designation pursuant to these exemptions and are expected to remain lower than they otherwise would have been. The payment status of modified accounts excluded from the TDR designation pursuant to the CARES Act is reflected in our delinquency reporting.

The table below reflects the number and balance of both new loan modifications reported as TDRs and new loan modifications excluded from the TDR designation pursuant to the CARES Act (dollars in millions) (1) : Accounts that entered a loan modification program and were classified as TDRs during the period Accounts that entered a loan modification program and were exempt from the TDR designation pursuant to the CARES Act (2)

(1) As the TDR exemption pursuant to the CARES Act took effect in March 2020, the three months ended March 31, 2021 is not comparable to the same period in 2020. 

(2) SaP programs were not considered TDRs and therefore are not included in accounts excluded from the TDR designation by the CARES Act. 

(3) Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. 

The number and balance of new credit card and personal loan modifications, including the combined total of those designated as TDRs and those exempt from the TDR status, decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020. The decrease is due to the impacts of government stimulus and government-offered disaster relief programs, which is consistent with the delinquency and net charge-off trends discussed within "&#8212; Delinquencies" and "&#8212; Net Charge-offs," respectively. The number and balance of new private student loan modifications, including the combined total of those designated as TDRs and those exempt from the TDR designation pursuant to the CARES Act, increased during the three months ended March 31, 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020. The increase was due to the utilization of SaP programs in 2020 in lieu of traditional loan modification programs. SaP programs do not constitute TDRs given the insignificant delay in payment; they are therefore also excluded from TDRs evaluated for exemption pursuant to the CARES Act. This increase was partially offset by the impacts of government stimulus and government-offered disaster relief programs in the current period. 

The following table provides the number of accounts that exited a temporary loan modification program that were exempt from the TDR designation pursuant to the CARES Act and corresponding outstanding balances along with the amount of the outstanding balances that were delinquent (30 or more days past due) upon exiting the temporary loan modification program (dollars in millions) (1) :

Our estimate of expected loss reflected in our allowance for credit losses includes the risk associated with all loans and considers the effects of all loan modifications, including TDRs, loan modifications exempt from the TDR designation pursuant to the CARES Act and SaP programs. We believe we have appropriately reflected the risk presented by the accounts using these programs as well as the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers in the allowance for credit losses. Refer to Note 3: Loan Receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more details on modification programs, TDRs and the allowance for credit losses. 

Loan receivables consist of the following (dollars in millions): March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Credit card loans $ 67,304 $ 71,472 Other loans Private student loans 10,153 9,954 Personal loans 6,961 7,177 Other loans 1,929 1,846 Total other loans 19,043 18,977 Total loan receivables 86,347 90,449 Allowance for credit losses (7,347) (8,226) Net loan receivables $ 79,000 $ 82,223 

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimate of credit losses anticipated over the remaining expected life of loan receivables at each period end date. In deriving the estimate of expected credit loss, we consider the collectability of principal, interest and fees associated with our loan receivables. We also consider expected recoveries of amounts that were either previously charged off or are expected to be charged off. Establishing the estimate for expected credit losses requires significant management judgment. The factors that influence the provision for credit losses include: 

&#8226; Increases or decreases in outstanding loan balances, including: 

&#8226; Changes in consumer spending, payment and credit utilization behaviors; 

&#8226; The level of originations and maturities; and 

&#8226; Changes in the overall mix of accounts and products within the portfolio; 

&#8226; The credit quality of the loan portfolio, which reflects our credit granting practices and the effectiveness of collection efforts, among other factors; 

&#8226; The impact of general economic conditions on the consumer, including national and regional conditions, unemployment levels, bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements; 

&#8226; The level and direction of historical losses; and 

&#8226; Regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance. 

For more details on how we estimate the allowance for credit losses, refer to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Critical Accounting Estimates" within our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and Note 3: Loan Receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

(2) Prior to adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, credit losses were estimated using the incurred loss approach. 

(3) Represents the adjustment to the allowance for credit losses as a result of adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. 

The allowance for credit losses was $7.3 billion at March 31, 2021, which reflects an $879 million release from the amount of the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2020. The release in the overall allowance was primarily driven by a reduction in loan receivables outstanding, continued stable credit performance and improvements in the macroeconomic forecast. 

The decrease in our outstanding loans receivable, particularly our credit card loans, and the stable credit performance was driven in part by elevated payment rates resulting from the latest round of government stimulus and the associated improvement in household cash flows. In estimating expected credit losses, we considered the uncertainties associated with borrower behavior, payment trends and credit performance subsequent to the expiration of government stimulus programs, such as the CARES Act and ARPA, and government-offered disaster relief programs, such as foreclosure moratoriums and federal student loan and mortgage payment forbearance. 

In estimating the allowance at March 31, 2021, we used a macroeconomic forecast that projected (i) a peak unemployment rate of 6.7%, which decreases to 6.0% through the end of 2021, and (ii) a 4.6% growth in real gross domestic product in 2021. Labor market conditions, which historically have been an important determinant of our credit loss trends, have improved but remain stressed by the pandemic; unemployment claims have fallen below pandemic peaks, but unemployment remains elevated by historical standards. Moreover, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and the government's response to the pandemic has continued to cause uncertainty in our assumptions surrounding factors 

Table of Contents 

such as the pace and sustainability of economic recovery. Accordingly, the estimation of the allowance for credit losses has required significant management judgment. 

The forecast period we deemed to be reasonable and supportable was 18 months as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The 18-month reasonable and supportable forecast period was deemed appropriate on the basis of observed stabilization of macroeconomic forecasts. As of March 31, 2020, the forecast period we deemed to be reasonable and supportable was 12 months due to the uncertainty caused by the rapidly changing economic environment experienced at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

As of March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, and March 31, 2020, we determined that a reversion period of 12 months was appropriate. During the first quarter of 2020, a straight-line method was used to revert to appropriate historical information. Due to the uncertainties associated with borrower behavior resulting from government stimulus and disaster relief programs, we applied a weighted reversion method to provide for a more reasonable transition to historical losses for all loan products as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

The provision for credit losses is the amount of expense realized after considering the level of net charge-offs in the period and the required amount of allowance for credit losses at the balance sheet date. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the provision for credit losses decreased by $2.2 billion, or 119%, as compared to the same periods in 2020. The largest driver of the decrease in provision between the two periods was the favorable change in the macroeconomic outlook related to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic-induced recession. 

Net Charge-offs 

Our net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude charged-off and recovered interest and fees and fraud losses. Charged-off and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest income and loan fee income, respectively, which is effectively a reclassification of the provision for credit losses, while fraud losses are recorded in other expense. 

The following table presents amounts and rates of net charge-offs of key loan products (dollars in millions): &#160; For the Three Months Ended March 31, &#160; 2021 2020 &#160; $ % $ % Credit card loans $ 474 2.80 % $ 683 3.65 % Private student loans $ 14 0.53 % $ 17 0.68 % Personal loans $ 49 2.80 % $ 69 3.59 % 

The decrease in net charge-offs and net charge-off rates across all loan products for the three months ended March 31, 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily due to the impacts of government stimulus and government-offered disaster relief programs, partially offset by accounts that had been in an SaP program and did not cure. The decrease in net charge-offs on credit card loans was also favorably impacted by a decrease in outstanding loan receivables period-over-period. The decrease in net charge-offs on personal loans also reflects tightened underwriting standards implemented around the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Delinquencies 

Delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at a point in time. A loan balance is considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become 30 days past due. 

The following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of key loan products that are 30 and 90 days or more delinquent, loan receivables that are not accruing interest regardless of delinquency and loans restructured in TDR programs (dollars in millions): &#160; March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 &#160; $ % $ % Loans 30 or more days delinquent Credit card loans $ 1,245 1.85 % $ 1,478 2.07 % Private student loans $ 122 1.20 % $ 138 1.39 % Personal loans $ 59 0.84 % $ 78 1.08 %

(1) Credit card loans that were 90 or more days delinquent at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, included $63 million and $44 million, respectively, in modified loans exempt from the TDR designation under the CARES Act. Within private student and personal loans that were 90 or more days delinquent at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the respective amounts associated with modifications exempt from the TDR designation under the CARES Act were immaterial. 

(2) We estimate that interest income recognized on credit card loans restructured in TDR programs was $33 million and $71 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We do not separately track interest income on loans in TDR programs. This amount was estimated by applying an average interest rate to the average loans in the various TDR programs. 

(3) We estimate that the incremental interest income that would have been recorded in accordance with the original terms of credit card loans restructured in TDR programs was $37 million and $54 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We do not separately track the amount of incremental interest income that would have been recorded if the loans in TDR programs had not been restructured and interest had instead been recorded in accordance with the original terms. This amount was estimated by applying the difference between the average interest rate earned on non-modified loans and the average interest rate earned on loans in the TDR programs to the average loans in the TDR programs. 

(4) Credit card loans restructured in TDR programs include $85 million and $94 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, which are also included in loans 90 or more days delinquent. 

(5) Private student loans restructured in TDR programs include $6 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, which are also included in loans 90 or more days delinquent. 

(6) Personal loans restructured in TDR programs include $5 million and $6 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, which are also included in loans 90 or more days delinquent. 

The 30-day and 90-day delinquency rates in the table above include all loans, including TDRs, modified loans exempt from TDR status and prior modifications which are no longer required to be reported as TDRs. The 30-day and 90-day delinquency rates across credit card loans and personal loans, as well as the 30-day delinquency rates for private student loans at March 31, 2021, decreased compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to government stimulus and government-offered disaster relief programs. The 30-day and 90-day delinquency rates for personal loans were also favorably impacted by tightened underwriting standards implemented around the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 90-day delinquency rate for private student loans as March 31, 2021, was essentially flat. 

Table of Contents 

The balance of loans reported as TDRs across all loan products decreased at March 31, 2021, as compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to elevated payment rates resulting from the latest round of government stimulus and the associated improvement in household cash flows. Additionally, the balance of loans reported as TDRs continues to be favorably impacted by the accounts qualifying for the exemption from the TDR designation pursuant to the CARES Act as well as the exclusion of prior TDRs that were subsequently restructured to a market interest rate and the customer has demonstrated financial stability. To provide additional clarity with respect to credit card loans classified as TDRs, the table above presents loans that are currently enrolled in modification programs separately from loans that have exited those programs but retain that classification. 

The following table provides the balance of loan receivables restructured through a temporary loan modification program that were exempt from the TDR designation pursuant to the CARES Act (dollars in millions): 

&#160; March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 &#160; $ % $ % Credit card loans $ 1,479 2.20 % $ 1,351 1.89 % Private student loans $ 136 1.34 % $ 101 1.01 % Personal loans $ 72 1.03 % $ 73 1.02 % 

We believe loan modification programs are useful in assisting customers experiencing financial difficulties and help to prevent defaults. We plan to continue to use loan modification programs as a means to provide relief to customers experiencing temporary financial difficulties. See Note 3: Loan Receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further description of our use of loan modification programs to provide relief to customers experiencing financial hardship. 

Modified and Restructured Loans 

For information regarding modified and restructured loans, see "&#8212; Delinquencies", "&#8212; Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Loan Portfolio", "&#8212; COVID-19 Pandemic Response and Impact &#8212; Loan Receivables" and Note 3: Loan Receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Other Income 

The following table presents the components of other income (dollars in millions): &#160; For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 vs 2020 Increase (Decrease) 2021 2020 $ %

Total other income decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in gains on equity investments and loan fee income, partially offset by an increase in discount and interchange revenue. Gains on equity investments decreased primarily from a sale during the first quarter of 2020. Loan fee income decreased primarily due to lower late fees and cash advance fees. The increase in discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by an increase in rewards costs, both of which were primarily the result of higher sales volume.

Other Expense 

The following table represents the components of other expense (dollars in millions): &#160; For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 vs. 2020 Increase (Decrease) &#160; 2021 2020 $ % Employee compensation and benefits $ 506 $ 467 $ 39 8 % Marketing and business development 154 231 (77) (33) % Information processing and communications 109 114 (5) (4) % Professional fees 182 193 (11) (6) % Premises and equipment 24 30 (6) (20) % Other expense 106 124 (18) (15) % Total other expense $ 1,081 $ 1,159 $ (78) (7) % 

Total other expense decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in marketing and business development and other expense, partially offset by an increase in employee compensation and benefits. Marketing costs decreased primarily due to expense reductions in acquisition and brand advertising for our credit card product. The decrease in other expense was primarily driven by lower fraud losses. Employee compensation and benefits increased as a result of higher bonus accruals and higher average salaries. 

Income Tax Expense 

The following table presents the calculation of the effective income tax rate (dollars in millions): &#160; For the Three Months Ended March 31, &#160; 2021 2020 Income (loss) before income taxes $ 2,079 $ (78) Income tax expense (benefit) $ 486 $ (17) Effective income tax rate 23.4 % 22.0 % 

Income tax expense and the effective tax rate increased $503 million and 1.4 percentage points, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. The increase in income tax expense was primarily driven by an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rate increased primarily due to tax credits having a lower rate benefit on higher pretax income. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Liquidity and Capital 

The United States&#8217; economy is recovering from a brief but severe recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. While uncertainty about the path and timing of economic recovery remains, vaccines have become more widely available in the United States and forecasts of economic growth have become increasingly favorable. In response to the macroeconomic uncertainty, we maintained liquid assets and capital levels in excess of historical norms as of March 31, 2021. Furthermore, we have observed strong consumer loan payment rates and deposits demand, which increased our cash and other liquid asset balances since the onset of the pandemic and curtailed our need for wholesale funding. However, we maintain good access to all of our diverse funding channels and credit spreads have returned to pre-pandemic levels. 

We remain well-capitalized with capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimums and took prudent actions to preserve and augment our capital when the macroeconomic and operating environment turned uncertain last year. In light of the ongoing recovery in macroeconomic conditions, we resumed our common stock repurchase program during the first quarter of 2021. Additionally, we completed capital stress tests during the first quarter of 2021 in conjunction with our annual capital plan and maintain ample capital to ensure we remain well-capitalized while continuing to serve our customers and extend assistance to those who need it.

Funding and Liquidity 

We seek to maintain stable, diversified and cost-effective funding sources and a strong liquidity profile in order to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations under both normal operating conditions and periods of economic or financial stress. In managing our liquidity risk, we seek to maintain a prudent liability maturity profile and ready access to an ample store of primary and contingent liquidity sources. Our primary funding sources include direct-to-consumer and brokered deposits, public term asset-backed securitizations and other short-term and long-term borrowings. Our primary liquidity sources include a liquidity portfolio comprised of highly liquid, unencumbered assets, including cash and cash equivalents, investment securities as well as secured borrowing capacity through private term asset-backed securitizations and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. In addition, we have unused borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve discount window, which provides another source of contingent liquidity. 

Funding Sources 

Deposits 

We offer deposit products to customers through two channels: (i) through direct marketing, internet origination and affinity relationships ("direct-to-consumer deposits"); and (ii) indirectly through contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms ("brokered deposits"). Direct-to-consumer deposits include online savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, IRA certificates of deposit and checking accounts, while brokered deposits include certificates of deposit and sweep accounts. At March 31, 2021, we had $64.1 billion of direct-to-consumer deposits and $12.6 billion of brokered deposits. 

Credit Card Securitization Financing 

We securitize credit card receivables as a source of funding. We access the asset-backed securitization market using the Discover Card Master Trust I ("DCMT") and the Discover Card Execution Note Trust ("DCENT"). In connection with our securitization transactions, credit card receivables are transferred to DCMT. DCMT has issued a certificate representing the beneficial interest in its credit card receivables to DCENT. We issue DCENT DiscoverSeries notes in both public and private transactions, which are collateralized by the beneficial interest certificate held by DCENT. From time to time, we may add credit card receivables to DCMT to create sufficient funding capacity for future securitizations while managing seller's interest. We retain significant exposure to the performance of the securitized credit card receivables through holdings of the seller's interest and subordinated classes of DCENT DiscoverSeries notes. At March 31, 2021, we had $10.6 billion of outstanding public asset-backed securities and $5.1 billion of outstanding subordinated asset-backed securities that had been issued to our wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

The securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors. The primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements, the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities. We refer to this as "economic early amortization," which is based on excess spread levels. Excess spread is the amount by which income received with respect to the securitized credit card receivables during a collection period, including interest collections, fees and interchange, exceeds the fees and expenses of DCENT during such collection period, including interest expense, servicing fees and charged-off receivables. In the event of an economic early amortization, which would occur if the excess spread fell below 0% on a three-month rolling average basis, we would be required to repay all outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received with respect to the securitized credit card receivables. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the DiscoverSeries three-month rolling average excess spread was 13.28%. The period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received. 

Through our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Discover Funding LLC, we are required to maintain an interest in a contractual minimum level of receivables in DCMT in excess of the face value of outstanding investors' interests. This minimum interest is referred to as the minimum seller's interest. The required minimum seller's interest in the pool of trust receivables, is set at approximately 7% in excess of the total investors' interests, which includes interests held by third parties as well as those interests held by us. If the level of receivables in DCMT were to fall below the required minimum, we would be required to add receivables from the unrestricted pool of receivables, which would increase the amount of credit card receivables restricted for securitization investors. A decline in the amount of the excess seller's interest could occur if balance repayments and charge-offs exceeded new lending on the securitized accounts or as a result of changes in total outstanding investors' interests. Seller's interest exhibits seasonality as higher receivable balance repayments tend to occur in the first calendar year quarter. If we could not add enough receivables to satisfy the minimum seller's interest requirement, an early amortization (or repayment) of investors' interests would be triggered. 

Table of Contents 

An early amortization event would impair our liquidity and may require us to utilize our available non-securitization related contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources, which may or may not be available at the time. We have several strategies we can deploy to prevent an early amortization event. For instance, we could add additional receivables to DCMT, which would reduce our available borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve discount window. As of March 31, 2021, there were $25.2 billion of credit card receivables in the trust and no accounts were added to those restricted for securitization investors for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Alternatively, we could employ structured discounting, which was used effectively in 2009 to bolster excess spread and mitigate early amortization risk. 

The following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors' interests in credit card securitizations, excluding those that have been issued to our wholly-owned subsidiaries (dollars in millions): At March 31, 2021 Total Less Than One Year One Year Through Three Years Four Years Through Five Years After Five Years Scheduled maturities of long-term borrowings - owed to credit card securitization investors $ 10,681 $ 6,021 $ 3,326 $ 1,334 $ &#8212; 

The "AAA(sf)" and "Aaa(sf)" ratings of the DCENT DiscoverSeries Class A Notes issued to date have been based, in part, on an FDIC rule, which created a safe harbor that provides that the FDIC, as conservator or receiver, will not use its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts, seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization, or recharacterize assets transferred in connection with a securitization as assets of the insured depository institution, provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous GAAP. Although the implementation of FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing , no longer qualified certain transfers of assets for sale accounting treatment, the FDIC approved a final rule that preserved the safe-harbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts, including DCMT, so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original FDIC safe harbor if evaluated under GAAP pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to December 2009. Other legislative and regulatory developments may, however, impact our ability or desire to issue asset-backed securities in the future. 

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances 

Discover Bank is a member bank of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, one of 11 Federal Home Loan Banks ("FHLBs") that, along with the Office of Finance, compose the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The FHLBs are government-sponsored enterprises of the United States of America ("U.S. GSEs") chartered to improve the availability of funds to support home ownership. As such, senior debt obligations of the FHLBs feature the same credit ratings as United States Treasury securities and are considered high-quality liquid assets for bank regulatory purposes. Consequently, the FHLBs benefit from consistent capital markets access during nearly all macroeconomic and financial market conditions and low funding costs, which they pass on to their member banks when they borrow advances. Thus, we consider FHLB advances a stable and reliable funding source for Discover Bank for short-term contingent liquidity and long-term asset-liability management. 

As a member of the FHLB of Chicago, we have access to both short- and long-term advance structures with maturities ranging from overnight to 30 years. At March 31, 2021, we had $1.1 billion of borrowing capacity through the FHLB of Chicago based on the amount and type of assets pledged. As of March 31, 2021, we have no borrowings outstanding with the FHLB of Chicago. Under certain stressed conditions, we could pledge our liquidity portfolio securities and borrow against them at a modest reduction to their value. 

Other Long-Term Borrowings&#8212;Private Student Loans 

At March 31, 2021, $123 million of remaining principal balance was outstanding on securitized debt assumed as part of our acquisition of The Student Loan Corporation. Principal and interest payments on the underlying private student loans will reduce the balance of these secured borrowings over time. 

Table of Contents 

Other Long-Term Borrowings&#8212;Corporate and Bank Debt 

The following table provides a summary of Discover Financial Services (Parent Company) and Discover Bank outstanding fixed-rate debt (dollars in millions): At March 31, 2021 Principal Amount Outstanding Discover Financial Services (Parent Company) fixed-rate senior notes, maturing 2022-2027 $ 3,422 Discover Financial Services (Parent Company) fixed-rate retail notes, maturing 2022-2031 $ 177 Discover Bank fixed-rate senior bank notes, maturing 2021-2030 $ 6,100 Discover Bank fixed-rate subordinated bank notes, maturing 2028 $ 500 

Certain Discover Financial Services senior notes require us to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a change of control involving us and a corresponding ratings downgrade to below investment grade. 

Short-Term Borrowings 

As part of our regular funding strategy, we may from time to time borrow short-term funds in the federal funds market or the repurchase ("repo") market through repurchase agreements. Federal funds are short-term, unsecured loans between banks or other financial entities with a Federal Reserve account. Funds borrowed in the repo market are short-term, collateralized loans, usually secured with highly-rated investment securities such as United States Treasury bills or notes, or mortgage bonds or debentures issued by government agencies or U.S. GSEs. At March 31, 2021, there were no outstanding balances in the federal funds market or under repurchase agreements. Additionally, the FHLB of Chicago offers short-term advance structures that we may use for short-term liquidity needs. At March 31, 2021, there were no outstanding short-term advances from the FHLB. 

Additional Funding Sources 

Private Asset-Backed Securitizations 

We have access to committed borrowing capacity through privately placed asset-backed securitizations. At March 31, 2021, we had total committed capacity of $6.0 billion, none of which was drawn. While we may utilize funding from these private securitizations from time to time for normal business operations, their committed nature also makes them a reliable contingency funding source. Therefore, we reserve some undrawn capacity, informed by our liquidity stress test results, for potential contingency funding needs. We also seek to ensure the stability and reliability of these securitizations by staggering their maturity dates, renewing them approximately one year prior to their scheduled maturity dates and periodically drawing them for operational tests and for seasonal funding needs. 

Federal Reserve 

Discover Bank has access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's discount window. As of March 31, 2021, Discover Bank had $32.5 billion of available borrowing capacity through the discount window based on the amount and type of assets pledged, primarily consumer loans. We have no borrowings outstanding under the discount window and reserve this capacity as a source of contingent liquidity. 

Funding Uses 

Our primary uses of funds include the extensions of loans and credit, primarily through Discover Bank; the purchase of investment securities for our liquidity portfolio; working capital; and debt and capital service. We assess funding uses and liquidity needs under stressed and normal operating conditions, considering primary uses of funding, such as on-balance sheet loans, and contingent uses of funding, such as the need to post additional collateral for derivatives positions. In order to anticipate funding needs under stress, we conduct liquidity stress tests to assess the impact of idiosyncratic, systemic and hybrid (idiosyncratic and systemic) scenarios with varying levels of liquidity risk reflecting a range of stress severity.

Credit Ratings 

Our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including those for securitizations and unsecured senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of DFS, Discover Bank and the securitization trusts. Downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations, as well as higher credit enhancement requirements for both our public and private asset securitizations. In addition to increased funding costs, deterioration in credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. 

When the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in 2020, rating agencies cited their expectation that the banking industry would experience heightened loan delinquencies and charge-offs from deterioration in the labor market. During the second quarter of 2020, Moody&#8217;s, Standard and Poor&#8217;s and Fitch Ratings affirmed our credit ratings. Standard and Poor&#8217;s and Fitch changed the outlook on Discover Financial Services' and Discover Bank's senior unsecured credit ratings from &#8220;stable,&#8221; to &#8220;negative,&#8221; while Moody&#8217;s retained a &#8220;stable,&#8221; outlook on the credit ratings of each. On March 25, 2021, Standard and Poor's upgraded the outlook on Discover Financial Services' and Discover Bank's senior unsecured debt from "negative" to "stable," recognizing better-than-expected operating performance in 2020 and our strong loss-absorbing capacity. For similar reasons, on May 3, 2021, Fitch Ratings also affirmed the credit ratings on Discover Financial Services' and Discover Bank's senior unsecured debt and revised its outlook on those ratings from "negative" to "stable." The table below reflects our current credit ratings and outlooks. Moody's Investors Service Standard &#38; Poor's Fitch Ratings Discover Financial Services Senior unsecured debt Baa3 BBB- BBB+ Outlook for Discover Financial Services senior unsecured debt Stable Stable Stable Discover Bank Senior unsecured debt Baa2 BBB BBB+ Outlook for Discover Bank senior unsecured debt Stable Stable Stable Subordinated debt Baa3 BBB- BBB Discover Card Execution Note Trust

(1) An "sf" in the rating denotes rating agency identification for structured finance product ratings. 

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. A credit rating outlook reflects an agency's opinion regarding the likely rating direction over the medium term, often a period of about a year, but also indicates the agency's belief that the issuer's credit profile is consistent with its current rating level at that point in time. 

Liquidity 

We seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under stressed and normal operating conditions. In addition to the funding sources discussed in the previous section, we also maintain highly liquid, unencumbered assets in our liquidity portfolio that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using either the repo market or outright sales. 

We maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy, which outlines the overall framework and general principles we follow in managing liquidity risk across our business. The policy is approved by the Board of Directors with implementation responsibilities delegated to the Asset and Liability Management Committee (the "ALCO"). Additionally, we maintain a liquidity management framework document, which outlines the general strategies, objectives and principles we utilize to manage our liquidity position and the various liquidity risks inherent in our business model. We seek to balance the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which may be costly, with having too little liquidity, which could cause financial distress. Liquidity risk is centrally managed by the ALCO, which is chaired by our Treasurer and has cross-functional membership. The ALCO monitors the liquidity risk profiles of DFS and Discover Bank and oversees any actions Corporate Treasury may take to ensure that we maintain ready access to our funding sources and sufficient liquidity to meet 

Table of Contents 

current and projected needs. In addition, the ALCO and our Board of Directors regularly review our compliance with our liquidity limits at DFS and Discover Bank, which are established in accordance with the liquidity risk appetite set by our Board of Directors. 

We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We utilize early warning indicators ("EWIs") to detect emerging liquidity stress events and a reporting and escalation process that is designed to be consistent with regulatory guidance. The EWIs include both idiosyncratic and systemic measures and are monitored on a daily basis and reported to the ALCO regularly. A warning from one or more of these indicators triggers prompt review and decision-making by our senior management team and, in certain instances, may lead to the convening of a senior-level response team and activation of our contingency funding plan. 

In addition, we conduct liquidity stress tests regularly and ensure contingency funding is in place to address potential liquidity shortfalls. We evaluate a range of stress scenarios that are designed in accordance with regulatory requirements, including idiosyncratic, systemic and a combination of such events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs. These scenarios measure the projected liquidity position at DFS and Discover Bank across a range of time horizons by comparing estimated contingency funding needs to available contingent liquidity. 

Our primary contingent liquidity sources include our liquidity portfolio securities, which we could sell, repo or borrow against, and private securitizations with unused borrowing capacity. In addition, we could borrow FHLB advances by pledging securities to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago. Moreover, we have unused borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve discount window, which provides an additional source of contingent liquidity. We seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations for at least 12 months in a severe stress environment. In such an environment, we may also take actions to curtail the size of our balance sheet, which would reduce the need for funding and liquidity. 

At March 31, 2021, our liquidity portfolio is comprised of highly liquid, unencumbered assets, including cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Cash and cash equivalents were primarily in the form of deposits with the Federal Reserve and United States Treasury bills. Investment securities primarily included debt obligations of the United States Treasury and residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") issued by United States government agencies or U.S. GSEs. These investments are considered highly liquid and we expect to have the ability to raise cash by selling them, utilizing repurchase agreements or pledging certain of these investments to access secured funding. The size and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the size of our balance sheet as well as operational requirements, market conditions and interest rate risk management policies. For instance, our liquidity portfolio grew during 2020 as our customer deposits increased and our loan balances declined, reflecting consumers&#8217; response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our liquidity portfolio continued to grow in the first quarter of 2021 due to net principal repayments on loan receivables resulting from elevated customer payment rates, which was driven by the latest round of government stimulus and the associated improvement in household cash flows. 

Table of Contents 

At March 31, 2021, our liquidity portfolio and undrawn credit facilities were $67.8 billion, which was $4.4 billion higher than the balance at December 31, 2020. During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the average balance of our liquidity portfolio was $28.2 billion and $24.6 billion, respectively.

Bank Holding Company Liquidity 

The primary uses of funds at the unconsolidated DFS level include debt service obligations (interest payments and return of principal) and capital service and management activities, which include dividend payments on capital instruments and the periodic repurchase of shares of our common stock. Our primary sources of funds at the bank holding company level include the proceeds from the issuance of unsecured debt and capital securities, as well as dividends from our subsidiaries, particularly Discover Bank. Under periods of idiosyncratic or systemic stress, the bank holding company could lose or experience impaired access to the capital markets. In addition, our regulators have the discretion to restrict dividend payments from Discover Bank to the bank holding company. 

We utilize a measure referred to as "Number of Months of Pre-Funding" to determine the length of time Discover Financial Services can meet upcoming funding obligations including common and preferred stock dividend payments and debt service obligations using existing cash resources. In managing this metric, we structure our debt maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time. See Note 7: Long-Term Borrowings to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt. 

Capital 

Our primary sources of capital are the earnings generated by our businesses and the proceeds from issuances of capital securities. We seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the growth and risks of our businesses and to meet regulatory requirements, rating agency targets and debt investor expectations. Within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that provides attractive returns to our stockholders. The level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments. 

Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, DFS, along with Discover Bank, must maintain minimum levels of capital. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a direct material effect on our financial condition and operating results. We must meet specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, as calculated under regulatory guidance and regulations. Current or future legislative or regulatory reforms, such as the adoption of the CECL accounting model, may require us to hold more capital or adversely impact our capital level. We consider the potential impacts of these reforms in managing our capital position. 

Table of Contents 

DFS and Discover Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that became effective January 2015 under final rules issued by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to implement the provisions under the Basel Committee's December 2010 framework ("Basel III rules"). The Basel III rules require DFS and Discover Bank to maintain minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios and define what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios. Under Basel III rules for regulatory capital, DFS and Discover Bank are classified as "Standardized Approach" entities, defined as United States banking organizations with consolidated total assets over $50 billion but not exceeding $250 billion and consolidated total on-balance sheet foreign exposures less than $10 billion. 

Thresholds within the Basel III rules were fully phased in as of January 1, 2019, with the exception of certain transition provisions that were frozen pursuant to regulations issued in November 2017. Pursuant to a final rule issued in July 2019, the transition provisions that were previously frozen will be replaced with new permanent thresholds as discussed below. Additionally, on March 27, 2020, federal bank regulatory agencies announced an interim and now final rule that allows banks that have implemented the CECL accounting model to delay the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. For purposes of calculating regulatory capital, we have elected to defer recognition of the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for two years in accordance with the final rule; after that period of deferral, the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital will be phased in over a three-year period beginning in 2022. We estimate that electing this option raised our Common Equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratios in 2020 and 2021. For additional information regarding the risk-based capital and leverage ratios, see Note 12: Capital Adequacy to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced the SCB final rule, which imposes limitations on our capital distributions if we do not maintain our capital ratios above stated regulatory minimum ratios based on the results of supervisory stress tests. We participated in the CCAR supervisory stress test in 2020 and received our SCB of 3.5%, which primarily reflects the difference between our actual CET1 ratio as of the fourth quarter of 2019 and our projected minimum CET1 ratio based on the Federal Reserve&#8217;s models in its nine-quarter Severely Adverse stress scenario. The SCB became effective October 1, 2020. Under this rule, we are required to assess whether our planned capital actions are consistent with the effective capital distributions limitations that will apply on a pro-forma basis throughout the planning horizon. In December 2020, the Federal Reserve notified Discover Bank and other large banks that it reserves the right to recalculate their SCBs based on the results of the most recent round of capital stress tests. On March 25, 2021, the Federal Reserve extended the right to recalculate Discover's SCBs through June 30, 2021. See "&#8212; Regulatory Environment and Developments &#8212; Banking &#8212; Capital Standards and Stress Testing" for additional information. 

The Basel III rules provide for certain threshold-based deductions from and adjustments to CET1 to the extent that any one such category or all such categories in the aggregate exceed certain percentages of CET1. In July 2019, federal banking regulators issued a final rule that, among other things, revised certain capital requirements for Standardized Approach banks by raising the 10% of CET1 deduction threshold for certain items to 25% and eliminating the 15% combined deduction threshold applying to these items. These changes became effective for all Standardized Approach banking institutions in April 2020. 

Basel III rules also require disclosures relating to market discipline. This series of disclosures is commonly referred to as "Pillar 3." The objective is to increase transparency of capital requirements for banking organizations. We are required to make prescribed regulatory disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding our capital structure, capital adequacy, risk exposures and risk-weighted assets. We make the Pillar 3 disclosures publicly available on our website in a report called "Basel III Regulatory Capital Disclosures." 

At March 31, 2021, DFS and Discover Bank met the requirements for "well-capitalized" status under Regulation Y and the prompt corrective action rules, respectively, exceeding the regulatory minimums to which they were subject under the applicable rules. Additionally, we are subject to regulatory requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve as part of its stress testing framework and CCAR program. Refer to "&#8212; Regulatory Environment and Developments" for more information. 

We disclose tangible common equity, which represents common equity less goodwill and intangibles. Management believes that common stockholders' equity excluding goodwill and intangibles is meaningful to investors as a measure of our true net asset value. As of March 31, 2021, tangible common equity is not formally defined by GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, as such, is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Other financial services companies may also disclose this measure and definitions may vary, so we advise users of this information to exercise caution in comparing this measure for different companies.

Discover is required to submit a capital plan as part of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s CCAR process. On April 5, 2021, we submitted our annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve covering the period January 1, 2021, to March 31, 2023. Discover is not subject to the supervisory stress test in 2021 and will next be a full CCAR participant in 2022. 

Our Board of Directors declared common stock dividends during 2021 and 2020 as follows: Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date Dividend per Share 2021 January 19, 2021 February 18, 2021 March 04, 2021 $ 0.44 2020 October 20, 2020 November 19, 2020 December 3, 2020 $ 0.44 July 21, 2020 August 20, 2020 September 3, 2020 $ 0.44 April 21, 2020 May 21, 2020 June 4, 2020 $ 0.44 January 21, 2020 February 20, 2020 March 5, 2020 $ 0.44 

In light of the current economic downturn, the Federal Reserve required all large banks participating in the CCAR supervisory stress test to cap common stock dividends at the lower of the prior quarter's dividend or the average of a firm&#8217;s net income over the preceding four quarters. 

Our Board of Directors declared Series C preferred stock dividends during 2021 and 2020 as follows: Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date Dividend per Depositary Share 2021 January 19, 2021 April 15, 2021 April 30, 2021 $ 27.50 2020 July 21, 2020 October 15, 2020 October 30, 2020 $ 27.50 January 21, 2020 April 15, 2020 April 30, 2020 $ 27.50

Our Board of Directors declared Series D preferred stock dividends during 2021 and 2020 as follows: Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date Dividend per Depositary Share 2021 

January 19, 2021 (1) 

March 08, 2021 March 23, 2021 $ 46.11 

(1) The dividend includes $30.63 semi-annual dividend per depositary share plus $15.48 to account for the long first dividend period. 

In January 2021, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $1.1 billion of share repurchases. The program expires December 31, 2021.Our decision to repurchase additional shares of common stock will depend on our financial results, prevailing and expected economic conditions, potential regulatory limitations and other considerations. For example, the Federal Reserve is currently restricting CCAR banks from paying common stock dividends and share repurchases that would exceed an amount equal to the average of a firm&#8217;s net income over the preceding four calendar quarters. Share repurchases under the program may be made through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other purchases, including block trades, accelerated share repurchase transactions, or any combination of such methods. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for approximately $100 million. 

The amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors, such as the impact of CECL. The declaration and payment of future dividends, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. Holders of our shares of common stock are subject to the prior dividend rights of holders of our preferred stock or the depositary shares representing such preferred stock outstanding. No dividend may be declared or paid or set aside for payment on our common stock if full dividends have not been declared and paid on all outstanding shares of preferred stock in any dividend period. In addition, as noted above, banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases, including limitations on the extent our banking subsidiary can provide funds to us through dividends, loans or otherwise. Further, current or future regulatory reforms may require us to hold more capital or adversely impact our capital level. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends or repurchase any shares of our common stock in the future. 

Certain Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Guarantees 

Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying asset, liability, or equity security of a guaranteed party, rate or index. Also included in guarantees are contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entity's failure to perform under an agreement. Our guarantees relate to transactions processed on the Discover Network and certain transactions processed by PULSE and Diners Club. See Note 13: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees. 

Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments 

In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at March 31, 2021, which include deposits, long-term borrowings, operating lease obligations, interest payments on fixed-rate debt, purchase obligations and other liabilities were $101.3 billion. For a description of our contractual obligations, see our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments." 

We extend credit for consumer loans, primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards and certain other loan products, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. At March 31, 2021, our unused credit arrangements were approximately $218.8 billion. We can terminate substantially all of these arrangements at any time and therefore the arrangements do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The arrangements are periodically reviewed based on account usage, customer creditworthiness and loan qualification. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to
