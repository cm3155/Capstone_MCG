 Item 2. 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report. This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements, which speak to our expected business and financial performance, among other matters, contain words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "aim," "will," "may," "should," "could," "would," "likely," and similar expressions. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this quarterly report, and there is no undertaking to update or revise them as more information becomes available. 

The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 ("COVID-19") pandemic and measures taken to mitigate the pandemic, including their impact on our credit quality and business operations as well as their impact on general economic and financial markets, changes in economic variables, such as the availability of consumer credit, the housing market, energy costs, the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings, the rate of unemployment, the levels of consumer confidence and consumer debt and investor sentiment; the impact of current, pending and future legislation, regulation, supervisory guidance and regulatory and legal actions, including, but not limited to, those related to financial regulatory reform, consumer financial services practices, anti-corruption and funding, capital and liquidity; the actions and initiatives of current and potential competitors; our ability to manage our expenses; our ability to successfully achieve card acceptance across our networks and maintain relationships with network participants; our ability to sustain and grow our private student loan, personal loan and home equity loan products; difficulty obtaining regulatory approval for, financing, transitioning, integrating or managing the expenses of acquisitions of or investments in new businesses, products or technologies; our ability to manage our credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk and strategic risk; the availability and cost of funding and capital; access to deposit, securitization, equity, debt and credit markets; the impact of rating agency actions; the level and volatility of equity prices, commodity prices and interest rates, currency values, investments, other market fluctuations and other market indices; losses in our investment portfolio; limits on our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; limits on our ability to receive payments from our subsidiaries; fraudulent activities or material security breaches of key systems; our ability to remain organizationally effective; our ability to increase or sustain Discover card usage or attract new customers; our ability to maintain relationships with merchants; the effect of political, economic and market conditions, geopolitical events and unforeseen or catastrophic events; our ability to introduce new products and services; our ability to manage our relationships with third-party vendors; our ability to maintain current technology and integrate new and acquired systems; our ability to collect amounts for disputed transactions from merchants and merchant acquirers; our ability to attract and retain employees; our ability to protect our reputation and our intellectual property; and new lawsuits, investigations or similar matters or unanticipated developments related to current matters. We routinely evaluate and may pursue acquisitions of or investments in businesses, products, technologies, loan portfolios or deposits, which may involve payment in cash or our debt or equity securities. 

Additional factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those described below can be found in this section and in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part II of this quarterly report and in "Risk Factors," "Business &#8212; Competition," "Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 , which is filed with the SEC and available at the SEC's internet site (https://www.sec.gov). 

Introduction and Overview 

Discover Financial Services ("DFS") is a direct banking and payment services company. We provide direct banking products and services and payment services through our subsidiaries. We offer our customers credit card loans, private student loans, personal loans, home equity loans and deposit products. We also operate the Discover Network, the PULSE network ("PULSE") and Diners Club International ("Diners Club"). The Discover Network processes transactions for Discover-branded credit and debit cards and provides payment transaction processing and settlement services. PULSE operates an electronic funds transfer network, providing financial institutions issuing debit cards on the PULSE network with access to ATMs domestically and internationally, as well as merchant acceptance throughout the U.S. for debit card transactions. Diners Club is a global payments network of licensees, which are generally financial institutions, that issue Diners Club branded charge cards and/or provide card acceptance services. 

Our primary revenues consist of interest income earned on loan receivables and fees earned from customers, financial institutions, merchants and issuers. The primary expenses required to operate our business include funding costs (interest expense), credit loss provisions, customer rewards and expenses incurred to grow, manage and service our loan receivables and networks. Our business activities are funded primarily through consumer deposits, securitization of loan receivables and the issuance of unsecured debt. 

Change in Accounting Principle 

Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments became effective for us on January 1, 2020. The standard significantly amended accounting principles generally accepted in the United States by replacing the incurred loss model with the current expected credit loss ("CECL") approach. The CECL approach requires our allowance for credit losses to be based on an estimate of all anticipated credit losses over the remaining expected life of all of the loans, as opposed to an estimate of incurred losses as of the balance sheet date. For additional information on CECL, see Note 1: Background and Basis of Presentation to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

The ASU required modified-retrospective application, meaning a cumulative-effect adjustment was recorded on January 1, 2020 without adjusting comparative prior periods. This cumulative-effect adjustment did not reflect the economic disruption resulting from COVID-19 since the global disruption occurred subsequent to January 1, 2020. As a result of adoption, we recorded: 

&#8226; 

A $2.5 billion increase to the allowance for credit losses on loan receivables primarily representing the adjustment for recording reserves for expected losses, not simply those deemed to be already incurred, and extending the loss estimate period over the entire life of the loan; 

&#8226; 

A $0.6 billion increase to other assets related to deferred tax assets on the larger allowance for credit losses; 

&#8226; 

An offsetting $1.9 billion decrease, net of tax, to the opening balance of retained earnings; and 

&#8226; 

Immaterial adjustments to the following: 

&#9702; 

The carrying value of PCD loans and related accrued interest reflected in other assets; and 

&#9702; 

Accrued expenses and other liabilities to record reserves for unfunded commitments. 

As required by the ASU, financial statement results and balances prior to January 1, 2020 have not been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the amendments in ASU No. 2016-13. Therefore, current period results and balances are not comparable to prior period amounts, particularly with regard to the provision and allowance for credit losses (and their related subtotals). 

Additional Information for Comparability 

In order to help investors understand our year-over-year performance, we are providing adjusted prior year allowance for credit losses and related allowance build figures using the CECL approach for comparative purposes. These adjusted prior year figures are non-GAAP financial measures and should be viewed in addition to, not as a substitute for, our reported results. We believe that these adjusted figures are useful to investors since credit losses were estimated using the incurred loss approach prior to adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. The adjusted allowance and related build figures provide investors with comparable amounts to understand our results. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of prior year allowance for credit losses figures as reported (using the incurred loss approach) to adjusted allowance for credit losses using the CECL approach, as well as related allowance build figures (dollars in millions):

COVID-19 Pandemic Response and Impact 

The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to have a widespread and unprecedented impact on a global scale. The health crisis continues to have a severe effect on the economy. The impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve rapidly, its future effects are uncertain, and it may be difficult to assess or predict the extent of the impacts of the pandemic on us as many factors are beyond our control and knowledge. For a discussion of the risks we face with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, the associated economic uncertainty, the steps taken to mitigate the pandemic and the resulting economic contraction, see "Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors" in Part II of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which should be read in conjunction with the risk factors disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 . This section includes a discussion of significant areas of potential impact on us of the COVID-19 pandemic and certain actions we are taking or expect to take in this time of uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Outlook and Financial Results 

During the first half of the year, the pandemic has adversely impacted our financial results, specifically in the decrease in sales volume and credit card loan growth as well as the increase in our estimate of life of loan expected credit losses. As previously disclosed in the first quarter Form 10-Q, we continue to execute on our strategy to implement approximately $400 million of cost reductions off of previously provided guidance from the fourth quarter 2019 earnings release, targeting areas such as account acquisition costs and marketing expenses, due to the economic environment and the resulting pressure on earnings for the remainder of the year. Outbreaks of COVID-19 have resulted in state and local governments implementing, and in some cases re-implementing, measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions, shutdowns and quarantines. We anticipate these measures as well as the related economic uncertainty will continue to negatively impact consumer and business spending habits and the consumer credit environment, including the ability of consumers to repay their loans. While certain parts of the U.S. have begun to lift these measures, the re-emergence of COVID-19 has and may continue to result in governments re-imposing restrictions that may remain in place for a significant period of time. The economic uncertainty associated with COVID-19 and the measures taken to limit its spread have and will likely continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Regulatory and Legislative 

Federal, state and local governments, including the U.S. Congress, the Executive Branch, and banking agencies have taken extraordinary measures to support the U.S. economy and mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of measures taken to slow its spread. These policies have included efforts to provide regulatory relief and flexibility to financial institutions, liquidity to capital markets and mandates to support businesses and consumers, including stimulus checks, payment forbearance, and other forms of assistance. Lawmakers will likely continue to offer additional proposals as the situation evolves in an attempt to mitigate harm to the economy and consumers. It is too early to determine the overall 

effectiveness of actions that have been taken and their ultimate impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For more information, see &#8220;&#8212; Regulatory Environment and Developments&#8221; below. 

Loan Receivables 

In our loan portfolio, we continue to lend to customers, but have tightened standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts. Currently, we are providing support to our customers impacted by COVID-19 across all of our loan products, expanding payment plans notably through skip-a-pay programs, to help our customers during this period of economic difficulty. Skip-a-pay programs were intended to be a short-term option and we plan to end program enrollments in the near future. After that, we will continue to offer assistance to those who qualify on a customer-by-customer basis. We have materially increased our allowance for credit losses in anticipation of higher credit losses caused by further deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. The reserve build for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 took into account our best estimate for the impact of programs put in place by federal and state governments and agencies to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. It is unclear whether the measures employed to date are complete or whether federal and state governments and agencies may take additional action that could impact our business. Refer to "&#8212; Loan Quality &#8212; Impact of COVID-19 on Loan Quality" for more details on the current period allowance for credit losses. 

Capital and Liquidity 

We entered the COVID-19 pandemic with strong capital and liquidity positions, which we believe allows us to maintain normal operations during periods of financial market stress and disruptions to wholesale and retail funding sources. We believe we have a sufficient reserve of high-quality liquid assets and have been able to maintain access to diverse funding channels. We continued to see strong demand for our direct-to-consumer and sweep deposit balances as consumers savings rates have increased and investors sought safer assets. We remain well-capitalized with capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimums and have taken actions to preserve capital such as suspending our share repurchase program. For purposes of calculating regulatory capital, we have elected to defer recognition of the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for two years in accordance with the interim final rule announced by Federal banking regulators on March 27, 2020. Pursuant to the interim final rule, the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital will be phased in over a three-year period beginning in 2022. 

For more information on the impact of COVID-19 on liquidity and capital, see "&#8212; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8212; Impact of COVID-19 on Liquidity and Capital." 

Payment Services 

As governments across the U.S. and the world have taken steps to minimize the transmission of COVID-19, the number of transactions processed on the Discover Global Network has declined overall despite increases in certain categories. Certain negatively impacted categories such as travel make up a small portion of the transactions processed but may have an outsized impact on some of our Diners Club franchisees. The current crisis may result in lasting changes in consumer payment behaviors, such as a shift from credit to debit, a decline in the use of cash, increasing online sales and rapid adoption of contactless payment. These shifts may result in changes to the Payment Services segment&#8217;s results of operations. 

Fair Value and Impairments 

With the uncertain nature of the pandemic's overall impact to the economy, we continue to assess the impact of COVID-19 with respect to our goodwill and intangible assets, investment securities and other long-term assets. During the second quarter of 2020, we identified a triggering event due to changes in the international travel and entertainment businesses that continue to persist and a declining revenue outlook for the foreseeable future resulting from COVID-19. As a result, we conducted interim impairment testing of our non-amortizable intangible assets in the Payment Services segment and recognized impairment charges totaling $59 million. For more information on the impact of COVID-19 on intangible assets, see Note 5: Intangible Assets to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Business Continuity and Operations 

We have informed employees that they may continue to work from home and will not be required to return to our physical locations until January 1, 2021, at the earliest. Notwithstanding the shift to work-from-home, our operations continue largely unaffected due to the successful implementation of certain of our business continuity plans. Operational changes necessitated by the rapid shift in employee location have not thus far had a material adverse effect on us or our 

financial condition; however, the shift has caused us to grow increasingly dependent on third-party service providers, including those with which we have no relationship such as our employees&#8217; internet service providers. For more information on the risks associated with reliance on third-party service providers and the shift to work from home, see our risk factors disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 as well as "Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors" in Part II of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

Regulatory Environment and Developments 

The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted the U.S. and global economies. We are working with our customers to address their unique financial situations, while balancing safety and soundness requirements. We are in contact with our regulators, who have proactively encouraged banks to work with borrowers during this time of stress. Among other things, the federal banking agencies have taken the following actions to proactively address the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 outbreak and provide flexibility for banking organizations to work with impacted businesses and consumers: 

&#8226; 

Market Stabilization: The Federal Reserve reduced short-term interest rates to near zero and launched numerous programs and facilities, including the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, to increase market liquidity and promote stability; 

&#8226; 

Capital &#38; Liquidity Flexibility: Regulatory agencies issued statements urging banks to use their capital and liquidity buffers to continue lending during the crisis; 

&#8226; 

CECL: A joint agency interim final rule provided banks, such as Discover, with the option to delay CECL's impact on regulatory capital for two years, followed by three year phase-in of those impacts; 

&#8226; 

Flexibility to Work with Consumers: Joint agency guidance encouraged banks to work with borrowers and provided guidelines for prudent relief programs, and agencies worked with FASB to provide accounting-classification flexibility for certain short-term loan modifications; 

&#8226; 

Pandemic Planning: The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council released updated guidance to remind banks of actions they should be taking to minimize potential adverse effects of a pandemic on business continuity; and 

&#8226; 

Supervisory Flexibility: Regulatory agencies have indicated willingness to work with institutions to provide flexibility and minimize burdens of supervisory activities, including extending deadlines for data collections. 

In addition to the above regulatory actions, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") was signed into law on March 27, 2020 to provide relief to U.S. businesses and consumers impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. The CARES Act includes approximately $2 trillion of financial assistance, principally through federal loan programs intended to provide relief to consumers who have suffered job losses and aid businesses that have experienced disruption as a result of the pandemic. Additionally, the CARES Act provided expanded unemployment benefits and direct payments to impacted consumers and offered relief for consumers through changes to credit reporting requirements and mandated forbearance on certain federally backed mortgages and student loans. Specific to financial institutions, the CARES Act provided the option for financial institutions, including Discover, to temporarily suspend certain accounting requirements related to troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") and delay the effective date of CECL for the duration of the national emergency. See "&#8212; Banking &#8212; Capital Standards and Stress Testing" below for more information. It also authorized the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") to establish an emergency guarantee program, which could be used to temporarily increase deposit insurance limits. Additional legislative and regulatory action may be proposed and could include requirements that could significantly impact our business practices . The impact of these legislative and regulatory initiatives on us, the economy and the U.S. consumer will depend upon a wide variety of factors some of which are yet to be identified. 

Banking 

Capital Standards and Stress Testing 

Discover is subject to supervisory stress tests every other year rather than annually and is required to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve and subject to other core components of the enhanced prudential standards rules, such as risk management and risk committee requirements and liquidity risk management regulations. However, Discover is not required to submit company-run capital stress tests and is no longer subject to the liquidity coverage ratio. 

On June 25, 2020, we received results of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s supervisory stress tests and preliminary Stress Capital Buffer ("SCB") requirement. The notice indicated that Discover&#8217;s capital ratios remain above all required minimums under each of the supervisory scenarios and our preliminary SCB requirement was set at 3.5%, which is expected to be finalized in August and effective beginning October 1, 2020. In addition to the stress test and SCB results, the Federal Reserve also notified Discover that it and all other firms that participated in the 2020 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review exercise would be required to submit a revised capital plan that will be assessed by the Federal Reserve later this year under newly developed scenarios incorporating economic stresses reflecting the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the interim, the Federal Reserve has capped covered firms&#8217; capital distributions based on a formula that restricts most share repurchases and limits dividends based on average net income during the past four quarters. Consistent with regulatory expectations, our management also continues to conduct forward-looking sensitivity analysis and stress tests to assess the potential impact of economic changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic on capital planning and provides this information to our Board of Directors as well as our regulators. 

LIBOR 

On July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer encourage or compel banks to continue to contribute quotes and maintain the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") after 2021. LIBOR is commonly used as a benchmark to determine interest rates for financial instruments, such as floating-rate asset-backed securities issued by Discover Card Execution Note Trust, and certain financial products, including some of our floating-rate student loans. A cross-functional team is overseeing and managing our transition away from the use of LIBOR. This team monitors developments associated with LIBOR alternatives, assesses evolving industry and marketplace norms and conventions for LIBOR indexed instruments, evaluates the impact that the inability to determine LIBOR after 2021 will have on us, and facilitates the operational changes associated with the use of alternative benchmark rates. On June 4, 2020, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (&#8220;NPR&#8221;) concerning the anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR. This NPR sets forth amendments to Regulation Z, the implementing regulation for the Truth in Lending Act, and includes proposed examples of replacement indices for LIBOR that meet Regulation Z standards for open- and closed-end products. Discover is monitoring the evolution of this NPR and will take into account the provisions of any related Final Rule in our efforts to transition away from the use of LIBOR. 

Consumer Financial Services 

The CFPB regulates consumer financial products and services, and examines certain providers of consumer financial products and services, including Discover. The CFPB's authority includes preventing "unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices" and ensuring that consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive financial products and services. The CFPB has rulemaking, supervision and enforcement powers with respect to federal consumer protection laws. Historically, the CFPB's policy priorities focused on several financial products of the type we offer (e.g. credit cards and other consumer lending products). In addition, the CFPB is required by statute to undertake certain actions including its bi-annual review of the consumer credit card market. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal banking regulators as well as the CFPB have encouraged banks to work with their borrowers and provided regulatory flexibility, given exam flexibility, delayed the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and other data collections, and promoted other areas for relief. Similar to the banking regulators, we continue to be in regular contact with the CFPB as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. Similarly, we are monitoring the activity in the states and are in contact with state officials, as necessary, to ensure we are aware of and in compliance with state requirements responding to COVID-19. 

Data Security and Privacy 

Policymakers at the federal and state levels remain focused on measures to enhance data security and data breach incident response requirements. Furthermore, regulations and legislation at various levels of government have been proposed and enacted to augment data privacy standards. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") creates a broad set of privacy rights and remedies modeled in part on the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and proposed regulations have yet to be finalized. California Attorney General Enforcement for CCPA began on July 1, 2020. The original proponent of the CCPA has launched a 2020 California ballot initiative with the goal of expanding the rights and remedies created by the CCPA, while protecting the new law from future legislative amendments. This initiative will appear on the November 2020 ballot. While it is too early to determine the full impact of these developments, they may result in the imposition of requirements on Discover and other providers of consumer financial services or networks that could adversely affect our businesses. 

Payment Networks 

The Dodd-Frank Act contains several provisions impacting the debit card market, including network participation requirements and interchange fee limitations. The changing debit card environment, including competitor actions related to merchant and acquirer pricing and transaction routing strategies, has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our PULSE network's business practices, network transaction volume, revenue and prospects for future growth. We continue to closely monitor competitor pricing and technology development strategies in order to assess their impact on our business and on competition in the marketplace. Following an inquiry by the U.S. Department of Justice into some of these competitor pricing strategies, PULSE filed a lawsuit against Visa in late 2014 with respect to these competitive concerns. The Court granted summary judgment in favor of Visa in August 2018. PULSE filed an appeal on January 17, 2019 and Visa filed their response to the appeal on April 5, 2019. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held a hearing on the appeal on October 9, 2019 and will hold an additional hearing on the appeal in the coming months. Visa also faces ongoing merchant litigation as it relates to the underlying anticompetitive behavior that is the subject of PULSE's case against Visa. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act's network participation requirements impact PULSE's ability to enter into exclusivity arrangements, which affects PULSE's current business practices and may materially adversely affect its network transaction volume and revenue. 

For more information on how the regulatory and supervisory environment, ongoing enforcement actions and findings, and changes to laws and regulations could impact our strategies, the value of our assets, or otherwise adversely affect our business see "Risk Factors &#8212; Current Economic and Regulatory Environment" in our annual report on Form 10-K year ended December 31, 2019 . For more information on recent matters affecting us, see Note 14: Litigation and Regulatory Matters to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Segments 

We manage our business activities in two segments, Direct Banking and Payment Services, based on the products and services provided. For a detailed description of the operations of each segment, as well as the allocation conventions used in our business segment reporting, see Note 17: Segment Disclosures to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Direct Banking 

Our Direct Banking segment reported pretax losses of $484 million and $645 million , respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to pretax income of $941 million and $1.8 billion , respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 . 

Net interest income decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily driven by lower yields on credit card loans partially offset by lower funding costs. Interest income decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019 as a result of lower yields on credit card loans, which was the result of lower market rates. Interest expense decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019 due to lower funding costs and lower average market rates. 

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , the provision for credit losses increased as compared to the same periods in 2019 , which, in addition to the impact of life of loan reserving under CECL, primarily reflects a significant change in economic outlook due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For a detailed discussion on provision for credit losses, see "&#8212; Loan Quality &#8212; Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses." 

Total other income decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019 , which was primarily due to a decrease in net discount and interchange revenue and loan fee income. The decrease in discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by a decrease in rewards costs, both of which were the result of lower sales volume due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Loan fee income decreased due to lower sales volume and late fees. Sales volume was lower driven by the COVID-19 impacts. Late fees decreased as a result of lower delinquencies as we continue to work with our customers through the economic stresses from COVID-19. 

Total other expense decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, which was primarily due to marketing and business development driven by COVID-19 related expense reductions in brand advertising for card. Total other expense increased for the six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, which was primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefits driven by a larger headcount base and higher average salaries. 

Discover card sales volume was $30.7 billion and $64.7 billion , respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , which was a decrease of 16.2% and 7.0% , respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2019 . This volume decline was primarily driven by lower consumer spending as a result of COVID-19. 

Payment Services 

Our Payment Services segment reported pretax income of $23 million and $106 million , respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to pretax income of $46 million and $97 million , respectively, for the same periods in 2019 . The increase in segment pretax income was primarily due to gains on equity investment sales during each quarter. Other expense increased primarily due to a non-cash impairment charge on the Diners Club business of $59 million driven by changes in the international travel and entertainment businesses that continue to persist and a declining revenue outlook for the foreseeable future resulting from COVID-19 . 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain. For estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity, it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period. For estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions, significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our condensed consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain cases, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition. Management has identified the estimates related to our allowance for credit losses on loan receivables, the evaluation of goodwill for potential impairment and the accrual of income taxes as critical accounting estimates. Discussion of critical accounting estimates related to the evaluation of goodwill for potential impairment and the accrual of income taxes are discussed in greater detail in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 . That discussion can be found within "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Critical Accounting Estimates." There have not been any material changes in the methods used to formulate these critical accounting estimates related to the evaluation of goodwill for potential impairment and the accrual of income taxes from those discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 . Discussion of our critical accounting estimate related to our allowance for credit losses on loan receivables, which has been updated for adoption of the CECL approach for estimating losses on January 1, 2020, is discussed below. For more information on CECL adoption, see Note 1: Background and Basis of Presentation to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loan Receivables 

We base our allowance for credit losses on several analyses that help us estimate credit losses anticipated over the remaining expected life of loan receivables as of the balance sheet date. In deriving this estimate, we consider the collectibility of principal, interest and fees associated with our loan receivables. We also consider expected recoveries of amounts that were either previously charged off or are expected to be charged off. Our estimation process includes models that predict customer losses based on risk characteristics and portfolio attributes, macroeconomic variables, and historical data and analysis. There is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced to determine the allowance. The allowance for credit losses for each loan product type is based on: 1) a reasonable and supportable forecast period, 2) a reversion period and 3) a post-reversion period based on historical information covering the remaining life of the loan. For credit card loans, we use a modeling framework that includes the following components: 1) probability of default, 2) exposure at default and 3) loss given default, as well as estimated recoveries for estimating expected credit losses. For student loans and personal loans, we use vintage-based models that estimate expected credit losses net of recoveries over the life of the loans. The considerations in these models include past and current loan performance, loan growth and seasoning, risk management practices, account collection strategies, economic conditions, bankruptcy filings, policy changes and forecasting uncertainties. Given the same information, others may reach different reasonable estimates. 

The key assumptions requiring significant judgment in the allowance for credit losses estimate on a quarterly basis include determination of the lengths of the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods, as well as the macroeconomic variables selected for use in loss forecast models. The lengths of the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods can vary and are subject to a quarterly assessment that considers the economic outlook and level of variability among macroeconomic forecasts. Generally, a straight-line method is used to revert from the reasonable and 

supportable forecast period to the post-reversion period, but in certain stressed scenarios, a weighted approach may be deemed more appropriate. The specific macroeconomic variables most significant to the loss forecast models may change over time, but generally include measures of consumer indebtedness, unemployment, personal income and housing-related metrics. 

The overall economic environment directly impacts both the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods, as well as the macroeconomic variables that are used in the loss forecast models. If management used different assumptions about the economic environment in estimating expected credit losses, the impact to the allowance for credit losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we experience a rapidly changing economic environment, as experienced recently under the COVID-19 pandemic, the uncertainty around the credit loss forecasts may increase, both due to the uncertainty of the economic forecasts and the challenges our models may have in incorporating them. Although the estimation process is broader than any single macroeconomic variable, some variables have a more significant impact on the allowance for credit losses estimate. One example is a macroeconomic forecast reflecting a 25 basis point change in the Unemployment Rate variable, which could move the card allowance for credit losses estimate by approximately $190 million . See "&#8212; Loan Quality" and Note 3: Loan Receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further details about our allowance for credit losses.

Prior to adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, credit losses were estimated using the incurred loss approach. 

Net Interest Income 

The table that follows this section has been provided to supplement the discussion below and provide further analysis of net interest income and net interest margin. Net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets. We analyze net interest income in total by calculating net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total loan receivables) and net yield on interest-earning assets (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets). We also separately consider the impact of the level of loan receivables and the related interest yield and the impact of the cost of funds related to each of our funding sources, along with the income generated by our liquidity portfolio, on net interest income. 

Our interest-earning assets consist of: (i) cash and cash equivalents primarily related to amounts on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, (ii) restricted cash, (iii) other short-term investments, (iv) investment securities and (v) loan receivables. Our interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits, both direct-to-consumer and brokered, and long-term borrowings, including amounts owed to securitization investors. Net interest income is influenced by the following: 

&#8226; 

The level and composition of loan receivables, including the proportion of credit card loans to other loans, as well as the proportion of loan receivables bearing interest at promotional rates as compared to standard rates; 

&#8226; 

The credit performance of our loans, particularly with regard to charge-offs of finance charges, which reduce interest income; 

&#8226; 

The terms of long-term borrowings and certificates of deposit upon initial offering, including maturity and interest rate; 

&#8226; 

The interest rates necessary to attract and maintain direct-to-consumer deposits; 

&#8226; 

The level and composition of other interest-earning assets, including our liquidity portfolio and interest-bearing liabilities; 

&#8226; 

Changes in the interest rate environment, including the levels of interest rates and the relationships among interest rate indices, such as the prime rate, the Federal Funds rate, interest rate on excess reserves and LIBOR; and 

&#8226; 

The effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program. 

Net interest income decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily driven by lower yields on credit card loans partially offset by lower funding costs. Interest income decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019 as a result of lower yields on credit card loans, which was the result of lower market rates. Interest expense decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019 due to lower funding costs and lower average market rates.

Loan Quality 

Impact of COVID-19 on Loan Quality 

COVID-19 and its impact to the economy has had a significant effect on our sales volume and loan growth during the first half of 2020. Also, while we continue to lend to customers, we have tightened standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts. 

We continue to provide support to our customers impacted by COVID-19. In response to the pandemic, to complement the assistance already available through our existing programs, we expanded borrower relief offerings to also include skip-a-pay programs and other loan modifications. The accounts using these modifications are generally excluded from TDR status either because the concessions are insignificant or they qualify for exemption pursuant to the CARES Act or interagency guidance. 

As of June 30, 2020, we have enrolled approximately 650 thousand customers and $5.2 billion in receivables in skip-a-pay programs in total. Of those customers and receivables, 88 thousand and $1.0 billion , respectively, were still enrolled at quarter-end. We have seen skip-a-pay enrollments in our card portfolio steadily decrease after peak enrollment during the first week of April. The utilization of skip-a-pay programs has had a favorable impact on reported credit performance because, pursuant to regulatory guidelines, accounts enrolled in the programs do not advance through delinquency cycles in the same time frame as would have occurred without the programs. Specifically, current accounts enrolled in the programs do not advance to delinquency, and delinquent accounts enrolled in the programs do not advance to the next delinquency cycle, or to charge-off. At June 30, 2020, our delinquency ratios have been favorably impacted by customer usage of the skip-a-pay programs and are lower than comparative periods as a result . 

Additionally, due to relief provided by the CARES Act or interagency guidance, certain customer accounts entering loan modification programs during the pandemic were excluded from being reported as TDRs. As a result, fewer modifications were reported as TDRs at June 30, 2020 than otherwise would have been. The table below reflects both the new modifications reported as TDRs and the amount of new modifications excluded from TDR classification as a result of regulatory relief (dollars in millions):

&#160; 

Despite the lower delinquency and TDR trends resulting from the relief we are providing to our customers, we believe we have appropriately reflected the risk presented by the accounts using these programs as well as the worsening economic impact of the pandemic on our customers in the allowance for credit losses. The increases in the allowance for credit losses during the first half of 2020 are indicative of the deterioration in consumer credit we expect related to the pandemic. The year-to-date build in the allowance of $4.8 billion is largely comprised of card loans but includes increases across all loan products. Labor markets, historically indicative of trends in credit losses, have been significantly stressed by the pandemic with unemployment reaching unprecedented levels. The higher allowance for credit losses reflects our view of this economic impact on our customers. Refer to Note 3: Loan Receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more details on modification programs, troubled debt restructurings, and the allowance for credit losses.

Prior to adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, credit losses were estimated using the incurred loss approach. 

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimate of credit losses anticipated over the remaining expected life of loan receivables at each period end date. In deriving the estimate of expected credit losses, we consider the collectibility of principal, interest and fees associated with our loan receivables. We also consider expected recoveries of amounts that were either previously charged off or are expected to be charged off. Establishing the estimate for expected losses requires significant management judgment. The factors that influence the provision for credit losses include: 

&#8226; 

Increases or decreases in outstanding loan balances, including: 

&#9702; 

Changes in consumer spending, payment and credit utilization behaviors; 

&#9702; 

The level of originations and maturities; and 

&#9702; 

Changes in the overall mix of accounts and products within the portfolio; 

&#8226; 

The credit quality of the loan portfolio, which reflects, among other factors, our credit granting practices and the effectiveness of collection efforts; 

&#8226; 

The impact of general economic conditions on the consumer, including national and regional conditions, unemployment levels, bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements; 

&#8226; 

The level and direction of historical losses; and 

&#8226; 

Regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance. 

For more details on how we estimate the allowance for credit losses, refer to "&#8212; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses on Loan Receivables" and Note 3: Loan Receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

(1) 

Excludes an $8 million build and $23 million release of the liability for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, as the liability is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. 

(2) 

Prior to adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, credit losses were estimated using the incurred loss approach. 

(3) 

Prior to adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, net charge-offs on PCD loans generally did not result in a charge to earnings. 

(4) 

Net change in reserves on PCD pools having no remaining non-accretable difference (prior to adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2020). 

(5) 

Represents the adjustment to allowance for credit losses as a result of adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. 

The allowance for credit losses was $8.2 billion at June 30, 2020 , which reflects a $4.8 billion build over the amount of the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2019 . The allowance build across all loan products was due to (I) a $2.5 billion cumulative-effect adjustment for the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 and (II) a $2.3 billion build during the period that primarily reflects an economic outlook with updated assumptions about the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic. In estimating the allowance at June 30, 2020 , we used a macroeconomic forecast that assumes a peak unemployment rate of 16%, recovering to just under 11% at the end of 2020 with slow recovery over the next few years, and an annualized real Gross Domestic Product decline of approximately 30% quarter-over-quarter or down approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis. The estimate also contemplated the impact of government stimulus programs and company-initiated loan modification programs on borrower payment behavior. The impact of COVID-19 on the economy has led to uncertainty in assumptions surrounding factors such as the length and depth of economic stresses and borrower behavior, which required significant management judgment in estimating the allowance for credit losses. 

Company-initiated loan modification programs include those offered specifically in response to COVID-19 as well as existing programs offered to customers experiencing difficulty making their payments. In addition to skip-a-pay programs, we have other modification programs that customers have utilized during the period related to the pandemic. The accounts using these modifications are generally excluded from TDR status either because the concessions are insignificant or they qualify for exemption pursuant to the CARES Act or interagency guidance. All modifications are considered as part of the process for determining the allowance for credit losses. 

At adoption of CECL and at June 30, 2020 , the forecast period management deemed to be reasonable and supportable was 18 months . This period decreased to 12 months at March 31, 2020 due to the uncertainty caused by the rapidly changing 

economic environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the second quarter, the reasonable and supportable period was 18 months based on the view that the present macroeconomic conditions will last for a longer period than previously expected. For both quarters, the reversion period was 12 months . Since adoption of CECL, a straight-line method was used to revert to appropriate historical information. During the quarter ended June 30, 2020, the high degree of economic stress led us to apply a weighted reversion method for credit card loans that puts more emphasis on the loss forecast model rather than lower historical losses. At June 30, 2020, the reversion method remained straight-line for all other products. 

The provision for credit losses is the amount of expense realized after considering the level of net charge-offs in the period and the required amount of allowance for credit losses at the balance sheet date. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , the provision for credit losses increased by $1.3 billion or 159% , and $2.3 billion or 143% , respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2019 . The allowance build was determined under separate methodologies for each period, based on the timing of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2020; however, the largest driver of the increase in provision between the two periods was the significant change in economic outlook due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Net Charge-offs 

Our net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude charged-off and recovered interest and fees and fraud losses. Charged-off and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest income and loan fee income, respectively, which is effectively a reclassification of the provision for credit losses, while fraud losses are recorded in other expense.

(1) 

Prior to adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, net charge-offs on PCD loans generally did not result in a charge to earnings. 

The net charge-off rate on our credit card loans increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019 due to seasoning of recent years' loan growth. The net charge-off rate on our private student loans remained relatively flat for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019 . The net charge-off rate on our personal loans decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019 due to improved underwriting. 

Delinquencies 

Delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at a point in time. A loan balance is considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become 30 days past due. 

The following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of key loan products that are 30 and 90 days or more delinquent, loans that are not accruing interest regardless of delinquency, and loans restructured in TDR programs (dollars in millions):

(1) 

Includes PCD loans for all periods presented. 

(2) 

We estimate that interest income recognized on credit card loans restructured in TDR programs was $60 million and $82 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively, and $131 million and $152 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. We do not separately track interest income on loans in TDR programs. This amount was estimated by applying an average interest rate to the average loans in the various TDR programs. 

(3) 

We estimate that the gross interest income that would have been recorded in accordance with the original terms of credit card loans restructured in TDR programs was $47 million and $50 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively, and $101 million and $95 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. We do not separately track the amount of additional gross interest income that would have been recorded if the loans in TDR programs had not been restructured and interest had instead been recorded in accordance with the original terms. This amount was estimated by applying the difference between the average interest rate earned on non-modified loans and the average interest rate earned on loans in the TDR programs to the average loans in the TDR programs. 

(4) 

Credit card loans restructured in TDR programs include $131 million and $184 million at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively, which are also included in loans 90 or more days delinquent. 

(5) 

Beginning in 2020, credit card accounts of borrowers that have previously participated in a temporary interest rate reduction program and that have both demonstrated financial stability and had their charging privileges reinstated at a market-based interest rate, are no longer included in the balance of TDRs. 

(6) 

Private student loans restructured in TDR programs include $8 million and $10 million at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively, which are also included in loans 90 or more days delinquent. 

(7) 

Personal loans restructured in TDR programs include $7 million at both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , which are also included in loans 90 or more days delinquent. 

The 30- day as well as 90-day delinquency rates for credit card loans at June 30, 2020 decreased c ompared to December 31, 2019 primarily due to the impact of skip-a-pay relief programs. The 30-day and 90-day delinquency rates for private student loans at June 30, 2020 decreased c ompared to December 31, 2019 primarily due to seasonality of the loan portfolio. The 30-day and 90-day delinquency rates for personal loans at June 30, 2020 decreased c ompared to December 31, 2019 as a result of improved underwriting. 

The balance of credit card loans reported as TDRs decreased at June 30, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 primarily due to customer usage in programs subject to TDR exclusion in accordance with the CARES Act or interagency guidance . The balance of personal loans reported as TDRs was relatively flat at June 30, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 . The balance of private student reported as TDRs increased at June 30, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 due to continued loan growth and improved awareness of programs available to assist borrowers having difficulties making payment obligations. We plan to continue to use TDR programs as we believe they are useful in assisting customers experiencing financial difficulties and allowing them to make timely payments. See Note 3: Loan Receivables to our condensed 

consolidated financial statements for further description of our use of TDR programs to provide relief to customers experiencing financial hardship.

Net of rewards, including Cashback Bonus rewards, of $385 million and $460 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively, and $863 million and $906 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. 

Total other income decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily due to a decrease in net discount and interchange revenue and loan fee income, which were partially offset by an increase in gain on equity investments. The decrease in discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by a decrease in rewards costs, both of which were the result of lower sales volume due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Loan fee income decreased due to lower sales volume and late fees. Sales volume was lower driven by the COVID-19 impacts. Late fees decreased as a result of lower delinquencies as we continue to work with our customers through the economic stresses from COVID-19. Gain on equity investments increased primarily from a sale during each quarter.

Total other expense was relatively flat for the three months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 . Marketing costs decreased primarily driven by COVID-19 related expense reductions in brand advertising for card. This was offset by a non-cash impairment charge (included in Other expense), on the Diners Club business within the Payment Services segment, driven by changes in the international travel and entertainment businesses that continue to persist and a declining revenue outlook for the foreseeable future resulting from COVID-19, and higher employee compensation and benefits driven by a larger headcount base and higher average salaries. 

Total other expense increased for the six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 . The increase was primarily driven by the COVID-19 related non-cash impairment charge on the Diners Club business discussed above, employee compensation and benefits, and information processing and communications. Employee compensation and benefits increased as a result of a larger headcount base and higher average salaries. The increase in information processing and communications was due to investments in infrastructure. This was offset by a decrease in marketing costs due to COVID-19 related expense reductions in brand advertising for card.

Income tax expense decreased $327 million and $548 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2019 due to pretax losses for the current periods. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 is lower due to a lower projected pretax income for the full year. We calculate our provision for income taxes during interim reporting periods by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year to pretax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequent occurring discrete items. We are projecting a lower pretax income for the full year, therefore the effective tax rate for the full year is lower from the historical annual effective tax rate. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Impact of COVID-19 on Liquidity and Capital 

We entered the COVID-19 pandemic with strong capital and liquidity positions sized to allow us to maintain normal operations during extended periods of financial market stress and disruptions to wholesale and retail funding sources. Our reserves of high-quality liquid assets and access to diverse funding channels allowed us to refrain from issuing debt in disrupted wholesale funding markets and avoid higher funding costs. A s market conditions improved, we fortified our capital position in June by raising $500 million of Tier 1 capital in the form of perpetual preferred stock. Moreover, our direct-to-consumer and sweep deposit balances increased substantially during the second quarter as investors sought safe haven assets. Consequently, our store of liquid assets increased as the quarter progressed. We plan to maintain a prudent liquid asset buffer, particularly so long as heightened uncertainty around the macroeconomic and financial operating environment persists. 

We remain well-capitalized with capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimums and took prudent actions to preserve capital when the macroeconomic and operating environment turned uncertain. Of note, we suspended our plans to purchase shares of our common stock and took actions to reduce our exposures to higher-risk segments of our credit portfolio. We have completed numerous stress tests to assess the impact of a severe economic downturn on our capital and liquidity and maintain ample amounts of both to ensure we remain well-capitalized and funded while continuing to serve our customers and extend special accommodations to those who need it. 

Funding and Liquidity 

We seek to maintain stable, diversified and cost-effective funding sources and a strong liquidity profile in order to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations under both normal operating conditions and periods of economic or financial stress. In managing our liquidity risk, we seek to maintain a prudent liability maturity profile and ready access to an ample store of primary and contingent liquidity sources. Our primary funding sources include direct-to-consumer and brokered deposits, public term asset-backed securitizations and other short-term and long-term borrowings. Our primary liquidity sources include a liquidity portfolio comprised of highly liquid, unencumbered assets, including cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and investment securities, and borrowing capacity through private term asset-backed securitizations. In addition, we have unused borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve discount window, which provides another source of contingent liquidity. 

Funding Sources 

Deposits 

We offer deposit products to customers through two channels: (i) through direct marketing, internet origination and affinity relationships ("direct-to-consumer deposits"); and (ii) indirectly through contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms ("brokered deposits"). Direct-to-consumer deposits include online savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, IRA certificates of deposit and checking accounts, while brokered deposits include certificates of deposit and sweep accounts. At June 30, 2020 , we had $61.1 billion of direct-to-consumer deposits and $16.3 billion of brokered and other deposits. 

Credit Card Securitization Financing 

We securitize credit card receivables as a source of funding. We access the asset-backed securitization market using the Discover Card Master Trust I ("DCMT") and the Discover Card Execution Note Trust ("DCENT"), through which we issue DCENT DiscoverSeries notes in both public and private transactions. From time to time, we may add credit card receivables to these trusts to create sufficient funding capacity for future securitizations while managing seller's interest. We retain significant exposure to the performance of trust assets through holdings of the seller's interest and subordinated security classes of DCENT. At June 30, 2020 , we had $12.5 billion of outstanding public asset-backed securities and $4.2 billion of outstanding subordinated asset-backed securities that had been issued to our wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

The securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors. The primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements, the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities. We refer to this as "economic early amortization", which is based on excess spread levels. Excess spread is the amount by which income received by a trust during a collection period, including interest collections, fees and interchange, exceeds the fees and expenses of the trust during such collection period, including interest expense, servicing fees and charged-off receivables. In the event of an economic early amortization, which would occur if the excess spread fell below 0% on a three-month rolling average basis, we would be required to repay the affected outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received by the trust. For the three months ended June 30, 2020 , the DiscoverSeries three-month rolling average excess spread was 12.27% . The period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received. 

Through our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Discover Funding LLC, we are required to maintain a contractual minimum level of receivables in the trust in excess of the face value of outstanding investors' interests. This excess is referred to as the minimum seller's interest. The required minimum seller's interest in the pool of trust receivables, which is included in credit card loan receivables restricted for securitization investors, is set at approximately 7% in excess of the total investors' interests (which includes interests held by third parties as well as those interests held by us). If the level of receivables in the trust were to fall below the required minimum, we would be required to add receivables from the unrestricted pool of receivables, which would increase the amount of credit card loan receivables restricted for securitization investors. A decline in the amount of the excess seller's interest could occur if balance repayments and charge-offs exceeded new lending on the securitized accounts or as a result of changes in total outstanding investors' interests. Seller's interest is impacted by seasonality as higher balance repayments tend to occur in the first calendar year quarter. If we could not add enough receivables to satisfy the minimum seller's interest requirement, an early amortization (or repayment) of investors' interests would be triggered. 

An early amortization event would impair our liquidity, and may require us to utilize our available non-securitization related contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources, which may or may not be available at the time. We have several strategies we can depl oy to prevent an early amortization event. For instance, we could add additional receivables to the trust, which would reduce our available borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve discount window. As of June 30, 2020 , there were $27.7 billion of credit card receivables in the trust and n o accounts were added to those restricted for securitization investors for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 . Alternatively, we could employ structured discounting, which was used effectively in 2009 to bolster excess spread and mitigate early amortization risk.

The triple-A rating of DCENT Class A Notes issued to date has been based, in part, on an FDIC rule, which created a safe harbor that provides that the FDIC, as conservator or receiver, will not, using its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts, seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization, or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution, provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous GAAP. Although the implementation of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, no longer qualified certain transfers of assets for sale accounting treatment, the FDIC approved a final rule that preserved the safe-harbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts, including DCMT, so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original FDIC safe harbor if evaluated under GAAP pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to December 2009. Other legislative and regulatory developments may, however, impact our ability and/or desire to issue asset-backed securities in the future. 

Other Long-Term Borrowings&#8212;Student Loans 

At June 30, 2020 , $144 million of remaining principal balance was outstanding on securitized debt assumed as part of our acquisition of The Student Loan Corporation. Principal and interest payments on the underlying student loans will reduce the balance of these secured borrowings over time.

Certain Discover Financial Services senior notes require us to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a change of control involving us and a corresponding ratings downgrade to below investment grade. 

Short-Term Borrowings 

As part of our regular funding strategy, we may from time to time borrow short-term funds in the federal funds market or the repurchase ("repo") market through repurchase agreements. Federal funds are short-term, unsecured loans between banks or other financial entities with a Federal Reserve account. Funds borrowed in the repo market are short-term, collateralized loans, usually secured with highly-rated investment securities such as U.S. Treasury bills or notes, or federal agency mortgage bonds or debentures. At June 30, 2020 , there were no outstanding balances in the federal funds market or repurchase agreements. 

Additional Funding Sources 

Private Asset-Backed Securitizations 

We have access to committed borrowing capacity through privately placed asset-backed securitizations. At June 30, 2020 , we had total committed capacity of $6.0 billion , none of which was drawn. While we may utilize funding from these 

private securitizations from time to time for normal business operations, their committed nature also makes them a reliable contingency funding source. Therefore, we reserve some undrawn capacity, informed by our liquidity stress test results, for potential contingency funding needs. We also seek to ensure the stability and reliability of these securitizations by staggering their maturity dates, renewing them approximately one year prior to their scheduled maturity dates and periodically drawing them for operational testing purposes and seasonal funding needs. 

Federal Reserve 

Discover Bank has access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's discount window. As of June 30, 2020 , Discover Bank had $32.8 billion of available borrowing capacity through the discount window based on the amount and type of assets pledged, primarily consumer loans. We have no borrowings outstanding under the discount window and reserve this capacity as a source of contingent liquidity. 

Funding Uses 

Our primary uses of funds include the extensions of loans and credit, primarily through Discover Bank; the purchase of investments for our liquidity portfolio; working capital; and debt and capital service. We assess funding uses and liquidity needs under stressed and normal operating conditions, considering primary uses of funding, such as on-balance sheet loans, and contingent uses of funding, such as the need to post additional collateral for derivatives positions. In order to anticipate funding needs under stress, we conduct liquidity stress tests to assess the impact of idiosyncratic, systemic and hybrid (idiosyncratic and systemic) scenarios with varying levels of liquidity risk reflecting a range of stress severity. 

Credit Ratings 

Our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including those for securitizations and unsecured senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of DFS, Discover Bank and the securitization trusts. Downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations, as well as higher collateral enhancement requirements for both our public and private asset securitizations. In addition to increased funding costs, deterioration in credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. 

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, rating agencies have cited their expectation that the banking industry will experience heightened loan delinquencies and charge-offs as the labor market weakens. During the second quarter, Moody&#8217;s, Standard and Poor&#8217;s, and Fitch Ratings affirmed our credit ratings; Standard and Poor&#8217;s and Fitch changed the outlook on our senior unsecured credit ratings from &#8220;stable&#8221; to &#8220;negative&#8221;, however, while Moody&#8217;s retains a &#8220;stable&#8221; outlook on our ratings. A rating outlook reflects an agency's opinion regarding the likely rating direction over the medium term&#8212;often a period of about a year&#8212;but also indicates the agency's belief that the issuer's credit profile is consistent with its current rating level at that point in time. 

We also maintain agreements with certain of our derivative counterparties that contain provisions that require DFS and Discover Bank to maintain an investment grade credit rating from specified major credit rating agencies. At June 30, 2020 , Discover Bank's credit rating met specified thresholds set by its counterparties. However, if its credit rating was to fall below investment grade, Discover Bank would be required to post additional collateral, which, as of June 30, 2020 , would have been $20 million . DFS (Parent Company) had no outstanding derivatives as of June 30, 2020 , and therefore, no collateral was required.

An "sf" in the rating denotes rating agency identification for structured finance product ratings. 

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 

Liquidity 

We seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under stressed and normal operating conditions. In addition to the funding sources discussed in the previous section, we also maintain highly liquid, unencumbered assets in our liquidity portfolio that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using either the repo market or outright sales. 

We maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy, which outlines the overall framework and general principles we follow in managing liquidity risk across our business. The policy is approved by the Board of Directors with implementation responsibilities delegated to the Asset and Liability Management Committee (the "ALCO"). Additionally, we maintain a liquidity management framework document, which outlines the general strategies, objectives and principles we utilize to manage our liquidity position and the various liquidity risks inherent in our business model. We seek to balance the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which may be costly, with having too little liquidity, which could cause financial distress. Liquidity risk is centrally managed by the ALCO, which is chaired by our Treasurer and has cross-functional membership. The ALCO monitors the liquidity risk profiles of DFS and Discover Bank and oversees any actions Corporate Treasury may take to ensure that we maintain ready access to our funding sources and sufficient liquidity to meet current and projected needs. In addition, the ALCO and our Board of Directors regularly review our compliance with our liquidity limits at DFS and Discover Bank, which are established in accordance with the liquidity risk appetite set by our Board of Directors. 

We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We utilize early warning indicators ("EWIs") to detect emerging liquidity stress events and a reporting and escalation process that is designed to be consistent with regulatory guidance. The EWIs include both idiosyncratic and systemic measures, and are monitored on a daily basis and reported to the ALCO regularly. A warning from one or more of these indicators triggers prompt review and decision-making by our senior management team, and in certain instances may lead to the convening of a senior-level response team and activation of our contingency funding plan. 

In addition, we conduct liquidity stress tests regularly and ensure contingency funding is in place to address potential liquidity shortfalls. We evaluate a range of stress scenarios that are designed in accordance with regulatory requirements, including idiosyncratic, systemic and a combination of such events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs. These scenarios measure the projected liquidity position at DFS and Discover Bank across a range of time horizons by comparing estimated contingency funding needs to available contingent liquidity. 

Our primary contingent liquidity sources include our liquidity portfolio and private securitizations with unused borrowing capacity. In addition, we have unused borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve discount window, which provides an additional source of contingent liquidity. We seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations for at least 12 months in a severe stress environment. In such an environment, we may also take actions to curtail the size of our balance sheet, which would reduce the need for funding and liquidity. 

At June 30, 2020 , our liquidity portfolio is comprised of highly liquid, unencumbered assets, including cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and investment securities. Cash and cash equivalents were primarily in the form of deposits with the Federal Reserve, Treasury bills, and government money market funds. Short term investments primarily included Treasury bills with contractual maturities greater than 90 days but less than one year at the time of acquisition. Investment securities primarily included debt obligations of the U.S. Treasury and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government housing agencies or government-sponsored enterprises. These investments are considered highly liquid, and we expect to have the ability to raise cash by selling them, utilizing repurchase agreements or pledging certain of these investments to access secured funding. The size and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the size of our balance sheet as well as operational requirements, market conditions and interest rate risk management strategies. For instance, our liquidity portfolio grew materially during the second quarter as customer deposits increased and loan balances declined, reflecting consumers&#8217; response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

At June 30, 2020 , our liquidity portfolio and undrawn credit facilities were $65.7 billion , which was $9.4 billion higher than the balance at December 31, 2019 . During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , the average balance of our liquidity portfolio was $25.9 billion and $22.1 billion , respectively. &#160;

Capital 

Our primary sources of capital are the earnings generated by our businesses and the proceeds from issuances of capital securities. We seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the growth and risks of our businesses and to meet regulatory requirements, rating agency targets and debt investor expectations. Within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that provides attractive returns to our stockholders. The level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives, and legislative and regulatory developments. 

Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, DFS, along with Discover Bank, must maintain minimum levels of capital. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a direct material effect on our financial position and results. We must meet specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, as calculated under regulatory guidance and regulations. Current or future legislative or regulatory reforms, such as the implementation of CECL, may require us to hold more capital or adversely impact our capital level. We consider the potential impacts of these reforms in managing our capital position. 

DFS and Discover Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that became effective January 2015 under final rules issued by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to implement the provisions under the Basel Committee's December 2010 framework ("Basel III rules"). The Basel III rules require DFS and Discover Bank to maintain minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios and define what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios. Under Basel III rules for regulatory capital, DFS and Discover Bank are classified as "Standardized Approach" entities, defined as U.S. banking 

organizations with consolidated total assets over $50 billion but not exceeding $250 billion and consolidated total on-balance sheet foreign exposures less than $10 billion. 

As of January 1, 2019, thresholds within the Basel III rules were fully phased in with the exception of certain transition provisions that were frozen pursuant to regulation issued in November 2017. Pursuant to a final rule issued in July 2019, the transition provisions that were previously frozen have been replaced with new permanent thresholds as discussed below. Additionally, on March 27, 2020, federal bank regulatory agencies announced an interim final rule that allows banks that have implemented CECL the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. For purposes of calculating regulatory capital, we have elected to defer recognition of the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for two years in accordance with the interim final rule; after that period of deferral, the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital will be phased in over a three-year period beginning in 2022. We estimate that electing this option raises our Common Equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratios in 2020. For additional information regarding the risk-based capital and leverage ratios, see Note 12: Capital Adequacy to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced the SCB final rule, which would impose limitations on our capital distributions if we do not maintain our capital ratios above stated regulatory minimum ratios based on the results of supervisory stress tests. We participated in the CCAR supervisory stress test this year and received our preliminary SCB of 3.5%, which primarily reflects the difference between our actual CET1 ratio as of the fourth quarter of 2019 and our projected minimum CET1 ratio based on the Federal Reserve&#8217;s models in its nine-quarter Severely Adverse stress scenario. The SCB is expected to become effective October 1, 2020 and we will receive a final SCB by August 31, 2020. Under this rule, we will be required to assess if our planned capital actions are consistent with the effective capital distributions limitations that will apply on a pro-forma basis throughout the planning horizon. See "&#8212; Regulatory Environment and Developments &#8212; Banking &#8212; Capital Standards and Stress Testing" for additional information. 

The Basel III rules provide for certain threshold-based deductions from and adjustments to CET1 to the extent that any one such category or all such categories in the aggregate exceed certain percentages of CET1 . In July 2019, federal banking regulators issued a final rule that, among other things, revised certain capital requirements for Standardized Approach banks by raising the 10% of CET1 deduction threshold for certain items to 25% and eliminating the 15% combined deduction threshold applying to these items. These changes became effective for all Standardized Approach banking institutions in April 2020. 

Basel III rules also require disclosures relating to market discipline. This series of disclosures is commonly referred to as "Pillar 3." The objective is to increase transparency of capital requirements for banking organizations. We are required to make prescribed regulatory disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding our capital structure, capital adequacy, risk exposures and risk-weighted assets. The Pillar 3 disclosures are made publicly available on our website in a report called "Basel III Regulatory Capital Disclosures." 

At June 30, 2020 , DFS and Discover Bank met the requirements for "well-capitalized" status under Regulation Y and the prompt corrective action rules, respectively, exceeding the regulatory minimums to which they were subject under the applicable rules. Additionally, we are subject to regulatory requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve as part of its stress testing framework and CCAR program. Refer to "- Regulatory Environment and Developments" for more information. 

We disclose tangible common equity, which represents common equity less goodwill and intangibles. Management believes that common stockholders' equity excluding goodwill and intangibles is a meaningful measure to investors of our true net asset value. As of June 30, 2020 , tangible common equity is not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, as such, is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Other financial services companies may also disclose this measure and definitions may vary, so we advise users of this information to exercise caution in comparing this measure for different companies. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of total common stockholders' equity (a U.S. GAAP financial measure) to tangible common equity (dollars in millions):

Total common stockholders' equity is calculated as total stockholders' equity less preferred stock. 

For the period between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve pre-approved capital distributions up to a maximum amount for each Category IV bank, including Discover. The Federal Reserve based these capital distribution limits on results from the 2018 supervisory stress test. Notwithstanding the pre-approval, we were still required to prepare in 2019 a capital plan to be approved by our Board of Directors and on April 6, 2020, we submitted to the Federal Reserve a new capital plan for the period July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021, pursuant to the CCAR supervisory stress test. On June 25, 2020, we received the stress test results, which are discussed herein. 

We recently declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $0.44 per share, payable on September 3, 2020 to holders of record on August 20, 2020, which is consistent with last quarter. In light of the current economic downturn, the Federal Reserve required all large banks participating in the CCAR supervisory stress test to cap common stock dividends at the average of a firm&#8217;s net income over the preceding four quarters. We also recently declared a semi-annual cash dividend on our preferred stock (Series C) of $2,750 per share, equal to $27.50 per depositary share, payable on October 30, 2020 to holders of record on October 15, 2020, which is consistent with the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020. On June 22, 2020, we opportunistically issued new perpetual preferred shares (Series D) with a liquidation amount of $500 million ; these shares provide Tier 1 capital and we used the proceeds for general corporate purposes . The Series D preferred stock pays semi-annual dividends at a fixed annual rate of 6.125% until September 23, 2025, after which its dividend rate will reset every five years to a fixed annual rate equal to the 5-year Treasury rate plus 5.783%. 

Our existing share repurchase program, which had $1.2 billion of remaining authorization expires on September 30, 2020 . Having suspended share repurchases earlier this year in recognition of the pandemic-induced economic downturn, we repurchased no common stock during the three months ended June 30, 2020. We may reinstate our share repurchase program in the future, but the Federal Reserve has required all large banks participating in the CCAR supervisory stress test to suspend share repurchases for at least the third quarter. Thereafter, our decision to repurchase additional shares of common stock will depend on our financial results, prevailing and expected economic conditions, potential regulatory limitations, and other considerations. Share repurchases under the program may be made through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other purchases, including block trades, accelerated share repurchase transactions, or any combination of such methods. 

The amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors, such as the implementation of CECL. The declaration and payment of future dividends, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. Holders of our shares of common stock are subject to the prior dividend rights of holders of our preferred stock or the depositary shares representing such preferred stock outstanding, and if full dividends have not been declared and paid on all outstanding shares of preferred stock in any dividend period, no dividend may be declared or paid or set aside for payment on our common stock. In addition, as noted above, banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases, including limitations on the extent to which our banking subsidiaries can provide funds to us through dividends, loans or otherwise. Further, current or future regulatory reforms may require us to hold more capital or adversely impact our capital level. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends or repurchase any shares of our common stock in the future. 

Certain Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Guarantees 

Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying asset, liability, or equity security of a guaranteed party, rate or index. Also included in guarantees are contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another 

entity's failure to perform under an agreement. Our guarantees relate to transactions processed on the Discover Network and certain transactions processed by PULSE and Diners Club. See Note 13: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees. 

Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments 

In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at June 30, 2020 , which include deposits, long-term borrowings, operating lease obligations, interest payments on fixed-rate debt, purchase obligations and other liabilities were $104.7 billion . For a description of our contractual obligations, see our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments." 

We extend credit for consumer loans, primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards and certain other loan products, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. At June 30, 2020 , our unused credit arrangements were approximately $214.0 billion . These arrangements, substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage, customer creditworthiness and loan qualification. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to contractual obligations with external parties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by any such guarantees are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements.
