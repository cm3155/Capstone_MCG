 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report. This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements, which speak to our expected business and financial performance, among other matters, contain words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "aim," "will," "may," "should," "could," "would," "likely," "forecast," and similar expressions. Such statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this quarterly report and there is no undertaking to update or revise them as more information becomes available. 

The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: changes in economic variables, such as the availability of consumer credit, the housing market, energy costs, the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings, the rate of unemployment, the levels of consumer confidence and consumer debt and investor sentiment; the impact of current, pending and future legislation, regulation, supervisory guidance and regulatory and legal actions, including, but not limited to, those related to accounting guidance, tax reform, financial regulatory reform, consumer financial services practices, anti-corruption and funding, capital and liquidity; the actions and initiatives of current and potential competitors; our ability to manage our expenses; our ability to successfully achieve card acceptance across our networks and maintain relationships with network participants and merchants; our ability to sustain and grow our private student loan, personal loan and home loan products; difficulty obtaining regulatory approval for, financing, closing, transitioning, integrating or managing the expenses of acquisitions of or investments in new businesses, products or technologies; our ability to manage our credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk and strategic risk; the availability and cost of funding and capital; access to deposit, securitization, equity, debt and credit markets; the impact of rating agency actions; the level and volatility of equity prices, commodity prices and interest rates, currency values, investments, other market fluctuations and other market indices; losses in our investment portfolio; limits on our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; limits on our ability to receive payments from our subsidiaries; fraudulent activities or material security breaches of our or others' key systems; our ability to remain organizationally effective; our ability to increase or sustain Discover card usage or attract new customers; our ability to maintain relationships with merchants; the effect of political, economic and market conditions, geopolitical events, climate change, pandemics and unforeseen or catastrophic events; our ability to introduce new products and services; our ability to manage our relationships with third-party vendors, as well as those with which we have no direct relationship such as our employees' internet service providers; our ability to maintain current technology and integrate new and acquired systems and technology; our ability to collect amounts for disputed transactions from merchants and merchant acquirers; our ability to attract and retain employees; our ability to protect our reputation and our intellectual property; our ability to comply with regulatory requirements; and new lawsuits, investigations or similar matters or unanticipated developments related to current matters.

Additional factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those described below can be found in this section of this quarterly report and in "Risk Factors," "Business," and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and available at the SEC's internet site (https://www.sec.gov). 

Introduction and Overview 

Discover Financial Services ("DFS") is a digital banking and payment services company. We provide digital banking products and services and payment services through our subsidiaries. We offer our customers credit card loans, private student loans, personal loans, home loans and deposit products. We also operate the Discover Network, the PULSE network ("PULSE") and Diners Club International ("Diners Club"), collectively known as the Discover Global Network. The Discover Network processes transactions for Discover-branded credit and debit cards and provides payment transaction processing and settlement services. PULSE operates an electronic funds transfer network, providing financial institutions issuing debit cards on the PULSE network with access to ATMs domestically and internationally and merchant acceptance throughout the United States of America ("U.S.") for debit card transactions. Diners Club is a global payments network of licensees, which are generally financial institutions, that issue Diners Club branded credit and charge cards and/or provide card acceptance services. 

Our primary revenues consist of interest income earned on loan receivables and fees earned from customers, financial institutions, merchants and issuers. The primary expenses required to operate our business include funding costs (interest expense), credit loss provisions, customer rewards and expenses incurred to grow, manage and service our loan receivables and networks. Our business activities are funded primarily through consumer deposits, securitization of loan receivables and the issuance of unsecured debt. 

Quarter Highlights 

The highlights below compare results as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023, against results for the same period in the prior year. 

&#8226; Net income was $1.0 billion, or $3.58 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.2 billion, or $4.22 per diluted share, in the prior year. 

&#8226; Total loans grew $19.2 billion, or 21%, to $112.7 billion. 

&#8226; Credit card loans grew $16.0 billion, or 22%, to $89.8 billion. 

&#8226; The net charge-off rate for credit card loans increased 126 basis points to 3.10% and the delinquency rate for credit card loans over 30 days past due increased 99 basis points to 2.76%. 

&#8226; Direct-to-consumer deposits grew $11.6 billion, or 18%, to $75.3 billion. 

&#8226; Payment Services transaction volume for the segment was $85.1 billion, up 10%. 

Outlook 

The outlook below provides our current expectations for our financial results based on market conditions, the regulatory and legal environment and our business strategies. 

&#8226; We expect continued loan growth driven by recent account growth, moderation in the payment rate and our current expectation of sales trends. 

&#8226; Based on the current interest rate environment, net interest margin is expected to modestly increase in comparison to 2022. 

&#8226; We expect the total net charge-off rate to increase, in comparison to the prior year, driven by continued credit normalization and seasoning of recent vintages. 

&#8226; Total expenses are expected to increase, driven by investments in acquisition and brand, compliance initiatives, technology and analytics. We remain committed to managing expenses while continuing to make investments in profitable long-term growth. 

Regulatory Environment and Developments 

Banking 

Capital Standards and Stress Testing 

As a bank holding company, DFS is subject to mandatory supervisory stress tests every other year and is required to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve based on forward-looking internal analysis of income and capital levels under baseline and stressful conditions. DFS is also subject to capital buffer requirements, including the Stress Capital Buffer ("SCB"), which requires maintenance of regulatory capital levels above a threshold based on the results of supervisory stress tests after accounting for planned dividend payments. 

In January 2021, the Federal Reserve finalized regulatory amendments that made targeted changes to the capital planning, regulatory reporting and SCB requirements for firms subject to Category IV standards, including DFS, to be consistent with the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulatory tailoring framework. The final rules generally align to instructions the Federal Reserve previously provided to Category IV firms regarding their respective capital plan submissions. The amended rules also provide Category IV firms with the option to submit to supervisory stress tests during off years if they wish for the Federal Reserve to reset the stress test portion of their SCB requirement. The Federal Reserve also revised the scope of application of its existing regulatory guidance for capital planning to align with the tailoring framework. However, the timing 

and substance of any additional changes to existing guidance or new guidance are uncertain. Moreover, following the failure of two domestic banks during March 2023, members of Congress, the President of the United States and various bank regulatory authorities have made public statements indicating a desire for additional prudential regulation for Category IV firms like DFS. While we cannot currently predict the timing or substance of any such regulatory change, if any such change were adopted, it could roll back some or all of the regulatory tailoring currently applicable to DFS or otherwise tighten the prudential regulatory requirements that would apply to DFS. 

In June 2022, the Federal Reserve released results of the 2022 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") exercise. Our capital levels demonstrated resiliency under stress, staying well above regulatory minimums. Based on these results, in August 2022, our new SCB was set at 2.5%, the lowest possible requirement. This new SCB is effective October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023. In accordance with the capital plan rule amendments, we elected not to participate in the 2023 supervisory stress tests. Nevertheless, we submitted to the Federal Reserve on April 5, 2023, a capital plan based on a forward-looking internal assessment of income and capital under baseline and stressful conditions. The Federal Reserve will use our 2023 capital plan submission to assess our capital planning process and positions and to reset the portion of our SCB requirement that is based on four quarters of planned common stock dividends. We expect the Federal Reserve will provide these results in late June or early July 2023. 

London Interbank Offered Rate 

In July 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") announced that it would no longer encourage or compel banks to continue to contribute quotes and maintain the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") after 2021. To support a smooth transition away from LIBOR, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ("ARRC"), a group of private-market participants tasked with facilitating a successful transition from U.S. dollar ("USD") LIBOR to a more robust reference rate. The ARRC identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") as its recommended alternative reference rate for USD LIBOR. The ARRC has also established several priorities and milestones to support the use of SOFR and SOFR-based indices, including developing contractual "fallback" language for capital markets and consumer products; providing clarity on legal, tax, accounting and regulatory matters; promoting broad outreach and education efforts around the LIBOR transition; and recommending spread adjustments for SOFR and SOFR-based indices, which will be of critical importance to market participants once USD LIBOR settings cease in 2023. 

In March 2021, the FCA announced the future cessation and loss of representativeness for all LIBOR benchmark settings. While non-USD and several less frequently referenced USD LIBOR settings ceased publication immediately after December 31, 2021, commonly referenced USD LIBOR settings will cease publication immediately after June 30, 2023; this future cessation event will trigger fallback provisions in many financial contracts that require conversion of the benchmark index from LIBOR to an alternative rate. In July 2021, the ARRC announced its recommendation of forward-looking term rates based on SOFR as additional alternative reference rate options. 

In December 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") finalized a rule to facilitate transition from LIBOR, which became effective on April 1, 2022. Specifically, this final rule provides guidance on LIBOR replacements and the LIBOR transition for purposes of Regulation Z. We have communicated with the CFPB regarding our plans for the LIBOR transition. 

A cross-functional team is overseeing and managing our transition away from the use of LIBOR. This team assesses evolving industry and marketplace norms and conventions for LIBOR-indexed instruments, evaluates the impacts stemming from the future cessation of LIBOR publication and oversees and takes actions to transition our LIBOR exposures to alternative benchmark rates, usually SOFR. Our existing LIBOR exposures are limited to two instruments &#8212; variable-rate student loans and capital markets securities. 

As of March 31, 2023, LIBOR-indexed variable-rate loans comprised approximately 36% of our private student loan portfolio and approximately 4% of our aggregate loan portfolio. These outstanding student loans indexed to LIBOR will convert to a SOFR index in 2023 when 3-month USD LIBOR ceases to be a representative reference rate. As of November 2021, we no longer originate new variable-rate student loans indexed to LIBOR. Instead, new originations of such loans are indexed solely to 3-month term SOFR published by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 

We ceased entering into new LIBOR-indexed interest rate derivatives in 2018 and have since actively eliminated LIBOR exposures in our derivatives portfolio. During the third quarter of 2021, we terminated our last LIBOR-indexed interest rate swap maturing after June 2023; our last LIBOR-indexed interest rate swap matured in January 2022. 

Most of our capital markets securities indexed to USD LIBOR are floating-rate asset-backed securities. Beginning in 2018, we included fallback provisions in all newly issued securities that will facilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR to an appropriate reference rate, which may be based on SOFR, once 1- and 3-month LIBOR cease to be published after June 2023. Approximately $1.5 billion of our capital markets securities that mature after June 2023 with no fallback provisions would be covered under federal legislation enacted in March 2022. This legislation will allow us to replace the LIBOR index with SOFR under a safe harbor provision. Approximately $500 million of our capital markets securities have a rate reset in August 2023 that contain fallback provisions that are not covered under the federal LIBOR legislation; however, we may decide to exercise our right to call and redeem those securities on their reset date or rely on the existing fallback provisions. 

We have prepared for the cessation of USD LIBOR by taking steps to avoid new exposures and actively reduce our remaining exposures. We completed scheduled transition work before year-end 2021, including providing our stakeholders with information about the cessation of USD LIBOR and how it will affect their contracts with us. The transition process will continue through the end of 2023. 

Consumer Financial Services 

The CFPB regulates consumer financial products and services and examines certain providers of consumer financial products and services, including Discover. The CFPB's authority includes rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers with respect to federal consumer protection laws; preventing "unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices" ("UDAAP") and ensuring that consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive financial products and services. Historically, the CFPB's policy priorities focused on several financial products of the type we offer (e.g., credit cards and other consumer lending products). In addition, the CFPB is required by statute to undertake certain actions including its biennial review of the consumer credit card market. 

Under Director Rohit Chopra&#8217;s leadership, the CFPB&#8217;s priorities have focused on and are expected to continue focusing on, among other things, increased enforcement of existing consumer protection laws, with a particular focus on fees charged to consumers, UDAAP, fair lending, student lending and servicing, debt collection and credit reporting. Additionally, detection of repeat offenders, such as companies that violate a formal court or agency order, has become a priority for the CFPB. Director Chopra, in March 2022, identified, as repeat offenders, several companies that have had multiple enforcement actions, including us. The CFPB has recently taken action against financial institutions for violating prior enforcement actions. Enhanced regulatory requirements, potential supervisory findings, or enforcement actions and ratings could negatively impact our ability to implement certain consumer-focused enhancements to product features and functionality and business strategies, limit or change our business practices, limit our consumer product offerings, cause us to invest more management time and resources in compliance efforts or limit our ability to obtain related required regulatory approvals. The additional expense, time and resources needed to comply with ongoing or new regulatory requirements may adversely impact the cost of and access to credit for consumers and results of business operations. 

In December 2020, certain of our subsidiaries entered into a consent order with the CFPB regarding identified private student loan servicing practices. See Note 13: Litigation and Regulatory Matters to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. 

Data Security and Privacy 

Policymakers at the federal and state levels remain focused on enhancing data security and data breach incident response requirements. Furthermore, regulations and legislation at various levels of government have been proposed and enacted to augment consumer data privacy standards, including the capture and use of consumer biometrics. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), which became effective in 2020, created a broad set of privacy rights and remedies modeled in part on the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. The California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"), which became effective on January 1, 2023, amends the CCPA, enhancing consumer privacy protections and creating a new California Privacy Protection Agency ("CPPA"). The CPPA will begin enforcement of the CPRA on July 1, 2023. While the CPRA retains an exemption for information collected, processed, sold, or disclosed subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, we continue to evaluate the impact of the CPRA, as well as other federal and state laws, on our businesses and other providers of consumer financial services. 

Environmental, Social and Governance Matters 

Environmental, social and governance ("ESG") issues, including climate change, human capital and governance practices, are a significant area of focus by lawmakers at the state and federal levels, regulatory agencies, shareholders and other stakeholders. Proposed legislation and rulemakings have been issued or are being considered, including proposals to require disclosure of climate, cybersecurity and other ESG metrics and risk. The potential impact to us of these legislative and regulatory developments is uncertain at this time. 

In particular, in March 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed climate-related disclosure requirements. Through an enterprise-wide working group, we continue to assess the potential impact of the proposed rules, if adopted.

Digital Banking 

Our Digital Banking segment reported pretax income of $1.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $1.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022. 

Net interest income increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily driven by a higher yield on loans and a higher average level of loan receivables, partially offset by higher funding costs. Interest income increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher market rates and a higher average level of loan receivables. Interest expense increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher funding costs driven by higher market rates and a larger funding base. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the provision for credit losses increased as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily driven by loan growth and credit normalization. For a detailed discussion on provision for credit losses, see "&#8212; Loan Quality &#8212; Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses." 

Total other income for the Digital Banking segment increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to increases in loan fee income and net discount and interchange revenue. Loan fee income increased primarily due to a higher volume of late payments. The increase in discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by an increase in rewards, both of which were driven by higher sales volume. 

Total other expense increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits, professional fees and marketing and business development. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was driven primarily by higher headcount. Professional fees increased primarily due to increased consulting supporting consumer compliance initiatives and investments in technology. The increase in marketing and business development was primarily from growth investments in card and consumer banking. 

Discover card sales volume was $50.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023, which was an increase of 9.2% as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. This volume growth was primarily driven by higher consumer spending. 

Payment Services 

Our Payment Services segment reported pretax income of $47 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to pretax loss of $101 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in segment pretax income was primarily due to smaller losses on equity investments, which were the result of smaller mark-to-market adjustments for equity investments measured at fair value. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"), management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain. For estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity, it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period. For estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions, significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain cases, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition. Management has identified the estimates related to our allowance for credit losses as a critical accounting estimate. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses was $7.7 billion at March 31, 2023, which reflects a $385 million build from the amount of the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022. The allowance for credit losses represents management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of our financial assets measured at amortized cost. Changes in the allowance for credit losses, and in the related provision for credit losses, can materially affect net income. 

In estimating the expected credit losses, we use a combination of statistical models and qualitative analysis. There is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced to estimate the allowance for credit losses. For more information on these judgments and our accounting policies and methodologies used to determine the allowance for credit losses, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Loan Quality," Note 4: Loan Receivables and Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

One of the key assumptions requiring significant judgment in estimating the current expected credit losses ("CECL") on a quarterly basis is the determination of the macroeconomic forecasts used in the loss forecast models. For the reasonable and supportable loss forecast period, we consider forecasts of multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base scenario with one or more optimistic (upside) or pessimistic (downside) scenarios. These scenarios comprise a variety of macroeconomic variables, including annualized gross domestic product growth and unemployment rate. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party economists and industry trends. Assumptions about the macroeconomic environment are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual changes in the allowance for credit losses may be different from the simulated scenario presented below. 

To demonstrate the sensitivity of the estimated credit losses to the macroeconomic scenarios, we measured the impact of altering the weighting of macroeconomic scenarios used in our loss forecast. Our allowance for credit losses would increase by approximately $522 million at March 31, 2023 if we applied 100% weight to the most adverse scenario in our sensitivity analysis to reflect continued inflationary pressures, including persistent supply-chain disruptions and the influence of geopolitical events, as well as high interest rates and growing unemployment rates. 

The sensitivity disclosed above is hypothetical. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input, such as the weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because we consider a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. The macroeconomic scenarios used are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses. The inputs in the macroeconomic scenarios may not change at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others. As a result, the sensitivity analysis above does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for credit losses. It is intended to provide insights into the impact of different judgments about the economy on our modeled loss 

estimates for the loan portfolio and does not imply any expectation of future losses. Furthermore, the hypothetical increase in our allowance for credit losses for loans does not incorporate the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the current allowance for credit losses, which may have a positive or negative effect on our actual financial condition and results of operations. 

The overall economic environment directly impacts the macroeconomic variables that are used in the loss forecast models. If management used different assumptions about the economic environment in estimating expected credit losses, the impact to the allowance for credit losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we experience significant instability in the economic environment, the uncertainty around the credit loss forecasts may increase, both due to the uncertainty of the economic forecasts and the challenges our models may have in incorporating them.

Net Interest Income 

The tables that follow this section have been provided to supplement the discussion below and provide further analysis of net interest income, net interest margin and the impact of rate and volume changes on net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets. We analyze net interest income in total by calculating net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total loan receivables) and net yield on interest-earning assets (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets). We also separately consider the impact of the level of loan receivables and the related interest yield and the impact of the cost of funds related to each of our funding sources, along with the income generated by our liquidity portfolio, on net interest income. 

Our interest-earning assets consist of: (i) cash and cash equivalents primarily related to amounts on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, (ii) restricted cash, (iii) other short-term investments, (iv) investment securities and (v) loan receivables. Our interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits, both direct-to-consumer and brokered, and long-term borrowings, including amounts owed to securitization investors. The following factors influence net interest income: 

&#8226; The level and composition of loan receivables, including the proportion of credit card loans to other loans, as well as the proportion of loan receivables bearing interest at promotional rates as compared to standard rates; 

&#8226; The credit performance of our loans, particularly with regard to charge-offs of finance charges, which reduce interest income; 

&#8226; The terms of long-term borrowings and certificates of deposit upon initial offering, including maturity and interest rate; 

&#8226; The interest rates necessary to attract and maintain direct-to-consumer deposits; 

&#8226; The level and composition of other interest-earning assets, including our liquidity portfolio, and interest-bearing liabilities; 

&#8226; Changes in the interest rate environment, including the levels of interest rates and the relationships among interest rate indices, such as the prime rate, the federal funds rate, the interest rate on reserve balances, LIBOR and SOFR; and 

&#8226; The effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program. 

&#160; Net interest income increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily driven by a higher yield on loans and a higher average level of loan receivables, partially offset by higher funding costs. Interest income increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher market rates and a higher average level of loan receivables. Interest expense increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher funding costs driven by higher market rates and a larger funding base.

Loan Quality 

Loan receivables consist of the following (dollars in millions): March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Credit card loans $ 89,755 $ 90,113 Other loans Private student loans 10,480 10,308 Personal loans 8,374 7,998 Other loans 4,065 3,701 Total other loans 22,919 22,007 Total loan receivables 112,674 112,120 Allowance for credit losses (7,691) (7,374) Net loan receivables $ 104,983 $ 104,746 

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimate of credit losses anticipated over the remaining expected life of loan receivables at each period end date. In deriving the estimate of expected credit losses, we consider the collectability of principal, interest and fees associated with our loan receivables. We also consider expected recoveries of amounts that were either previously charged-off or are expected to be charged-off. Establishing the estimate for expected credit losses requires significant management judgment. The factors that influence the provision for credit losses include: 

&#8226; Increases or decreases in outstanding loan balances, including: 

&#8226; Changes in consumer spending, payment and credit utilization behaviors; 

&#8226; The level of new account and loan originations and loan maturities; and 

&#8226; Changes in the overall mix of accounts and products within the portfolio; 

&#8226; The credit quality of the loan portfolio, which reflects our credit granting practices and the effectiveness of collection efforts, among other factors; 

&#8226; The impact of general economic conditions on the consumer, including national and regional conditions, unemployment levels, bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements; 

&#8226; The level and direction of historical losses; and 

&#8226; Regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance. 

Refer to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses" and Note 3: Loan Receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more details on how we estimate the allowance for credit losses. 

The following tables provide changes in our allowance for credit losses (dollars in millions): 

For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 &#160; Credit Card Loans Private Student Loans Personal Loans Other Loans Total Loans Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 5,883 $ 839 $ 595 $ 57 $ 7,374

(1) Represents the adjustment to the allowance for credit losses as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2022-02 on January 1, 2023. 

(2) Excludes a $33 million and $39 million adjustment to the liability for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as the liability is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. 

The allowance for credit losses was approximately $7.7 billion at March 31, 2023, which reflects a $385 million build from the amount of the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022. The build in the allowance for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily driven by a modestly more pessimistic economic outlook and growth in revolving loan balances. 

The allowance estimation process begins with a loss forecast that uses certain macroeconomic variables and multiple macroeconomic scenarios among its inputs. In estimating the allowance at March 31, 2023, we used a macroeconomic forecast that projected the following weighted average amounts: (i) unemployment rate ending 2023 at 4.7% and peaking at 4.8% in early 2024 and (ii) 0.96% growth rate in real gross domestic product in 2023. 

In estimating expected credit losses, we considered the uncertainties associated with borrower behavior and payment trends, as well as recent and expected macroeconomic conditions, such as high consumer price inflation and the fiscal and monetary policy responses to that inflation. The Federal Reserve raised its federal funds rate target range substantially during 2022 in an effort to slow economic growth and reduce inflation. Most economists and financial market participants expect U.S. economic growth and inflation to continue to slow during 2023 as the economy responds to the lagged effects of tighter monetary policy and credit conditions, which may contract further after the failure of two domestic banks in March. 

The forecast period we deemed to be reasonable and supportable was 18 months for all periods presented. The 18-month reasonable and supportable forecast period was deemed appropriate given the current economic conditions. For all periods presented, we determined that a reversion period of 12 months was appropriate for the same reason. We applied a weighted reversion method to provide a more reasonable transition to historical losses for all loan products for all periods presented. 

The provision for credit losses is the amount of expense realized after considering the level of net charge-offs in the period and the required amount of allowance for credit losses at the balance sheet date. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the provision for credit losses increased by $942 million compared to the same period in 2022, primarily driven by loan growth and credit normalization. 

Net Charge-offs 

Our net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude charged-off and recovered interest and fees and fraud losses. Charged-off and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest income and loan fee income, respectively, which is effectively a reclassification of the provision for credit losses, while fraud losses are recorded in other expense. 

The following table presents amounts and rates of net charge-offs of key loan products (dollars in millions): &#160; For the Three Months Ended March 31, &#160; 2023 2022 &#160; $ % $ % Credit card loans $ 684 3.10 % $ 331 1.84 % Private student loans $ 27 1.04 % $ 18 0.69 % Personal loans $ 39 1.94 % $ 19 1.12 % 

The net charge-offs and net charge-off rate for credit card loans increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023, when compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to continued credit normalization and the seasoning of vintages from the past two years. The net charge-offs and net charge-off rate for private student and personal loans increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023, when compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to continued credit normalization. 

Delinquencies 

Delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at a point in time. A loan balance is considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become 30 days past due. 

The following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of key loan products that are 30 and 90 days or more delinquent, and loan receivables that are not accruing interest regardless of delinquency (dollars in millions): &#160; March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 &#160; $ % $ % Loans 30 or more days delinquent Credit card loans $ 2,477 2.76 % $ 2,278 2.53 % Private student loans $ 211 2.02 % $ 212 2.05 % Personal loans $ 76 0.91 % $ 63 0.80 % Total loan receivables $ 2,791 2.48 % $ 2,578 2.30 % Loans 90 or more days delinquent Credit card loans $ 1,204 1.34 % $ 1,028 1.14 % Private student loans $ 54 0.52 % $ 45 0.43 % Personal loans $ 19 0.23 % $ 16 0.21 % Total loan receivables $ 1,290 1.15 % $ 1,101 0.98 % Loans not accruing interest $ 260 0.23 % $ 214 0.19 % 

The 30-day delinquency rates for credit card and personal loans at March 31, 2023, increased compared to December 31, 2022, primarily driven by credit normalization and the seasoning of vintages from the past two years. The 30-day delinquency rate for private student loans remained relatively flat at March 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022. 

The 90-day delinquency rates for credit card and private student loans at March 31, 2023, increased compared to December 31, 2022, primarily driven by credit normalization. The increase in the 90-day delinquency rate for credit card loans was also driven by the seasoning of vintages from the past two years. The 90-day delinquency rates for personal loans remained relatively flat at March 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022. 

Modified and Restructured Loans 

For information regarding modified and restructured loans, see Note 3: Loan Receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Other Income 

The following table presents the components of other income (dollars in millions): &#160; For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 vs. 2022 Increase (Decrease) 2023 2022 $ % 

Discount and interchange revenue, net (1) 

$ 341 $ 320 $ 21 7 % Protection products revenue 43 44 (1) (2) % Loan fee income 166 140 26 19 % Transaction processing revenue 67 57 10 18 % Losses on equity investments (18) (162) 144 (89) % Other income 22 24 (2) (8) % Total other income $ 621 $ 423 $ 198 47 % 

(1) Net of rewards, including Cashback Bonus rewards, of $716 million and $635 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Total other income increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to smaller losses on equity investments and increases in loan fee income and net discount and interchange revenue. The smaller losses on equity investments were the result of smaller mark-to-market adjustments for equity investments measured at fair value. Loan fee income increased primarily due to a higher volume of late payments. The increase in discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by an increase in rewards, both of which were driven by higher sales volume. 

Other Expense 

The following table represents the components of other expense (dollars in millions): &#160; For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 vs. 2022 Increase (Decrease) &#160; 2023 2022 $ % Employee compensation and benefits $ 625 $ 500 $ 125 25 % Marketing and business development 241 192 49 26 % Information processing and communications 139 125 14 11 % Professional fees 232 177 55 31 % Premises and equipment 22 24 (2) (8) % Other expense 124 112 12 11 % Total other expense $ 1,383 $ 1,130 $ 253 22 % 

Total other expense increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits, professional fees and marketing, and business development. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was driven primarily by higher headcount. Professional fees increased primarily due to increased consulting supporting consumer compliance initiatives and investments in technology. The increase in marketing and business development was primarily from growth investments in card and consumer banking. 

Income Tax Expense 

The following table presents the calculation of the effective income tax rate (dollars in millions): &#160; For the Three Months Ended March 31, &#160; 2023 2022 Income before income taxes $ 1,268 $ 1,618 Income tax expense $ 292 $ 376 Effective income tax rate 23.0 % 23.3 % 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Funding and Liquidity 

We seek to maintain stable, diversified and cost-effective funding sources and a strong liquidity profile to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations under normal operating conditions and periods of economic or financial stress. In managing our liquidity risk, we seek to maintain a prudent liability maturity profile and ready access to an ample store of primary and contingent liquidity sources. Our primary funding sources include direct-to-consumer and brokered deposits, public term asset-backed securitizations and other short-term and long-term borrowings. Our primary liquidity sources include a portfolio composed of highly liquid, unencumbered assets, including cash and cash equivalents and investment securities, as well as secured borrowing capacity through private term asset-backed securitizations and Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances. In addition, we have unused borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve discount window, which provides another source of contingent liquidity. 

Funding Sources 

Deposits 

We obtain deposits from consumers directly or through affinity relationships ("direct-to-consumer deposits"). Additionally, we obtain deposits through third-party securities brokerage firms that offer our deposits to their customers ("brokered deposits"). Direct-to-consumer deposit products include savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, IRA savings accounts, IRA certificates of deposit and checking accounts. We gather these deposits from retail customers of our bank, many of whom have more than one Discover product. These deposits originate from a large and diverse customer base, and therefore, the majority of these deposit account balances are insured according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's ("FDIC") insurance limits. Our cost of insuring these deposits is likely to rise as the FDIC recently stated it plans, as required by law, to charge banks a special assessment to cover the cost of losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund incurred after the failure of two domestic banks in March 2023. Brokered deposit products include certificates of deposit and sweep accounts. In accordance with the FDIC final rule on revisions to its brokered deposits regulation, we no longer categorize certain retail deposit products such as affinity deposits and deposits generated through certain sweep deposit relationships as brokered for regulatory reporting purposes. At March 31, 2023, we had $75.3 billion of direct-to-consumer deposits and $20.4 billion of brokered deposits, of which there are $78.3 billion of deposit balances due in less than one year and $17.4 billion of deposit balances due in one year or thereafter. 

Credit Card Securitization Financing 

We securitize credit card receivables as a source of funding. We access the asset-backed securitization market using the Discover Card Master Trust I ("DCMT") and the Discover Card Execution Note Trust ("DCENT"). In connection with our securitization transactions, credit card receivables are transferred to DCMT. DCMT has issued a certificate representing the beneficial interest in its credit card receivables to DCENT. We issue DCENT DiscoverSeries notes in public and private transactions, which are collateralized by the beneficial interest certificate held by DCENT. From time to time, we may add credit card receivables to DCMT to create sufficient funding capacity for future securitizations while managing seller's interest. We retain significant exposure to the performance of the securitized credit card receivables through holding the seller's interest and subordinated classes of DCENT DiscoverSeries notes. At March 31, 2023, we had $9.0 billion of outstanding public asset-backed securities and $3.2 billion of outstanding subordinated asset-backed securities that had been issued to our wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

The securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors. The primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements, the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities. We refer to this as "economic early amortization," which is based on excess spread levels. Excess spread is the amount by which income received with respect to the securitized credit card receivables during a collection period including interest collections, fees and interchange, exceeds the fees and expenses of DCENT during such collection period, including interest expense, servicing fees and charged-off receivables. In the event of an economic early amortization, which would occur if the excess spread fell below 0% on a three-month rolling average basis, we would be required to repay all outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received with respect to the securitized credit card receivables. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the DiscoverSeries three-month rolling average excess spread was 14.45%. The period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received. 

Through our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Discover Funding LLC, we are required to maintain an interest in a contractual minimum level of receivables in DCMT in excess of the face value of outstanding investors' interests. This minimum interest is referred to as the minimum seller's interest. The required minimum seller's interest in the pool of trust receivables is approximately 7% in excess of the total investors' interests, which includes interests held by third parties as well as those interests held by us. If the level of receivables in DCMT were to fall below the required minimum, we would be required to add receivables from the unrestricted pool of receivables, which would increase the amount of credit card receivables restricted for securitization investors. A decline in the amount of the excess seller's interest could occur if balance repayments and charge-offs exceeded new lending on the securitized accounts or as a result of changes in total outstanding investors' interests. Seller's interest exhibits seasonality as higher receivable balance repayments tend to occur in the first calendar year quarter. If we could not add enough receivables to satisfy the minimum seller's interest requirement, an early amortization (or repayment) of investors' interests would be triggered. 

An early amortization event would impair our liquidity and may require us to utilize our available non-securitization-related contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources, which may or may not be available at the time. We have several strategies we can deploy to prevent an early amortization event. For instance, we could add receivables to DCMT, which would reduce our available borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve discount window. As of March 31, 2023, there were $24.5 billion of credit card receivables in the trust and no accounts were added to those restricted for securitization investors for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Alternatively, we could employ structured discounting, which was used effectively in 2009 to bolster excess spread and mitigate early amortization risk. 

The following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors' interests in credit card securitizations, excluding those that have been issued to our wholly-owned subsidiaries (dollars in millions): At March 31, 2023 Total Less Than One Year One Year and Thereafter Scheduled maturities of borrowings - owed to credit card securitization investors $ 9,016 $ 300 $ 8,716 

The "AAA(sf)" and "Aaa(sf)" ratings of the DCENT DiscoverSeries Class A Notes issued to date have been based, in part, on an FDIC rule, which created a safe harbor that provides that the FDIC, as conservator or receiver, will not use its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts, seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization, or recharacterize assets transferred in connection with a securitization as assets of the insured depository institution, provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous GAAP. Although the implementation of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing , no longer qualified certain transfers of assets for sale accounting treatment, the FDIC approved a final rule that preserved the safe-harbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts, including DCMT, so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original FDIC safe harbor if evaluated under GAAP pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to December 2009. However, other legislative and regulatory developments may impact our ability or desire to issue asset-backed securities in the future. 

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances 

Discover Bank is a member bank of the FHLB of Chicago, one of 11 FHLBs that, along with the Office of Finance, compose the FHLB System. The FHLBs are government-sponsored enterprises of the U.S. ("U.S. GSEs") chartered to improve the availability of funds to support home ownership. As such, senior debt obligations of the FHLBs feature the same credit ratings as U.S. Treasury securities and are considered high-quality liquid assets for bank regulatory purposes. 

Consequently, the FHLBs benefit from consistent capital market access during nearly all macroeconomic and financial market conditions and low funding costs, which they pass on to their member banks when they borrow advances. Thus, we consider FHLB advances a stable and reliable funding source for Discover Bank for short-term contingent liquidity and long-term asset-liability management. 

As a member of the FHLB of Chicago, Discover Bank has access to short- and long-term advance structures with maturities ranging from overnight to 30 years. At March 31, 2023, we had total committed borrowing capacity of $2.6 billion based on the amount and type of assets pledged, of which $525 million of long-term advances were outstanding with the FHLB of Chicago. Under certain stressed conditions, we could pledge our liquidity portfolio securities and borrow against them at a modest reduction to their value. 

Other Long-Term Borrowings&#8212;Corporate and Bank Debt 

The following table provides a summary of Discover Financial Services (Parent Company) and Discover Bank outstanding fixed-rate debt (dollars in millions): At March 31, 2023 Principal Amount Outstanding Discover Financial Services (Parent Company) fixed-rate senior notes, maturing 2024-2032 $ 3,350 Discover Financial Services (Parent Company) fixed-rate retail notes, maturing 2023-2031 $ 155 Discover Bank fixed-rate senior bank notes, maturing 2023-2030 $ 4,550 Discover Bank fixed-rate subordinated bank notes, maturing 2028 $ 500 

At March 31, 2023, $548 million of interest on our fixed-rate debt is due in less than one year and $1.5 billion of interest is due in one year and thereafter. See Note 6: Long-Term Borrowings to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on the maturities of our long-term borrowings. Certain DFS senior notes require us to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a change of control involving us and corresponding ratings downgrade below investment grade. 

Short-Term Borrowings 

As part of our regular funding strategy, we may, from time to time, borrow short-term funds in the federal funds market or the repurchase ("repo") market through repurchase agreements. Federal funds are short-term, unsecured loans between banks or other financial entities with a Federal Reserve account. Funds borrowed in the repo market are short-term, collateralized loans, usually secured with highly rated investment securities such as U.S. Treasury bills or notes, or mortgage bonds or debentures issued by government agencies or U.S. GSEs. At March 31, 2023, there were no outstanding balances in the federal funds market or under repurchase agreements. 

Additional Funding Sources 

Private Asset-Backed Securitizations 

We have access to committed borrowing capacity through privately placed asset-backed securitizations. While we may utilize funding from these private securitizations from time to time for normal business operations, their committed nature also makes them a reliable contingency funding source. Therefore, we reserve some undrawn capacity, informed by our liquidity stress test results, for potential contingency funding needs. At March 31, 2023, we had a total committed capacity of $3.5 billion, none of which was drawn. We seek to ensure the stability and reliability of these securitizations by staggering their maturity dates, renewing them well ahead of their scheduled maturity dates and periodically drawing them for operational tests and seasonal funding needs. 

Federal Reserve 

Discover Bank has access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's discount window. As of March 31, 2023, Discover Bank had $43.8 billion of available borrowing capacity through the discount window based on the amount and type of assets pledged, primarily consumer loans. As of March 31, 2023, we have no borrowings outstanding under the discount window and reserve this capacity as a source of contingent liquidity. 

Funding Uses 

Our primary uses of funds include the extensions of loans and credit to customers, primarily through Discover Bank; the maintenance of sufficient working capital for routine operations; the service of our debt and capital obligations, including interest, principal and dividend payments; and the purchase of investment securities for our liquidity portfolio. 

In addition to originating consumer loans to new customers, we also extend credit to existing customers, which primarily arises from agreements for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards and certain other loan products, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. At March 31, 2023, our unused credit arrangements were approximately $229.1 billion. These arrangements, substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage, customer creditworthiness and loan qualification. 

In the normal course of business, we enter into various contracts for goods and services, such as consulting, outsourcing, data, sponsorships, software licenses, telecommunications and global merchant acceptance, among other things. These contracts are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including any applicable fixed future cash payments. 

As of March 31, 2023, we have debt obligations, common stock and preferred stock outstanding. Refer to &#8220;&#8212; Funding Sources&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212; Capital&#8221; for more information related to our debt obligations and capital service, respectively, and the timing of expected payments. 

We assess funding uses and liquidity needs under stressed and normal operating conditions, considering primary uses of funding, such as on-balance sheet loans and contingent uses of funding, such as the need to post additional collateral for derivatives positions. To anticipate funding needs under stress, we conduct liquidity stress tests to assess the impact of idiosyncratic, systemic and hybrid (i.e., idiosyncratic and systemic) scenarios with varying levels of liquidity risk reflecting a range of stress severity. If we determine we have excess cash and cash equivalents above what is required for daily operations, we may invest in highly liquid, unencumbered assets that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using the repo market or outright sales. 

Guarantees 

Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that may require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying asset, liability, or equity security of a guaranteed party, rate or index. Also included in guarantees are contracts that may require the guarantor to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entity&#8217;s failure to perform under an agreement. Our guarantees relate to transactions processed on the Discover Network and certain transactions processed by PULSE and Diners Club. In the ordinary course of business, we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to contractual obligations with external parties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by any such guarantees are included in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 12: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees. 

Credit Ratings 

Our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including those for securitizations and unsecured senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of DFS, Discover Bank and the securitization trusts. Downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations, as well as higher credit enhancement requirements for both our public and private asset securitizations. In addition to increased funding costs, deterioration in our credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. 

On March 7, 2023, Moody's Investors Service upgraded the long-term credit ratings and assessments of DFS and Discover Bank. Moody's noted the ratings upgrade reflected our solid market position in the U.S. general purpose credit card and other consumer lending markets, as well as our strong profitability, prudent credit underwriting, conservative risk management and anticipated resilience to a severe economic downturn because of good asset quality and balance sheet management. The table below reflects our current credit ratings and outlooks: Moody&#8217;s Investors Service Standard &#38; Poor's Fitch Ratings Discover Financial Services Senior unsecured debt Baa2 BBB- BBB+ Outlook for Discover Financial Services senior unsecured debt Stable Stable Stable Discover Bank Senior unsecured debt Baa1 BBB BBB+ Outlook for Discover Bank senior unsecured debt Stable Stable Stable Subordinated debt Baa1 BBB- BBB Discover Card Execution Note Trust (DCENT)

(1) An "sf" in the rating denotes rating agency identification for structured finance product ratings. 

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. A credit rating outlook reflects an agency's opinion regarding the likely rating direction over the medium term, often a period of about a year, and indicates the agency's belief that the issuer's credit profile is consistent with its current rating level at that point in time. 

Liquidity 

We seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under stressed and normal operating conditions. In addition to the funding sources discussed in the previous section, we also maintain highly liquid, unencumbered assets in our liquidity portfolio that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using either the repo market or outright sales. 

We maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy, which outlines the overall framework and general principles we follow in managing liquidity risk across our business. The Board of Directors approves the policy and the Asset and Liability Management Committee (the "ALCO") is responsible for its implementation. Additionally, we maintain a liquidity management framework document that outlines the general strategies, objectives and principles we utilize to manage our liquidity position and the various liquidity risks inherent in our business model. We seek to balance the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which may be costly, with having too little liquidity, which could cause financial distress. The ALCO, chaired by our Treasurer, has cross-functional membership and manages liquidity risk centrally. The ALCO monitors the liquidity risk profiles of DFS and Discover Bank and oversees any actions Corporate Treasury may take to ensure that we maintain ready access to our funding sources and sufficient liquidity to meet current and projected needs. In addition, the ALCO and our Board of Directors regularly review our compliance with our liquidity limits at DFS and Discover Bank, which are established in accordance with the liquidity risk appetite set by our Board of Directors. 

We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We utilize early warning indicators ("EWIs") to detect emerging liquidity stress events and a reporting and escalation process designed to be consistent with regulatory guidance. The EWIs include both idiosyncratic and systemic measures and are monitored daily and reported to the ALCO regularly. A warning from one or more of these indicators triggers prompt review and decision-making by our senior management team and, in certain instances, may lead to the convening of a senior-level response team and activation of our contingency funding plan. 

In addition, we conduct liquidity stress tests regularly and ensure contingency funding is in place to address potential liquidity shortfalls. We evaluate a range of stress scenarios that are designed to follow regulatory requirements, including idiosyncratic, systemic and a combination of such events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs. These scenarios measure the projected liquidity position at DFS and Discover Bank across a range of time horizons by comparing estimated contingency funding needs to available contingent liquidity. 

Our primary contingency liquidity sources include our liquidity portfolio securities, which we could sell, repo or borrow against, and private securitizations with unused borrowing capacity. In addition, we could borrow FHLB advances by pledging securities to the FHLB of Chicago. Moreover, we have unused borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve discount window, which provides an additional source of contingency liquidity. We seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations for at least 12 months in a severe stress environment. In such an environment, we may also take actions to curtail the size of our balance sheet, which would reduce the need for funding and liquidity. 

At March 31, 2023, our liquidity portfolio was composed of highly liquid, unencumbered assets, including cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Cash and cash equivalents were primarily deposits with the Federal Reserve. Investment securities primarily included debt obligations of the U.S. Treasury and U.S. GSEs and residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. GSEs. These investments, nearly all of which are classified as available-for-sale, are considered highly liquid and we expect to have the ability to raise cash by selling them, utilizing repurchase agreements or pledging certain of these investments to access secured funding. The size and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based on the size of our balance sheet as well as operational requirements, market conditions and interest rate risk management objectives. 

At March 31, 2023, our liquidity portfolio and undrawn credit facilities were $70.8 billion, which was $3.5 billion higher than the balance at December 31, 2022. Our liquidity portfolio and undrawn credit facilities grew primarily as a result of the purchase of treasury securities and additional borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the average balance of our liquidity portfolio was $19.5 billion and $16.3 billion, respectively. Our liquidity portfolio and undrawn facilities consist of the following (dollars in millions):

Bank Holding Company Liquidity 

The primary uses of funds at the unconsolidated DFS level include debt service obligations (interest payments and return of principal) and capital service and management activities, including dividend payments on capital instruments and the periodic repurchase of shares of our common stock. Our primary sources of funds at the bank holding company level include the proceeds from the issuance of unsecured debt and capital securities, as well as dividends from our subsidiaries, notably Discover Bank. Under periods of idiosyncratic or systemic stress, the bank holding company could lose or experience impaired access to the capital markets. In addition, our regulators have the discretion to restrict dividend payments from Discover Bank to the bank holding company. 

We utilize a measure referred to as Number of Months of Pre-Funding to determine the length of time DFS can meet upcoming funding obligations, including common and preferred stock dividend payments and debt service obligations using existing cash resources. In managing this metric, we structure our debt maturity schedule to manage prudently the amount of debt maturing within a short period. See Note 6: Long-Term Borrowings to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt. 

Capital 

Our primary sources of capital are the earnings generated by our businesses and the proceeds from issuances of capital securities. We seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support our businesses' growth, account for their risks, and meet regulatory requirements, rating agency targets and debt investor expectations. Within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that provides attractive returns to our stockholders. The level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments. 

Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, DFS, along with Discover Bank, must maintain minimum capital levels. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a direct material effect on our financial condition and operating results. We must meet specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, as calculated under regulatory guidance and regulations. Current or future legislative or regulatory reforms, such as those related to the adoption of the CECL accounting model, may require us to hold more capital or adversely impact our capital level. We consider the potential impacts of these reforms in managing our capital position. 

DFS and Discover Bank are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, respectively, under the Basel Committee's December 2010 framework ("Basel III rules"). Under the Basel III rules, DFS and Discover Bank are classified as "standardized approach" entities as they are U.S. banking organizations with consolidated total assets over $50 billion but not exceeding $250 billion and consolidated total on-balance sheet foreign exposures less than $10 billion. The Basel III rules require DFS and Discover Bank to maintain minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios and define what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios. 

In accordance with the final rule on the impact of CECL on regulatory capital, we have elected to phase in the impact over three years, beginning in 2022. By electing this option, our Common Equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratios are higher than they otherwise would have been. The phase-in of the CECL accounting model decreased CET1 by $1.1 billion as of January 1, 2023. For additional information regarding the risk-based capital and leverage ratios, see Note 11: Capital Adequacy to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced the SCB final rule, which imposes limitations on DFS' capital distributions if we do not maintain our risk-based capital ratios above stated regulatory minimum ratios based on the results of supervisory stress tests. Under this rule, DFS is required to assess whether our planned capital actions are consistent with the effective capital distribution limitations that will apply on a pro-forma basis throughout the planning horizon. 

The SCB requirement is institution-specific and is calculated as the greater of (i) 2.5% and (ii) the sum of (a) the difference between DFS' actual CET1 ratio at the beginning of the forecast and the projected minimum CET1 ratio based on the Federal Reserve's models in its nine-quarter Severely Adverse stress scenario, plus (b) the sum of the dollar amount of DFS' planned common stock dividend distributions for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of its nine-quarter capital planning horizon, expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. For Category IV firms, including DFS, the Federal Reserve calculates each firm's SCB biennially in even-numbered calendar years, and did so in 2022. Based on the results of the 2022 CCAR exercise released by the Federal Reserve, our new SCB was set at 2.5%, the lowest possible requirement, effective October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023. In odd-numbered years, each firm subject to Category IV standards that did not opt-in to such year's supervisory stress tests as part of the Federal Reserve's CCAR process receives an adjusted SCB requirement that is updated to reflect its planned common stock dividends per the firm's annual capital plan. We elected not to opt-in for 2023 and submitted a capital plan to the Federal Reserve on April 5, 2023, and we expect results will be provided in late June or early July 2023. See "&#8212; Regulatory Environment and Developments &#8212; Banking &#8212; Capital Standards and Stress Testing" for additional information. 

At March 31, 2023, DFS and Discover Bank met the requirements for "well-capitalized" status under the Federal Reserve's Regulation Y and the prompt corrective action rules and corresponding FDIC requirements, respectively, exceeding the regulatory minimums to which they were subject under the applicable rules. 

Basel III rules also require disclosures relating to market discipline. This series of disclosures is commonly referred to as "Pillar 3." The objective is to increase the transparency of capital requirements for banking organizations. We are required to make prescribed regulatory disclosures quarterly regarding our capital structure, capital adequacy, risk exposures and risk- 

weighted assets. We make the Pillar 3 disclosures publicly available on our website in a report called "Basel III Regulatory Capital Disclosures." 

We disclose tangible common equity, which represents common equity less goodwill and intangibles. Management believes that common stockholders' equity excluding goodwill and intangibles is meaningful to investors as a measure of our true net asset value. At March 31, 2023, tangible common equity is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure as it is not formally defined by GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations. Other financial services companies may also disclose this measure and definitions may vary. We advise users of this information to exercise caution in comparing this measure for different companies. 

The following table reconciles total common stockholders' equity (a GAAP financial measure) to tangible common equity (dollars in millions): March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022

Our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program in April 2023. The new program authorizes up to $2.7 billion of share repurchases through June 30, 2024, and replaced the prior $4.2 billion share repurchase program. If and when we repurchase our shares under the program, we may use various methods, including open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other purchases, including block trades, accelerated share repurchase transactions, or any combination of such methods. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we repurchased approximately 11.3 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion. 

The amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory review and other factors. The declaration and payment of future dividends and the amount thereof are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. Holders of our shares of common stock are subject to the prior dividend rights of holders of our preferred stock or the depositary shares representing such preferred stock outstanding. No dividend may be declared or paid or set aside for payment on our common stock if full dividends have not been declared and paid on all outstanding shares of preferred stock in any dividend period. In addition, as noted above, banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases, including limitations on the extent our banking subsidiary (Discover Bank) can provide funds to us through dividends, loans or otherwise. Further, current or future regulatory reforms may require us to hold more capital or could adversely impact our capital level. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends or repurchase any shares of our common stock in the future.
