 Item 1A. Risk Factors 

There have been no material changes in the risk factors previously disclosed in the section titled "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of Valley&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, except as described below, and previously disclosed in Valley&#8217;s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023: 

Our financial results and condition may be adversely impacted by recent events in the banking industry or any future similar events. 

Recent events impacting the banking industry, including the bank failures in March and April 2023, have resulted in significant disruption and volatility in the capital markets, reduced current valuations of bank securities, and decreased confidence in banks among depositors and other counterparties as well as investors. These events occurred in the context of rapidly rising interest rates which, among other things, have resulted in unrealized losses in longer duration debt securities and loans held by banks, increased competition for deposits and potentially increased the risk of recession. These events have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. 

While the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC took steps to ensure that depositors of recently failed banks would have access to their insured and uninsured deposits, and to facilitate sales of certain failed banks, there is no assurance that these or similar actions will restore customer confidence in the banking system, and we may be further impacted by concerns regarding the soundness of other financial institutions, or other future bank failures or disruptions. Any loss of client deposits or changes in our credit ratings could increase the cost of funding, limit access to capital markets or negatively impact our overall liquidity or capitalization. The cost of resolving the recent bank failures may also prompt the FDIC to increase its premiums above current levels or to issue additional special assessments. 

These recent events and any future similar events may also result in changes to laws or regulations governing bank holding companies and banks, including higher capital requirements, or the imposition of restrictions through supervisory or enforcement activities, which could materially impact our business.
