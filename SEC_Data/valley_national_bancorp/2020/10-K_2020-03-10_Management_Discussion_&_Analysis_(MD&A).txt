Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our accounting and reporting policies conform, in all material respects, to U.S. GAAP. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management has made estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 

Valley&#8217;s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations. Our significant accounting policies are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We identified our policies for the allowance for loan losses, purchased credit-impaired loans, goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes to be critical because management has to make subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Management has reviewed the application of these policies with the Audit Committee of Valley&#8217;s Board of Directors. 

The judgments used by management in applying the critical accounting policies discussed below may be affected by significant changes in the economic environment, which may result in changes to future financial results. Specifically, subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in material changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods, and the inability to collect on outstanding loans could result in increased loan losses. In addition, the valuation of certain collateral dependent impaired loans (including New York City taxi medallion loan valuations based on the estimated value of the underlying medallions) could be adversely impacted by illiquidity or dislocation in certain markets, resulting in depressed market valuations of the underlying collateral, thus leading to additional provisions for loan losses. 

Allowance for Loan Losses . The allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded commercial letters of credit and represents management&#8217;s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolios. There are numerous components that enter into the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses, which includes a quantitative analysis, as well as a qualitative review of its results. The qualitative review is subjective and requires a significant amount of judgment. Various banking regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, also review the allowance for loan losses. Such regulators may require, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, that certain loan balances be charged off or require that adjustments be made to the allowance for loan losses when their credit evaluations differ from those of management. Additionally, our allowance for credit losses methodology includes loan portfolio evaluations at the portfolio segment level, which consists of the commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, construction, residential mortgage, home equity, automobile and other consumer loan portfolios. 

The allowance for loan losses consists of the following: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

specific reserves for individually impaired loans; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

reserves for adversely classified loans, and higher risk rated loans that are not impaired loans; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

reserves for other loans that are not impaired; and, if applicable, 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

reserves for impairment of purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans subsequent to their acquisition date. 

##TABLE_END Our reserves on classified and non-classified loans also include reserves based on general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to Valley, including changes in loan portfolio volume, the composition and concentrations of credit, new market initiatives, and the impact of competition on loan structuring and pricing. 

Reserves for PCI loans within the Allowance for Loan Losses 

We evaluated the acquired PCI loans and elected to account for them in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Subtopic 310-30, &#8220;Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality,&#8221; since all of these loans were acquired at a discount attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. The PCI loans are initially recorded at their estimated fair values segregated into pools of loans sharing common risk characteristics. The fair values include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows. 

The PCI loans are subject to our internal credit review. If and when unexpected credit deterioration occurs at the loan pool level subsequent to the acquisition date, a provision for credit losses for the PCI loans will be charged to earnings for the full amount of the decline in expected cash flows for the pool. Under the accounting guidance of ASC Subtopic 310-30, for acquired credit impaired loans, the allowance for loan losses on (or reserves for) PCI loans is measured at each financial reporting date based on future expected cash flows. This assessment and measurement are performed at the pool level and not at the individual loan level. Accordingly, decreases in expected cash flows resulting from further credit deterioration on a pool of acquired PCI 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

2019 Form 10-K 

##TABLE_END

loan pools as of such measurement date compared to those originally estimated are recognized by recording a provision and allowance for loan losses on PCI loans. Subsequent increases in the expected cash flows of the loans in that pool would first reduce any allowance for loan losses on PCI loans; and any excess will be accreted for prospectively as a yield adjustment. Valley had no allowance reserves related to PCI loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . 

Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in this MD&#38;A. 

Effective January 1, 2020, Valley adopted new accounting guidance which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology (discussed above and elsewhere in this MD&#38;A) with a current expected credit loss (CECL) model. Under the new guidance, Valley will be required to measure expected credit losses by utilizing forward-looking information to assess its allowance for credit losses. The guidance also requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. See Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for further details. 

Changes in Our Allowance for Loan Losses 

Valley considers it difficult to quantify the impact of changes in forecast on its allowance for loan losses. However, management believes the following discussion may enable investors to better understand the variables that drive the allowance for loan losses, which amounted to $161.8 million at December 31, 2019 . 

For impaired credits, if the present value of expected cash flows were 10 percent higher or lower, the allowance would have decreased $2.2 million or increased $4.1 million , respectively, at December 31, 2019 . If the fair value of the collateral (for collateral dependent loans) was 10 percent higher or lower, the allowance would have decreased $3.8 million or increased $4.5 million , respectively, at December 31, 2019 . 

The internal risk rating assigned to each non-classified credit is an important variable in determining the allowance. If each non-classified credit were rated one grade worse (special mention rate), the allowance would have increased by approximately $47.5 million as of December 31, 2019 . Additionally, if the loss factors used to calculate the allowance for non-classified loans were 10 percent higher or lower, the allowance would have increased or decreased by approximately $11.6 million , respectively, at December 31, 2019 . Moreover, if the expected loss rate applied to classified loans were to increase or decrease by 10 percent, the allowance would have been $740 thousand higher or lower, respectively, at December 31, 2019 . 

Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans. Purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans are loans acquired at a discount (that is due, in part, to credit quality). Valley's PCI loan portfolio totaling $6.6 billion at December 31, 2019 primarily consists of loans acquired in business combinations subsequent to 2011. The PCI loans are initially recorded at fair value (as determined by the present value of expected future cash flows) with no valuation allowance (i.e., the allowance for loan losses), and aggregated and accounted for as pools of loans based on common risk characteristics. We estimate the undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected by incorporating several key assumptions, including probability of default, loss given default, and the amount of actual prepayments after the acquisition dates. The difference between the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition and the initial carrying amount (fair value) of the PCI loans, or the &#8220;accretable yield,&#8221; is recognized as interest income utilizing the level-yield method over the life of each pool. Contractually required payments for interest and principal that exceed the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition, or the &#8220;non-accretable difference.&#8221; The non-accretable difference, which is neither accreted into income nor recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, reflects estimated future credit losses and uncollectable contractual interest expected to be incurred over the life of the loans. Prepayments affect the estimated life of PCI loans and could change the amount of interest income, and possibly principal, expected to be collected. Reclassifications of the non-accretable difference to the accretable yield may occur subsequent to the loan acquisition dates due to increases in our estimate of the expected cash flows of the loan pools. 

On a quarterly, or more frequent basis, the Bank evaluates the remaining contractual required payments due and estimates of cash flows expected to be collected for the underlying loans of each PCI loan pool. These evaluations require the continued use of key assumptions and estimates necessary in forecasting the estimated cash flows. We attempt to ensure the forecasted expectations are reasonable based on the information currently available; however, due to the uncertainties inherent in the use of estimates, actual cash flow results may differ from our forecast and the differences may be significant. To mitigate such differences, we carefully prepare and review the assumptions utilized in forecasting estimated cash flows. 

PCI loans that may have been classified as non-performing loans by an acquired bank are no longer classified as non-performing because these loans are accounted for on a pooled basis. Management&#8217;s judgment is required in classifying loans in pools as performing loans, and is dependent on having a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of the pool cash flows to be collected, even if certain loans within the pool are contractually past due.

##TABLE_END

See Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, and the "Loan Portfolio" section included in this MD&#38;A for further PCI loan details, including net increases and decreases in expected cash flows subsequent to the applicable PCI loan acquisition dates impacting the accretable yield in 2019 and 2018 . 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We record all assets, liabilities, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets, at fair value as of the acquisition date, and expense all acquisition related costs as incurred as required by ASC Topic 805, &#8220;Business Combinations.&#8221; Goodwill totaling $1.4 billion at December 31, 2019 is not amortized but is subject to annual tests for impairment or more often, if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired. Other intangible assets totaling $86.8 million at December 31, 2019 are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment tests if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount. Such evaluation of other intangible assets is based on undiscounted cash flow projections. The initial recording of goodwill and other intangible assets requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. 

Prior to new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2020, the goodwill impairment analysis was generally a two-step test. During 2019 , Valley elected to perform step one of the two-step goodwill impairment test for all of its reporting units but may choose to perform an optional qualitative assessment allowable for one or more units in future periods to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Step one compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an additional step must be performed. That additional step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination, i.e., by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step above, over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities, and identifiable intangibles, as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination at the impairment test date. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill and subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted. 

Based upon Valley&#8217;s 2019 goodwill impairment testing, the fair values of its four reporting units, wealth management, consumer lending, commercial lending, and investment management, were in excess of their carrying values. However, due to lower yields on our investment portfolio and reinvestment of normal repayments from investment securities into new loan originations, our investment management segment experienced downward pressure on its fair value. While not expected at this time, we may be required to record a charge to earnings should there be a deficiency in our estimated fair value of the investment management and other reporting units during our subsequent annual (or more frequent) impairment tests. See the "Business Segments" section below for more information regarding our business segments/reporting units. 

Fair value may be determined using market prices, comparison to similar assets, market multiples, certain discounted cash flow analyses and other determinants. Estimated cash flows may extend far into the future and, by their nature, are difficult to determine over an extended timeframe. Factors that may materially affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces, customer behaviors and attrition, changes in revenue growth trends, cost structures and technology, and changes in discount rates, terminal values, and specific industry or market sector conditions. To assist in assessing the impact of potential goodwill or other intangible assets impairment charges at December 31, 2019 , the impact of a five percent impairment charge on these intangible assets would result in a reduction in pre-tax income of approximately $73.0 million . Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets. 

Income Taxes. We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities. The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws to our business activities, as well as the timing of when certain items may affect taxable income. 

Our interpretations may be subject to review during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise over the respective tax positions. We attempt to resolve these disputes during the tax examination and audit process and ultimately through the court systems when applicable. We monitor relevant tax authorities and revise our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities on a quarterly basis. Revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes also may result from our own income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies. Such revisions in our estimates may be material to our operating results for any given quarter. 

The provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

2019 Form 10-K 

##TABLE_END

management&#8217;s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. We perform regular reviews to ascertain the realizability of our deferred tax assets. These reviews include management&#8217;s estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income, which also incorporate various tax planning strategies. In connection with these reviews, if we determine that a portion of the deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is established. Management determined it is more likely than not that Valley will realize its net deferred tax assets, except for immaterial valuation allowances, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . 

During 2018, we recognized a $2.3 million tax benefit related to the adjustment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) provisional amounts in our final 2017 tax returns completed in the fourth quarter 2018. In the fourth quarter 2017, we re-measured and reduced our deferred tax assets by $15.4 million for the estimated impact of the Tax Act, which decreased our federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. The adjustments of $2.3 million and $15.4 million to deferred tax assets were reflected as credits and charges, respectively, to our income tax expense for 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

We also maintain a reserve related to certain tax positions that management believes contain an element of uncertainty. An uncertain tax position is measured based on the largest amount of benefit that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. During 2019, our income tax expense reflected an $31.1 million increase to our tax provision related to reserve for uncertain tax liability positions at December 31, 2019 as compared to a $3.3 million net tax benefit in 2018 related to the reduction of reserves caused by the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain tax positions. 

See Notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements and the "Executive Summary" and &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; sections in this MD&#38;A for an additional discussion on the accounting for income taxes. 

New Authoritative Accounting Guidance. See Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the dates of adoption and the anticipated effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 

Executive Summary 

Company Overview. At December 31, 2019 , Valley had consolidated total assets of $37.4 billion , total net loans of $29.5 billion , total deposits of $29.2 billion and total shareholders&#8217; equity of $4.4 billion . Our commercial bank operations include branch office locations in northern and central New Jersey, the New York City boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, Long Island, Florida and Alabama. Of our current 238 branch network, 59 percent , 16 percent , 18 percent and 7 percent of the branches are located in New Jersey, New York, Florida and Alabama, respectively. Despite our current and past branch consolidation activity, we have grown both in asset size and locations significantly over the past several years primarily through bank acquisitions. On January 1, 2018, Valley completed its acquisition of USAmeriBancorp, Inc. (USAB) and meaningfully enhanced its presence in the Tampa Bay, Florida market. USAB, largely through its wholly-owned subsidiary, USAmeriBank, had approximately $5.1 billion in assets, $3.7 billion in net loans and $3.6 billion in deposits. 

Acquisition of Oritani Financial Corp. Effective December 1, 2019, Valley completed its acquisition of Oritani Financial Corp. ("Oritani") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Oritani Bank. Oritani had approximately $4.3 billion in assets, $3.4 billion in net loans, $2.9 billion in deposits, after purchase accounting adjustments, and a branch network of 26 locations. The acquisition represents a significant addition to Valley's New Jersey franchise, and will meaningfully enhance its presence in the Bergen County market. The common shareholders of Oritani received 1.60 shares of Valley common stock for each Oritani share that they owned. The total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $835 million, and the transaction resulted in $289 million of goodwill and $21 million of core deposit intangible assets subject to amortization. Full systems integration was completed in February 2020 with minimal disruption to our customers. However, some normal post-systems integration matters involving back-office and other functions were still underway at the filing date of this report. 

We also closed and consolidated 6 of the 26 acquired Oritani branches into nearby legacy Valley branches during February 2020. Valley plans to close and consolidate three legacy Valley branches into branches acquired from Oritani during the second quarter 2020. We do not expect these branch closings to impact the timing of the planned closures discussed in the "Branch Transformation" section below. 

Branch Transformation. As previously disclosed, Valley has embarked on a strategy to overhaul its retail network. Approximately one year ago, we established the foundation of what the transformation of our branch network would look like in coming years. At that time, we identified 74 branches that did not meet certain internal performance measures, including 20 branches that were closed and consolidated by the end of the first quarter 2019. For the remaining 54 branches, we implemented tailored action plans focused on improving profitability and deposit levels, as well as upgrades in staffing and training, within a defined timeline. 

At December 31, 2019 , the majority of the 54 branches have seen measurable success in terms of relative cost of deposits, deposit mix and overall balance growth. However, some locations have not met our established performance targets. As such, we currently expect to close approximately 10 branches during 2020. 

##TABLE_START 2019 Form 10-K 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

For the remaining branch network, we continue to monitor the operating performance of each branch and implement tailored action plans focused on improving profitability and deposit levels for those branches that underperform. 

Sale Leaseback. During March 2019, Valley closed a sale-leaseback transaction for 26 properties resulting in a pre-tax gain of $78.5 million for the first quarter 2019. 

Investment in DC Solar Funds. From 2013 to 2015, Valley invested in three federal renewable energy tax credit funds sponsored by DC Solar and claimed the related federal tax credit benefits of approximately $22.8 million in its consolidated financial statements during these periods. In late February 2019, we learned of allegations of fraudulent conduct by DC Solar, including information about asset seizures of DC Solar property and assets of its principals and ongoing federal investigations. Since learning of the allegations, Valley has conducted an ongoing investigation coordinated with other DC Solar fund investors, investors' outside counsel and a third party specialist. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, given the circumstances that we were aware of at that time and management's best judgments regarding the settlement of the tax positions that it would ultimately accept with the IRS, Valley expected a partial loss and tax benefit recapture. During the fourth quarter 2019, several of the co-conspirators pleaded guilty to fraud in the on-going federal investigation. Based upon this new information, Valley deemed that its tax positions related to the DC Solar funds did not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold in Valley's tax reserve assessment at December 31, 2019. As a result, our net income for the fourth quarter 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2019 includes increases to our provision for income taxes of $18.7 million and $31.1 million, respectively, reflecting the reserve for uncertain tax liability positions related to renewable energy tax credits and other tax benefits previously recognized from the investments in the DC Solar funds plus interest. During the first quarter 2019, we also recognized a full write down of the related unamortized investments totaling $2.4 million (previously presented in other assets) due to other than temporary impairment losses. 

Valley believes it is fully reserved for its tax positions related to DC Solar at December 31, 2019. See Item 1A. Risk Factors as well as Notes 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our tax credit investments and reserves for uncertain tax liability positions. 

Annual Results . Net income totaled $309.8 million , or $0.87 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $261.4 million in 2018 , or $0.75 per diluted common share. The increase in net income was largely due to: (i) a $40.8 million , or 4.8 percent , increase in our net interest income driven by a $2.9 billion increase in average loan balances and higher loan yields, partially offset by interest expense related to higher short-term interest rates and a $2.4 billion increase in average interest bearing liabilities as compared to 2018 , (ii) a $80.5 million increase in non-interest income mostly related to a $78.5 million gain on the sale (and leaseback) of several Valley properties in the first quarter 2019, partially offset by (iii) a $78.7 million increase in income tax expense largely due to an increase in pre-tax income and a $31.1 million addition to our reserves for uncertain tax positions, (iv) a $8.3 million decline in our provision for credit losses and (v) a $2.5 million increase in total non-interest expense. See the &#8220;Net Interest Income,&#8221; &#8220;Non-Interest Income,&#8221; &#8220;Non-Interest Expense,&#8221; and &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; sections below for more details on the items above and other infrequent items, including merger expenses and the loss on extinguishment of debt, impacting our 2019 annual results. 

Operating Environment. During 2019, real gross domestic product expanded 2.3 percent as compared to 2.9 percent in 2018 due, in part, to weaker business fixed investment and a slower pace of services consumption by households. 

The federal funds target rate was increased five times by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) from mid-December 2017 to mid-December 2018. During 2019, the FOMC held the target range of 2.25 to 2.50 percent until the end of July 2019, and then cut the target three times to a range of 1.50 to 1.75 percent during the second half of 2019. In early March 2020, the FOMC cut interest rates by 50 basis points to a target range of 1.00 to 1.25 percent in an effort to contain the coronavirus's economic fallout. The interest rate cut was the first emergency rate move since the 2008 financial crisis. 

The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield ended 2019 at 1.92 percent, 77 basis points lower compared with December 31, 2018. The spread between the 2- and 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields ended the year at 0.34 percent, 13 basis points higher compared to the end of 2018. However, this spread has contracted during early March 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 and could remain that way for an extended period due to current economic concerns. 

For all commercial banks in the U.S., loans and leases grew approximately 4.2 percent from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. For the industry, banks reported that demand for most commercial loan products had declined compared to the end of 2018. The decline was driven by weakening demand among small firms for commercial and industrial loans and tightening of underwriting standards, particularly for commercial real estate loans.

Valley continued to see solid demand for commercial loans across its geographies during 2019, and was able to grow core deposits. However, should demand weaken for commercial loans and competition for deposits increase further in Valley's markets, these factors and others, including a flat or inverted yield curve environment, may challenge our business operations and results, as highlighted throughout the remaining MD&#38;A discussion below. 

Loans. Total loans increased by $4.7 billion to $29.7 billion at December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 . Adjusted for $3.4 billion of loans acquired from Oritani on December 1, 2019 and approximately $800 million of sales from the commercial real estate loan portfolio in the fourth quarter 2019, total loans grew by over 9 percent in 2019 due to strong demand in most loan categories. For 2020 , we are targeting net loan growth in the range of 6 to 8 percent. However, there can be no assurance that we will achieve such levels given the potential for unforeseen changes in the market and other conditions. See further details on our loan activities under the &#8220;Loan Portfolio&#8221; section below. 

Asset Quality. Our past due loans and non-accrual loans, discussed further below, exclude PCI loans. Under U.S. GAAP, the PCI loans (acquired at a discount that is due, in part, to credit quality) are accounted for on a pool basis and are not subject to delinquency classification in the same manner as loans originated by Valley. At December 31, 2019 , our PCI loan portfolio totaled $6.6 billion , or 22.3 percent of our total loan portfolio, and includes all of the loans acquired from USAB and Oritani on January 1, 2018 and December 1, 2019, respectively. 

Total non-PCI loan portfolio delinquencies (including loans past due 30 days or more and non-accrual loans) as a percentage of total loans were 0.54 percent and 0.62 percent at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Total accruing past due loans increased to $68.2 million at December 31, 2019 from $67.7 million at December 31, 2018 . Non-accrual loans totaled $ 93.1 million , or 0.31 percent of our entire loan portfolio of $29.7 billion , at December 31, 2019 as compared to $88.4 million , or 0.35 percent of total loans, at December 31, 2018 . The increase in non-accruals was largely due to a $6.6 million increase in commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in the commercial and industrial loan category. Overall, our non-performing assets increase d by 5.9 percent to $ 104.4 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $98.6 million at December 31, 2018 primarily due to the increase in non-accrual loans. 

Our lending strategy is based on underwriting standards designed to maintain high credit quality and we remain optimistic regarding the future performance of our loan portfolio. However, due to the potential for future credit deterioration caused by an unexpected downturn in economic conditions or other geopolitical factors, management cannot provide assurance that our non-performing assets will remain at, or increase from, the levels reported as of December 31, 2019 . See the &#8220;Non-performing Assets&#8221; section below for further analysis of our asset quality. 

Investments. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , we recognized net impairment losses on securities totaling $2.9 million in earnings due to one bond in default of its contractual payments. There were no net impairment losses on securities during 2018 and 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , we recognized net losses on securities transactions of $150 thousand as compared to net losses totaling $2.3 million in 2018 and $20 thousand in 2017 . The 2018 net losses were partly related to the sale of all the private label mortgage-backed securities classified as available for sale in our investment portfolio during the fourth quarter. See further details in the &#8220;Investment Securities Portfolio&#8221; section below and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Deposits and Other Borrowings . Our mix of total deposits slightly shifted to time deposits during 2019 as compared to 2018 largely due to the greater use of brokered time deposits since the second half of 2018 relative to other wholesale funding sources included in other borrowings. Non-interest bearing deposits represented approximately 25 percent of total average deposits for the year ended December 31, 2019 , while savings, NOW and money market accounts were 45 percent and time deposits were 30 percent. Average non-interest bearing deposits increase d $171.1 million to approximately $6.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 due, in large part, to our continuous efforts to encourage new and existing loan borrowers to maintain deposit accounts at Valley and, to a lesser extent, $142.6 million of deposits assumed from Oritani on December 1, 2019. Average savings, NOW and money market account balances increase d $312.9 million to $11.4 billion in 2019 largely due to several retail and business account initiatives and $1.6 billion of such deposits assumed from Oritani. Average time deposits also increase d $2.4 billion to $7.5 billion in 2019 due to (i) increased use of brokered CDs as an alternative to more costly FHLB borrowings with shorter or similar maturities, (ii) successful retail deposit gathering efforts and (iii) $1.2 billion of deposits assumed from USAB. Ending balances of brokered deposits (consisting of both time and money market deposit accounts) were $4.1 billion and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

Average short-term borrowings decrease d $117.7 million to $2.1 billion for 2019 as compared to 2018 largely due to a decline in FHLB advances used for funding of loan growth caused by the success of our retail and brokered deposit gathering efforts. Valley assumed only $10.5 million of very short duration borrowings in the Oritani acquisition during 2019. 

##TABLE_START 2019 Form 10-K 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

Average long-term borrowings decrease d $165.4 million to approximately $2.0 billion for 2019 as compared to 2018 largely due to an normal repayments of FHLB borrowings during 2019 and, to a much lesser extent, the prepayment of $635 million of high cost FHLB borrowings in December 2019. See further discussion of our average interest bearing liabilities under the &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221; section below. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income consists of interest income and dividends earned on interest earning assets less interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and represents the main source of income for Valley. The net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by average interest earning assets and is a key measurement used in the banking industry to measure income from interest earning assets. 

Annual Period 2019 . Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased by $39.8 million to $902.7 million for 2019 as compared to 2018 . The increase was mainly driven by a $2.9 billion increase in average loan balances and a 14 basis point increase in loan yield, partially offset by interest expense related to a $2.4 billion increase in average interest bearing liabilities and a 37 basis point increase in the cost of such liabilities as compared to 2018 . See further discussion of the changes in our average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities below. 

The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was 2.95 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019 and decrease d 16 basis points as compared to 2018 . However, the yield on average interest earning assets increased 13 basis points mainly attributable to the increased yield on average loans. The yield on average loans increased 14 basis points to 4.57 percent for 2019 as compared to 4.43 percent in 2018 largely due to new loan volumes and higher market interest rates in the second half of 2018 and a gradual decline in 2019 . Our average non-taxable investment portfolio yield decreased 30 basis points during 2019 as compared to one year ago due to repayment and prepayment of mostly higher yield residential mortgage-backed securities, increased premium amortization and lower yielding new investments in 2019 . Offsetting the increase in the yield on average interest earning assets, the cost of average interest bearing liabilities increase d 37 basis points to 1.84 percent for 2019 . The increase in the overall cost as compared to 2018 was mainly driven by higher market rates on most new stated rate maturity deposits and term funding in the second half of 2018 through approximately the first nine months of 2019 . The cost of funds were largely influenced by a 33 basis point increase in the annual average of the daily effective federal funds rate to 2.16 percent for 2019 from 1.83 percent in 2018 , as well as strong market competition for customer deposits. The federal funds target rate was increased five times by the FOMC from mid-December 2017 to mid-December 2018. In 2019, the FOMC held the target range of 2.25 to 2.50 percent until the end of July 2019, and then cut the target three times to a range of 1.50 to 1.75 percent during the second half of 2019. 

Average interest earning assets totaling $30.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 increase d $2.9 billion , or 10.4 percent, as compared to 2018 . Average loan balances increase d $2.9 billion to $26.2 billion in 2019 and drove approximately 80 percent of the $164.9 million increase in the interest income on a tax equivalent basis for loans as compared to 2018 . The growth in average loans during 2019 was mostly due to strong loan demand and successful lending team efforts, particularly in the commercial loan categories, over the last two years. The new loan production in the commercial area came from a blend of new and existing customer relationships with significant geographic and product diversification across our primary markets. Average federal funds sold and other interest bearing deposits increase d $79.8 million to $298.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 due to slightly higher levels of overnight liquidity primarily caused by fluctuations in the timing of new loan originations. Average investment securities decrease d $102.1 million to approximately $4.0 billion in 2019 due to normal securities repayment activity and higher reinvestment of such funds in new loan originations. 

Average interest bearing liabilities increase d $2.4 billion to $22.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 from the same period in 2018 due to increases in most of our deposit product categories. Average savings, NOW and money market accounts increased $312.9 million largely due to retail money market account gathering initiatives during late 2018 and 2019, partially offset by continued lower utilization of brokered money market account balances in our loan growth funding strategy and other liquidity needs in 2019 . Average time deposits increase d $2.4 billion to $7.5 billion for 2019 as compared to 2018 mainly due to retail CDs strategies executed in both 2018 and 2019 and increased use of brokered CDs since the second half of 2018. Average short-term and long-term borrowings decrease d $117.7 million and $165.4 million in 2019 , respectively, as compared to 2018 primarily due to a lower level of FHLB borrowings used to fund new loan activities. See the "Fourth Quarter 2019 " section below for more information regarding changes in our interest bearing liabilities during 2019 . 

Fourth Quarter 2019 . Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis totaling $239.6 million for the fourth quarter 2019 increased $16.2 million and $17.9 million as compared to the fourth quarter 2018 and third quarter 2019 , respectively. The increase compared to the third quarter 2019 was largely due to higher average loan balances and lower costs of interest-bearing liabilities, partly offset by low loan yields. Interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased $14.5 million to $344.8 million for the fourth quarter 2019 as compared to the third quarter 2019 mainly due to a $1.8 billion increase in average loans, partly offset by 6 basis point decrease in the yield on average loans. Interest expense of $105.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

2019 Form 10-K 

##TABLE_END

decreased $3.4 million from the third quarter 2019 largely due to lower interest rates on many of our interest-bearing deposit products and other borrowings, partly offset by additional interest expense from a $1.4 billion increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was largely driven by both brokered and retail time deposit gathering initiatives, as well as the Oritani acquisition. 

The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis of 2.96 percent for the fourth quarter 2019 decreased 14 basis points as compared to 3.10 percent for the fourth quarter 2018 , and increased 5 basis points from 2.91 percent for the third quarter 2019 . The yield on average interest earning assets decreased by 6 basis points on a linked quarter basis due to the lower yields on average loans and investment securities. The yield on average loans decreased to 4.51 percent for the fourth quarter 2019 from 4.57 percent for the third quarter 2019 mostly due to the high volume of new loan originations at current market rates and repayment of higher yielding loans. The decreased yield on average investment securities was partly caused by an increase in premium amortization on residential mortgage-backed securities, due to higher prepayments on such financial instruments. The overall cost of average interest-bearing liabilities decrease d by 16 basis points to 1.74 percent for the fourth quarter 2019 as compared to the linked third quarter 2019 due to lower interest rates on certain deposits and borrowings repricing during the second half of 2019. Our prepayment of $635 million in higher cost long-term borrowings during December 2019 is expected to positively impact our average cost of funds for its first full period of extinguishment during the first quarter 2020. Our cost of total average deposits was 1.20 percent for the fourth quarter 2019 as compared to 1.27 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2019 . 

Looking forward, we expect moderate interest rate pressures on the level of our net interest margin for the first quarter 2020 due to lower yielding loan originations and one less day during the quarter. However, we are encouraged by the current level of market interest rates for most of our funding sources and the potential ability to reprice stated maturity deposits and other borrowings coming due for us over the next 12-month period. Based upon our most recent projection, we anticipate net interest income growth of approximately 13 to 16 percent for the full year of 2020 as compared to 2019 .

Non-interest income represented 14.0 percent and 10.4 percent of total interest income plus non-interest income for 2019 and 2018 , respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , non-interest income increased $80.5 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 largely due to the gain on the sale of several Valley properties in 2019 .

##TABLE_END

Insurance commissions decreased $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $15.2 million in 2018 mainly due to lower volumes of business generated by the Bank's insurance agency subsidiary. 

Service charges on deposit accounts decreased $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 mostly due to lower checking and ATM fees. 

Net losses on securities transactions decreased $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 . The higher level of net losses in 2018 was partly due to the sale of all of our private label mortgage-backed securities classified as available for sale for an aggregate net loss of $1.5 million during the fourth quarter 2018, as well as the sale of equity securities previously classified as available for sale and certain municipal securities acquired from USAB. 

Other-than-temporary impairment losses on securities for the year ended December 31, 2019 relate to one special revenue bond in default of its contractual payments. See the &#8220;Investment Securities Portfolio&#8221; section of this MD&#38;A and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on our investment securities impairment analysis. 

Fees from loan servicing increased $475 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $9.3 million in 2018 mainly due to additional fees from mortgage servicing rights of loans originated and sold by us during the last 12 months. The aggregate principal balances of residential mortgage loans serviced by us for others increased approximately $113 million to $3.4 billion , at December 31, 2019 from $3.2 billion at December 31, 2018 . 

Net gains on sales of loans decreased $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 , largely due to lower volume of residential mortgage loan sales and interest rate spreads on loans sold. During 2019 , we sold $934.5 million of residential mortgages as compared to $965.5 million of residential mortgage loans sold during 2018 , including $436 million and $290 million of pre-existing loans sold from our residential mortgage loan portfolio, respectively. Residential mortgage loan originations (including both new and refinanced loans) decreased 9.2 percent to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $1.7 billion in 2018 . Our net gains on sales of loans for each period are comprised of both gains on sales of residential mortgages and the net change in the mark to market gains and losses on our loans held for sale carried at fair value at each period end. The net gains in the fair value of loans held for sale totaled $1.0 million and $211 thousand in 2019 and 2018 , respectively. See further discussions of our residential mortgage loan origination activity under &#8220;Loans&#8221; in the "Executive Summary" section of this MD&#38;A above and the fair valuation of our loans held for sale at Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements. 

Net gains (losses) on sales of assets increased $80.7 million primarily due to a $78.5 million gain on the sale (and leaseback) of 25 branches and 1 corporate location recognized during the first quarter 2019.

2019 Form 10-K 

##TABLE_END

Other non-interest income increased $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 2018 mainly due to a $17.0 million increase in fee income related to derivative interest rate swaps executed with commercial lending customers. Swap fee income totaled $33.4 million and $16.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The increase in swap fees was partially offset by a decrease in other income during 2019 related to a $6.5 million gain realized on the sale of our Visa Class B shares during the fourth quarter 2018. 

Non-Interest Expense 

Non-interest expense increased $2.5 million to $631.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 . The following table presents the components of non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : &#160;

##TABLE_END

Salary and employee benefits expense decreased $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 , largely due to (i) lower headcount caused by our recent branch transformation and new universal banker model, as well as other operational improvements, (ii) a $4.5 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, and (iii) a $2.8 million decrease in commission expense mainly related to our home mortgage consultant teams. These decreases were partially offset by higher merger related and other corporate severance expense. The change in control, severance and retention expenses related to bank acquisitions totaled $13.9 million and $9.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Severance costs related to our branch transformation strategy totaled $4.8 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

Net occupancy and equipment expenses increased $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 

largely due to higher rental expense resulting from the sale leaseback transaction for 26 locations closed during the first quarter 2019. In addition, repair and equipment expense, and depreciation expense increased $4.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 . Merger expenses related to bank acquisitions within the category totaled $870 thousand and $856 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

The FDIC insurance assessment decreased $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 largely due to the FDIC's termination of the large bank surcharge portion of our quarterly assessment effective September 30, 2018. 

Professional and legal fees decreased $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 . The decrease was mainly caused by a $12.2 million litigation reserve charge recognized in 2018. Professional and legal fees included merger expenses of approximately $1.9 million related to the Oritani acquisition and $837 thousand of merger expense related to the USAB acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

Loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 related to prepayment of $635.0 million of the long-term FHLB advances during the fourth quarter 2019 accounted for as an early debt extinguishment. See Note 11 for additional details. 

Amortization of tax credit investments decreased $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 mostly due to normal differences in the timing and amount of such investments and recognition of the related tax credits, partially offset by a $2.4 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to investments in three federal renewable energy tax credit funds during the year ended December 31, 2019 . Tax credit investments, while negatively impacting the level of our operating expenses and efficiency ratio, directly reduce our income tax expense and effective tax rate. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

##TABLE_START 2019 Form 10-K 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

Telecommunications expense decreased $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 partly due to branch reductions and other operating efficiencies. 

Other non-interest expense decreased $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 . The decrease was mainly due to $5.6 million of USAB merger related charges recognized during 2018 and a $1.4 million increase in net gains on sale of OREO properties. Merger expenses related to the Oritani acquisition were immaterial within other non-interest expense during 2019. Advertising expense included in this category decreased $1.3 million to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 . During 2019 , we also experienced moderate decreases in several other significant components of other expense, such as travel, debit card and ATM expense, postage, and stationery and print expenses. The positive impact of these items was partially offset by higher data processing costs during 2019 as compared to 2018. 

Efficiency Ratio. The efficiency ratio measures total non-interest expense as a percentage of net interest income plus total non-interest income. We believe this non-GAAP measure provides a meaningful comparison of our operational performance and facilitates investors&#8217; assessments of business performance and trends in comparison to our peers in the banking industry. Our overall efficiency ratio, and its comparability to some of our peers, is negatively impacted mostly by the loss on extinguishment of debt, amortization of tax credit investments, merger related expenses, and the gain on our sale-leaseback transaction during 2019. See table below for more details. 

The following table presents our efficiency ratio and a reconciliation of the efficiency ratio adjusted for such items during the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : &#160;

our previously announced goal of 55 percent or lower for the year. Valley expects to achieve an adjusted efficiency ratio of 51 percent or lower for the full year of 2020 as it remains committed to technology and business process enhancements throughout the organization. However, we can provide no assurance that our adjusted efficiency ratio will meet our target for 2020 or remain at the level reported for 2019 . 

Income Taxes 

Effective January 1, 2018, the federal corporate income tax rate decreased from 35 percent to 21 percent under the Tax Act. Income tax expense was $147.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 , reflecting an effective tax rate of 32.2 percent , as compared to $68.3 million for the year ended 2018 , reflecting an effective tax rate of 20.7 percent . The increase in both income tax expense and the effective tax rate in 2019 as compared to 2018 was largely caused by an $31.2 million increase in Valley's reserve for uncertain tax liability positions at December 31, 2019 related to renewable energy tax credits and other tax benefits previously recognized from the investments in the DC Solar funds plus interest. As a result, Valley believes it is fully reserved for its tax positions related to DC Solar at December 31, 2019. In addition, the income tax expense and effective tax rate for 2018 reflect a net tax benefit of $3.3 million related to the reduction in our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain tax positions. 

U.S. GAAP requires that any change in judgment or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period be recognized as a discrete event in the quarter in which it occurs, rather than being recognized as a change in effective tax rate for the current year. Our adherence to these tax guidelines may result in volatile effective income tax rates in future quarterly and annual periods. Factors that could impact management&#8217;s judgment include changes in income, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning strategies. Based on the current information available, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will range from 24 percent to 26 percent for 2020 . 

See additional information regarding our income taxes under our &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#8221; section above, as well as Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Business Segments 

We have four business segments that we monitor and report on to manage our business operations. These segments are consumer lending, commercial lending, investment management, and corporate and other adjustments. Our reportable segments have been determined based upon Valley&#8217;s internal structure of operations and lines of business. Each business segment is reviewed routinely for its asset growth, contribution to income before income taxes and return on average interest earning assets and impairment (if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount). Expenses related to the branch network, all other components of retail banking, along with the back office departments of our subsidiary bank are allocated from the corporate and other adjustments segment to each of the other three business segments. Interest expense and internal transfer expense (for general corporate expenses) are allocated to each business segment utilizing a &#8220;pool funding&#8221; methodology, which involves the allocation of uniform funding cost based on each segments&#8217; average earning assets outstanding for the period. The financial reporting for each segment contains allocations and reporting in line with our operations, which may not necessarily be comparable to any other financial institution. The accounting for each segment includes internal accounting policies designed to measure consistent and reasonable financial reporting, and may result in income and expense measurements that differ from amounts under U.S. GAAP. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for the segments&#8217; financial data. 

Consumer lending. The consumer lending segment representing 24.3 percent of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 , is mainly comprised of residential mortgage loans and automobile loans, and to a lesser extent, home equity loans, secured personal lines of credit and other consumer loans (including credit card loans).The duration of the residential mortgage loan portfolio (which represented 14.7 percent of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 ) is subject to movements in the market level of interest rates and forecasted prepayment speeds. The weighted average life of the automobile loans portfolio (representing 4.9 percent of total loans at December 31, 2019 ) is relatively unaffected by movements in the market level of interest rates. However, the average life may be impacted by new loans as a result of the availability of credit within the automobile marketplace and consumer demand for purchasing new or used automobiles. The consumer lending segment also includes the Wealth Management Division, comprised of trust, asset management, and insurance services. 

Average interest earning assets in this segment increased $694.3 million to $6.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 . The increase was largely due to loan growth from new and refinanced residential mortgage loan originations held for investment generated from our home mortgage consulting team, moderately low level of market mortgage interest rates, and strength of the labor markets, net of loan portfolio transfers and sales in 2019. Automobile loans and other 

##TABLE_START 2019 Form 10-K 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

consumer loans (mainly consisting of collateralized personal lines of credits) also grew by 10.0 percent and 6.1 percent , respectively, over the last 12 months. 

Income before income taxes generated by the consumer lending segment increased $20.2 million to $77.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $57.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 , largely due to lower non-interest expense coupled with an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest income. Non-interest expense decreased $16.4 million as compared to 2018 due, in part, to lower salary and employee benefits expense. Net interest income increase d $9.8 million mostly due to the increase in average loans. The decrease of $3.3 million in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was largely due to lower insurance commissions generated by the Wealth Management Division and a moderate decline in net gains of sale of residential mortgage loans. 

The net interest margin on the consumer lending portfolio was 2.63 percent and 2.77 percent for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. The 2019 margin decreased 14 basis points from 2018 due to a 30 basis point increase in the costs associated with our funding sources, partially offset by 16 basis point increase in the yield on average loans. The increase in our cost of funds was primarily due to greater use of brokered and retail time deposit funding in our overall mix of deposit balances and higher rates on most deposit products and wholesale borrowings during the first half of 2019. See the "Executive Summary" and the "Net Interest Income" sections above for more details on our loans, deposits and other borrowings. 

The return on average interest earning assets before income taxes for the consumer lending segment was 1.12 percent for 2019 compared to 0.92 percent for 2018 . 

Commercial lending. The commercial lending segment is mainly comprised of floating rate and adjustable rate commercial and industrial loans and construction loans, as well as fixed rate owner occupied and commercial real estate loans. Due to the portfolio&#8217;s interest rate characteristics, commercial lending is Valley&#8217;s business segment that is most sensitive to movements in market interest rates. Commercial and industrial loans totaled approximately $4.8 billion and represented 16.2 percent of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 . Commercial real estate loans and construction loans totaled $17.6 billion and represented 59.5 percent of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 . 

Average interest earning assets in this segment increased $2.2 billion to $19.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 . The average increase was primarily attributable to solid organic loan growth during both 2019 and 2018. 

For the year ended December 31, 2019 , income before income taxes for the commercial lending segment increased $60.8 million to $369.2 million as compared to 2018 . Net interest income increased $47.0 million to $668.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 largely due to higher average balances and an increase in yield on new loan originations, partially offset by higher interest expense. Non-interest income increased $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 mainly due to fee income related to derivative interest rate swaps executed with commercial loan customers which totaled $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $16.4 million in 2018 . The provision for credit losses decreased $9.4 million to $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 . (See details in the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section of this MD&#38;A). Internal transfer expense and non-interest expense increased $7.7 million and $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 , respectively, as compared to 2018 . 

The net interest margin for this segment decreased 17 basis points to 3.46 percent during 2019 as a result of a 30 basis point increase in the cost of our funding sources, partially offset by a 13 basis point increase in the yield on average loans as compared to 2018 . The increase in yield on average loans was largely due to new loan volumes at higher market interest rates in the second half of 2018 and a gradual decline in the new loan interest rates in 2019 . 

The return on average interest earning assets before income taxes for this segment was 1.91 percent for 2019 compared to 1.80 percent for the prior year period. 

Investment management. The investment management segment generates a large portion of our income through investments in various types of securities and interest-bearing deposits with other banks. These investments are mainly comprised of fixed rate securities and, depending on our liquid cash position, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks (primarily the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) as part of our asset/liability management strategies. The fixed rate investments are one of Valley&#8217;s least sensitive assets to changes in market interest rates. However, a portion of the investment portfolio is invested in shorter-duration securities to maintain the overall asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. See the &#8220;Asset/Liability Management&#8221; section below for further analysis. 

Average interest earning assets decreased $22.3 million to $4.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 mostly due to a decline of $102.1 million in average investment securities partially offset by a $79.8 million increase in federal funds sold and other interest bearing deposits. Average investments declined due to the reinvestment of normal cash flows into higher yielding new loan activity in 2019. Average federal funds sold and other interest bearing deposits increase d to $298.7 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

2019 Form 10-K 

##TABLE_END

million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 due to higher levels of overnight liquidity primarily caused by normal fluctuations in the timing of new loan originations and other treasury management activity. 

For the year ended December 31, 2019 , income before income taxes for the investment management segment decreased $11.9 million to $27.0 million as compared to 2018 primarily due to a $17.0 million decrease in net interest income, partially offset by a $4.7 million decrease in the internal transfer expense. The decrease in net interest income was mainly driven by lower average investment balances and normal repayment of higher yielding securities during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 . 

The net interest margin for this segment decreased 38 basis points to 1.59 percent during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 as a result of a 30 basis point increase in costs associated with our funding sources and an 8 basis point decrease in the yield on average investments. The decrease in the yield on average investments during 2019 as compared to one year ago was mainly due to repayment and prepayment of mostly higher yield residential mortgage-backed securities, increased premium amortization and lower yielding new investments purchased during 2019 . 

The return on average interest earning assets before income taxes for this segment was 0.62 percent for 2019 compared to 0.89 percent for 2018 . 

Corporate and other adjustments. The amounts disclosed as &#8220;corporate and other adjustments&#8221; represent income and expense items not directly attributable to a specific segment, including net gains and losses on securities and net impairment losses not reported in the investment management segment above, interest expense related to subordinated notes, amortization of tax credit investments , as well as infrequent items, such as the loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on sale leaseback transactions and merger expenses. 

The pre-tax net loss for the corporate segment decreased $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $17.0 million as compared to $75.0 million in 2018 . The lower net loss during 2019 for this segment was mainly due to a increase in non-interest income, as well as internal transfer income, partially offset by a increase in non-interest expense. The non-interest income increased $64.8 million to $106.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 2018 primarily due to a $78.5 million net gain on the sale (and leaseback) of 26 Valley properties during the first quarter 2019. Internal transfer income increased $4.6 million to $349.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year. The non-interest expense increased $12.4 million to $452.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 largely due to a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $32.0 million for 2019, partially offset by decreases in several items, including professional and legal fees. See further details in the "Non-Interest Expense" section in this MD&#38;A. 

ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT 

Interest Rate Sensitivity 

Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk. Interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to the movement in interest rates. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for managing such risks and establishing policies that monitor and coordinate our sources and uses of funds. Asset/Liability management is a continuous process due to the constant change in interest rate risk factors. In assessing the appropriate interest rate risk levels for us, management weighs the potential benefit of each risk management activity within the desired parameters of liquidity, capital levels and management&#8217;s tolerance for exposure to income fluctuations. Many of the actions undertaken by management utilize fair value analysis and attempts to achieve consistent accounting and economic benefits for financial assets and their related funding sources. We have predominately focused on managing our interest rate risk by attempting to match the inherent risk and cash flows of financial assets and liabilities. Specifically, management employs multiple risk management activities such as optimizing the level of new residential mortgage originations retained in our mortgage portfolio through increasing or decreasing loan sales in the secondary market, product pricing levels, the desired maturity levels for new originations, the composition levels of both our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, as well as several other risk management activities. 

We use a simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates. The simulation model projects net interest income based on various interest rate scenarios over a 12-month and 24-month period. The model is based on the actual maturity and re-pricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities. The model incorporates certain assumptions which management believes to be reasonable regarding the impact of changing interest rates and the prepayment assumptions of certain assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019 . The model assumes changes in interest rates without any proactive change in the composition or size of the balance sheet by management. In the model, the forecasted shape of the yield curve remains static as of December 31, 2019 . The impact of interest rate derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, is also included in the model. 

Our simulation model is based on market interest rates and prepayment speeds prevalent in the market as of December 31, 2019 . Although the size of Valley&#8217;s balance sheet is forecasted to remain static as of December 31, 2019 , in our model, the composition 

##TABLE_START 2019 Form 10-K 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

is adjusted to reflect new interest earning assets and funding originations coupled with rate spreads utilizing our actual originations during 2019 . The model utilizes an immediate parallel shift in the market interest rates at December 31, 2019 . 

The assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the table above, due to the frequency and timing of changes in interest rates, and changes in spreads between maturity and re-pricing categories. Overall, our net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and cash flows from our loan and investment portfolios. We actively manage these cash flows in conjunction with our liability mix, duration and interest rates to optimize the net interest income, while structuring the balance sheet in response to actual or potential changes in interest rates. Additionally, our net interest income is impacted by the level of competition within our marketplace. Competition can negatively impact the level of interest rates attainable on loans and increase the cost of deposits, which may result in downward pressure on our net interest margin in future periods. Other factors, including, but not limited to, the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows will impact our net interest income results and may increase or decrease the level of asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. 

Convexity is a measure of how the duration of a financial instrument changes as market interest rates change. Potential movements in the convexity of bonds held in our investment portfolio, as well as the duration of the loan portfolio may have a positive or negative impact on our net interest income in varying interest rate environments. As a result, the increase or decrease in forecasted net interest income may not have a linear relationship to the results reflected in the table above. Management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income. 

The following table reflects management&#8217;s expectations of the change in our net interest income over the next 12-month period in light of the aforementioned assumptions. While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this simulation model, we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact than shown in the table below. &#160;

##TABLE_END

As noted in the table above, a 100 basis point immediate decrease in interest rates combined with a static balance sheet where the size, mix, and proportions of assets and liabilities remain unchanged is projected to increase net interest income over the next 12 months by 3.19 percent . This is primarily due to a significant volume of term retail deposit funding that will reprice lower over the next 12 months. Valley's sensitivity to changes in market rates as compared to December 31, 2018 (which projected a decrease of 0.49 percent in net interest income over a 12-month period) increased partly due to changes in balance sheet structure related to funding composition and a slightly longer asset duration. Management believes the interest rate sensitivity remains within an acceptable tolerance range at December 31, 2019. However, the level of net interest income sensitivity may increase or decrease in the future as a result of changes in deposit and borrowings strategies, the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows.

##TABLE_END

The above table provides an approximation of the projected re-pricing of assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019 on the basis of contractual maturities, adjusted for anticipated prepayments of principal (including anticipated call dates on long-term borrowings and junior subordinated debentures), and scheduled rate adjustments. The prepayment experience reflected herein is based on historical experience combined with market consensus expectations derived from independent external sources. The actual repayments of these instruments could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from historical experience or current market expectations. While all non-maturity deposit liabilities are reflected in the 2019 column in the table above, management controls the re-pricing of the vast majority of the interest-bearing instruments within these liabilities. 

Our cash flow derivatives are designed to protect us from upward movement in interest rates on certain deposits and other borrowings. The interest rate sensitivity table reflects the sensitivity at current interest rates. As a result, the notional amount of our derivatives is not included in the table. We use various assumptions to estimate fair values. See Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements. 

The total gap re-pricing within one year as of December 31, 2019 was a negative $12.6 billion , representing a ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities of 0.44:1 . The total gap re-pricing position, as reported in the table above, reflects the projected interest rate sensitivity of our principal cash flows based on market conditions as of December 31, 2019 . As the market level of interest rates and associated prepayment speeds move, the total gap re-pricing position will change accordingly, but not likely in a linear relationship. Management does not view our one-year gap position as of December 31, 2019 as presenting an unusually high risk potential, although no assurances can be given that we are not at risk from interest rate increases or decreases.

Liquidity 

Bank Liquidity. Liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due. A bank&#8217;s liquidity reflects its ability to meet loan demand, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate opportunities in the marketplace. Liquidity management is carefully performed and reported by our Treasury Department to two Board committees. Among other actions, Treasury reviews historical funding requirements, current liquidity position, sources and stability of funding, marketability of assets, options for attracting additional funds, and anticipated future funding needs, including the level of unfunded commitments. Our goal is to maintain sufficient liquidity to cover current and potential funding requirements. 

The Bank has no required regulatory liquidity ratios to maintain; however, it adheres to an internal liquidity policy. The current policy requires that we may not have a ratio of loans to deposits in excess of 125 percent or reliance on wholesale funding greater than 27.5 percent of total funding. The Bank was in compliance with the foregoing policies at December 31, 2019 . 

On the asset side of the balance sheet, the Bank has numerous sources of liquid funds in the form of cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks (including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York), investment securities held to maturity that are maturing within 90 days or would otherwise qualify as maturities if sold (i.e., 85 percent of original cost basis has been repaid), investment securities available for sale, loans held for sale, and, from time to time, federal funds sold and receivables related to unsettled securities transactions. Our equities securities carried at fair value are restricted assets held for certain Valley obligations at December 31, 2019 and unavailable as liquidity sources. Liquid assets totaled approximately $2.2 billion , representing 6.4 percent of earning assets, at December 31, 2019 and $2.3 billion , representing 8.0 percent of earning assets, at December 31, 2018 . Of the $2.2 billion of liquid assets at December 31, 2019 , approximately $1.0 billion of various investment securities were pledged to counterparties to support our earning asset funding strategies. We anticipate the receipt of approximately $1.2 billion in principal from securities in the total investment portfolio over the next 12 months due to normally scheduled principal repayments and expected prepayments of certain securities, primarily residential mortgage-backed securities. 

Additional liquidity is derived from scheduled loan payments of principal and interest, as well as prepayments received. Loan principal payments (including loans held for sale at December 31, 2019 ) are projected to be approximately $8.6 billion over the next 12 months. As a contingency plan for significant funding needs, liquidity could also be derived from the sale of conforming residential mortgages from our loan portfolio, or from the temporary curtailment of lending activities. 

On the liability side of the balance sheet, we utilize multiple sources of funds to meet liquidity needs, including retail and commercial deposits, brokered and municipal deposits, and short-term and long-term borrowings. Our core deposit base, which generally excludes fully insured brokered deposits and both retail and brokered certificates of deposit over $250 thousand , represents the largest of these sources. Average core deposits totaled approximately $20.4 billion and $18.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, representing 66.8 percent and 65.3 percent of average earning assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The level of interest bearing deposits is affected by interest rates offered, which is often influenced by our need for funds and the need to match the maturities of assets and liabilities. 

The following table lists, by maturity, all certificates of deposit of $250 thousand and over at December 31, 2019 : &#160;

Additional funding may be provided from short-term liquidity borrowings through deposit gathering networks and in the form of federal funds purchased obtained through our well established relationships with several correspondent banks. While there are no firm lending commitments currently in place, management believes that we could borrow approximately $1.0 billion for a short time from these banks on a collective basis. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and has the ability to borrow from them in the form of FHLB advances secured by pledges of certain eligible collateral, including but not limited to U.S. government and agency mortgage-backed securities and a blanket assignment of qualifying first lien mortgage loans, consisting of both residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans. Furthermore, we are able to obtain overnight borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York via the discount window as a contingency for additional liquidity. At December 31, 2019 , our borrowing capacity under the Federal Reserve Bank's discount window was approximately $1.8 billion . 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

2019 Form 10-K 

##TABLE_END

We also have access to other short-term and long-term borrowing sources to support our asset base, such as repos (i.e., securities sold under agreements to repurchase). Short-term borrowings (consisting of FHLB advances, repos, and from time to time, federal funds purchased) decreased $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2018 largely due to a decrease of $792 million in FHLB advances and lower repo and federal funds purchased balances. The change in short-term borrowings is generally driven by the levels of loan originations both for investment and sale, the success of our deposit gathering initiatives (including brokered deposits) and changes in long-term borrowings used in our current liquidity/funding strategies. 

Average short-term FHLB advances exceeded 30 percent of total shareholders' equity at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The following table sets forth information regarding Valley&#8217;s short-term FHLB advances at the dates and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 :

Corporation Liquidity. Valley&#8217;s recurring cash requirements primarily consist of dividends to preferred and common shareholders and interest expense on subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts. As part of our on-going asset/liability management strategies, Valley could also use cash to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock under its share repurchase program or redeem its callable junior subordinated debentures. These cash needs are routinely satisfied by dividends collected from the Bank. Projected cash flows from the Bank are expected to be adequate to pay preferred and common dividends, if declared, and interest expense payable to subordinated note holders and capital trusts, given the current capital levels and current profitable operations of the bank subsidiary. In addition to dividends received from the Bank, Valley can satisfy its cash requirements by utilizing its own cash and potential new funds borrowed from outside sources or capital issuances. Valley also has the right to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures, and therefore distributions on its trust preferred securities for consecutive quarterly periods up to five years, but not beyond the stated maturity dates, and subject to other conditions. 

Investment Securities Portfolio 

The primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to provide a source of earnings, be a source of liquidity, and serve as a tool for managing interest rate risk. The decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of long and short-term economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate environment and other statement of financial condition components. See additional information under "Interest Rate Sensitivity", "Liquidity" and "Capital Adequacy" sections elsewhere in this MD&#38;A. 

As of December 31, 2019 , our investment portfolio was comprised of equity securities (consisting of a money market mutual fund), U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, taxable and tax-exempt issues of states and political subdivisions, residential mortgage-backed securities, single-issuer trust preferred securities principally issued by bank holding companies and high quality corporate bonds. There were no securities in the name of any one issuer exceeding 10 percent of shareholders&#8217; equity, except for residential mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae and Fannie Mae. Securities with limited marketability and/or restrictions, such as Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank stocks, are carried at cost and are included in other assets. 

Among other securities, our investments in trust preferred securities, bank issued corporate bonds and special revenue bonds may pose a higher risk of future impairment charges to us as a result of the uncertain economic environment and its potential negative effect on the future performance of the security issuers.

Equity securities at December 31, 2017 were reclassified from available for sale securities to conform to the current presentation in accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 adopted on January 1, 2018. 

##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2019 , total investments increased $126.5 million or 3.3 percent as compared to 2018 largely due to a combined net increase of $178.4 million in residential mortgage-backed securities classified as held for maturity and available for sale and a $41.4 million increase in equity securities, partially offset by a combined $112.0 million decrease in obligations of states and state agencies classified as held to maturity and available for sale. The net increase in total residential mortgage-backed securities was mainly driven by purchases of Ginnie Mae and Fannie Mae securities classified as held to maturity and securities acquired from Oritani classified as available for sale that were offset by a high level of paydowns during 2019. We acquired $335.9 million of available for sale debt securities from Oritani, consisting mostly of residential mortgage-backed securities. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The decrease in obligations of states and state agencies from 2018 was largely a result of a high level of calls and redemptions within the held for maturity portfolio during 2019. 

At December 31, 2019 , we had $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion of residential mortgage-backed securities classified as held to maturity and available for sale, respectively. Approximately 56 percent and 66 percent of these residential mortgage-backed securities, respectively, were issued and guaranteed by Ginnie Mae. The remainder of our outstanding residential mortgage-backed security balances at December 31, 2019 were issued by either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

Residential mortgage-backed securities are shown using stated final maturity. 

##TABLE_END The residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio is a significant source of our liquidity through the monthly cash flow of principal and interest. Mortgage-backed securities, like all securities, are sensitive to change in the interest rate environment, increasing and decreasing in value as interest rates fall and rise. As interest rates fall, the potential increase in prepayments can reduce the yield on the mortgage-backed securities portfolio, and reinvestment of the proceeds will be at lower yields. Conversely, rising interest rates may reduce cash flows from prepayments and extend anticipated duration of these assets. We monitor the changes in interest rates, cash flows and duration, in accordance with our investment policies. Management seeks out investment securities with an attractive spread over our cost of funds. 

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Analysis 

We may be required to record impairment charges on our investment securities if they suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. Numerous factors, including lack of liquidity for re-sales of certain investment securities, absence of reliable pricing information for investment securities, adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, or unanticipated changes in the competitive environment could have a negative effect on our investment portfolio and may result in other-than temporary impairment on our investment securities in future periods. For debt securities, the primary consideration in determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary is whether or not Valley expects to collect all contractual cash flows.

The investment grades in the table below reflect the most current independent analysis performed by third parties of each security as of the date presented and not necessarily the investment grades at the date of our purchase of the securities. For many securities, the rating agencies may not have performed an independent analysis of the tranches owned by us, but rather an analysis of the entire investment pool. For this and other reasons, we believe the assigned investment grades may not accurately reflect the actual credit quality of each security and should not be viewed in isolation as a measure of the quality of our investment portfolio. 

See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our other-than-temporary impairment analysis.

Rated using external rating agencies. Ratings categories include entire range. For example, &#8220;A Rated&#8221; includes A+, A, and A-. Split rated securities with two ratings are categorized at the higher of the rating levels. 

##TABLE_END The unrealized losses in the AAA rated category for both available for sale and held to maturity investment debt securities presented in the table above are mostly related to residential mortgage-backed securities primarily issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The held to maturity portfolio includes $108.4 million in investments not rated by the rating agencies with aggregate unrealized losses of $6.5 million at December 31, 2019 . The unrealized losses for this category included $6.0 million of unrealized losses related to four single-issuer bank trust preferred issuances with a combined amortized cost of $36.0 million . All single-issuer bank trust preferred securities classified as held to maturity, including the aforementioned four securities, are paying in accordance with their terms and have no deferrals of interest or defaults. Additionally, we analyze the performance of each issuer on a quarterly basis, including a review of performance data from the issuer&#8217;s most recent bank regulatory report to assess the company&#8217;s credit risk and the probability of impairment of the contractual cash flows of the applicable security. Based upon our quarterly review at December 31, 2019 , all of the issuers appear to meet the regulatory capital minimum requirements to be considered a &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; financial institution and/or have maintained performance levels adequate to support the contractual cash flows of the security. 

During 2019, Valley recognized a $2.9 million other-than-temporary credit impairment charge on one special revenue bond classified as available for sale (within the obligations of states and state agencies in the tables above). The credit impairment was due to severe credit deterioration disclosed by the issuer in the second quarter 2019, as well as the issuer's default on its contractual payment. At December 31, 2019 , the impaired security had an adjusted amortized cost and fair value of $680 thousand . Comparatively, there was no other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 . During the fourth quarter 2018, we sold all of our private label mortgage-backed securities classified as available for sale, including securities that were previously impaired and rated non-investment grade, for an aggregate net loss of $1.5 million.

Total loans are net of unearned premiums and deferred loan costs of $12.6 million , $21.5 million , $22.2 million , $15.3 million, and $3.5 million at December 31, 2019 , 2018 , 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively. 

##TABLE_END Total loans increased by $4.7 billion , or 18.6 percent to $29.7 billion at December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 . Adjusted for $3.2 billion of acquired Oritani loan balances as of December 31, 2019 and the $800 million of commercial real estate loans sold, total loans grew by 8.8 percent in 2019 due to strong demand in most loan categories as discussed further below. During 2019 , Valley also originated $538.0 million of residential mortgage loans for sale. Loans held for sale totaled $76.1 million and $35.2 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. See additional information regarding our residential mortgage loan activities below. 

Our loan portfolio includes PCI loans, which are loans acquired at a discount that is due, in part, to credit quality. At December 31, 2019 , our PCI loan portfolio increased $2.4 billion to $6.6 billion as compared to December 31, 2018 primarily due to the PCI loan classification of all the loans acquired from Oritani on December 1, 2019, partially offset by normal loan repayments. 

Commercial and industrial loans totaled $4.8 billion at December 31, 2019 and increased by $495.0 million from December 31, 2018 mainly due to a $553.6 million increase in the non-PCI loan portfolio, partially offset by $58.6 million decrease in PCI loans. The increase in non-PCI loans was due to strong organic growth mostly driven by new small to middle market lending relationships within our markets aided by our ability to hire strong lending talent and the success of focused calling efforts in 2019. In addition, our premium finance division grew by approximately $41 million during 2019 from a year ago. Commercial and industrial loans acquired from Oritani during the fourth quarter 2019 were not material. 

Commercial real estate loans (excluding construction loans) increased $3.6 billion to $16.0 billion at December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 mainly due to $3.0 billion of PCI loans acquired from Oritani and a $1.0 billion increase in the non-PCI loan portfolio, partly offset by normal PCI loan repayments. The increase in non-PCI loans was primarily due to strong organic loan volumes generated across a broad-based segment of borrowers within the commercial real estate portfolio mainly from new and pre-exiting relationships in our Florida market area, as well as targeted growth in New Jersey and New York and some migration of completed construction projects to permanent financing during 2019. The increase in non-PCI loans was partially offset by the aforementioned sale of approximately $800 million of commercial real estate loans, mostly within New York City during the fourth quarter 2019. Construction loans totaled $1.6 billion at December 31, 2019 and increased $158.9 million from December 31, 2018 . Exclusive of a $214.5 million decline in PCI loans, the non-PCI construction loans increased $373.4 million or 33.3 percent largely 

##TABLE_START 2019 Form 10-K 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

due to strong demand for investor occupied projects within our primary markets, and to a lesser extent, migration of completed construction projects to permanent financing. 

Residential mortgage loans totaled $4.4 billion at December 31, 2019 and increased by $265.7 million from December 31, 2018 partly due to a $114.0 million increase in our non-PCI loans. Our PCI loans increased $151.7 million largely due to $248.3 million of loans acquired from Oritani, net of normal repayment activity. Our new and refinanced residential mortgage loan originations decreased 9.2 percent to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $1.7 billion in 2018 . Of the $1.6 billion in total originations, $333 million represented Florida residential mortgage loans. During 2019 , we sold $934.5 million of residential mortgages as compared to $965.5 million of residential mortgage loans sold during 2018 , including $436 million and $290 million of pre-existing loans sold from our residential mortgage loan portfolio, respectively. We retain mortgage originations based on credit criteria and loan to value levels, the composition of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and our ability to manage the interest rate risk associated with certain levels of these instruments. From time to time, we purchase residential mortgage loans originated by, and sometimes serviced by, other financial institutions based on several factors, including current loan origination volumes, market interest rates, excess liquidity, CRA and other asset/liability management strategies. Purchased residential mortgage loans are generally selected using Valley&#8217;s normal underwriting criteria at the time of purchase and are sometimes partially or fully guaranteed by third parties or insured by government agencies such as the Federal Housing Administration. Valley purchased approximately $35 million and $105 million of 1-4 family loans, qualifying for CRA purposes during 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

Consumer loans totaled $2.9 billion at December 31, 2019 and increased $154.7 million from December 31, 2018 mainly due to increases in automobile and secured personal lines of credit, partially offset by a decrease in the home equity loan portfolio. Automobile loans increased $132.1 million or 10.0 percent to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily due to higher indirect auto application activity during 2019 . Additionally, our Florida dealership network contributed over $169 million in auto loan originations, representing approximately 23 percent of Valley's total new auto loan production for 2019 as compared to $155 million, or 24 percent, of total originations in 2018. Other consumer loans increased $52.5 million to $913.4 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 largely due to continued strong growth and customer usage of collateralized personal lines of credit that allow the customer to manage their liquidity needs by accessing the cash value of their whole life insurance policy. Home equity loans decreased $29.8 million in 2019 from $517.1 million at December 31, 2018 . The modest organic growth of $4.7 million in non-PCI loans during 2019 was more than offset by $34.5 million decline in PCI loans caused by normal repayments. 

For 2020 , we anticipate overall loan portfolio growth in the range of 6 to 8 percent. However, there can be no assurance that we will achieve such levels, or balances will not decline from December 31, 2019 given the potential for unforeseen changes in consumer confidence, the economy and other market conditions. 

Most of our lending is in northern and central New Jersey, New York City, Long Island, and Florida, with the exception of smaller auto and residential mortgage loan portfolios derived primarily from other neighboring states of New Jersey, which could present a geographic and credit risk if there was another significant broad-based economic downturn within these regions. To mitigate our geographic risks, we make efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio as to type of borrower and loan to guard against a potential downward turn in any one economic sector.

We may renew loans at maturity when requested by a customer. In such instances, we generally conduct a review which includes an analysis of the borrower&#8217;s financial condition and, if applicable, a review of the adequacy of collateral via a new appraisal from an independent, bank approved, certified or licensed property appraiser or readily available market resources. A rollover of the loan at maturity may require a principal reduction or other modified terms.

Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans 

PCI loans increased $2.4 billion to $6.6 billion at December 31, 2019 from $4.2 billion at December 31, 2018 mainly due to $3.4 billion of PCI loans acquired from Oritani on December 1, 2019, partially offset by normal repayment activity. Our PCI loans almost entirely include loans acquired in business combinations subsequent to 2011. 

As required by U.S. GAAP, all of our PCI loans are accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30. This accounting guidance requires the PCI loans to be aggregated and accounted for as pools of loans based on common risk characteristics. A pool is accounted for as one asset with a single composite interest rate, aggregate fair value and expected cash flows. For PCI loan pools accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30, the difference between the contractually required payments due and the cash flows expected to be collected, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the non-accretable difference. The contractually required payments due represent the total undiscounted amount of all uncollected principal and interest payments. Contractually required payments due may increase or decrease for a variety of reasons, e.g. when the contractual terms of the loan agreement are modified, when interest rates on variable rate loans change, or when principal and/or interest payments are received. The Bank estimates the undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected by incorporating several key assumptions, including probability of default, loss given default, and the amount of actual prepayments after the acquisition dates. The non-accretable difference, which is neither accreted into income nor recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, reflects estimated future credit losses and uncollectable contractual interest expected to be incurred over the life of the loans. The excess of the undiscounted cash flows expected at the acquisition date over the carrying amount (fair value) of the PCI loans is referred to as the accretable yield. This amount is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loans, or pool of loans, using the level yield method. The accretable yield is affected by changes in interest rate indices for variable rate loans, changes in prepayment assumptions, and changes in expected principal and interest payments over the estimated lives of the loans. Prepayments affect the estimated life of PCI loans and could change the amount of interest income, and possibly principal, expected to be collected. Reclassifications of the non-accretable difference to the accretable yield may occur subsequent to the loan acquisition dates due to increases in expected cash flows of the loan pools. 

At acquisition, we use a third party service provider to assist with our assessment of the contractual and estimated cash flows. During subsequent evaluation periods, Valley uses a third party software application to assess the contractual and estimated cash flows. Using updated loan-level information derived from Valley&#8217;s main operating system, contractually required loan payments and expected cash flows for each pool level, the software reforecasts both the contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected. The loan-level information used to reforecast the cash flows is subsequently aggregated on a pool basis. The expected payment data, discount rates, impairment data and changes to the accretable yield are reviewed by Valley to determine whether this information is accurate and the resulting financial statement effects are reasonable. 

Similar to contractual cash flows, we reevaluate expected cash flows on a quarterly, or more frequent basis. Unlike contractual cash flows which are determined based on known factors, significant management assumptions are necessary in forecasting the estimated cash flows. We attempt to ensure the forecasted expectations are reasonable based on the information currently available; however, due to the uncertainties inherent in the use of estimates, actual cash flow results may differ from our forecast and the differences may be significant. To mitigate such differences, we carefully prepare and review the assumptions utilized in forecasting estimated cash flows. 

On a quarterly basis, Valley analyzes the actual cash flow versus the forecasts at the loan pool level and variances are reviewed to determine their cause. In re-forecasting future estimated cash flow, Valley will adjust the credit loss expectations for loan pools, as necessary. These adjustments are based, in part, on actual loss severities recognized for each loan type, as well as changes in the probability of default. For periods in which Valley does not reforecast estimated cash flows, the prior reporting period&#8217;s estimated cash flows are adjusted to reflect the actual cash received and credit events which transpired during the current reporting period. 

The following tables summarize the changes in the carrying amounts of PCI loans and the accretable yield on these loans for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 . &#160;

The net (decrease) increase in expected cash flows for certain pools of loans (included in the table above) is recognized prospectively as an adjustment to the yield over the estimated remaining life of the individual pools. The net decrease in the expected cash flows totaling approximately $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 was largely due to the high volume of contractual principal prepayments caused by the low level of market interest rates. The net increase in the expected cash flows totaling $269.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 was largely due to higher interest rates and increased construction loan balances (mainly acquired from USAB) captured in the cash flow reforecast in the fourth quarter 2018 . 

Non-performing Assets 

Non-performing assets (NPAs), which exclude non-performing PCI loans, include non-accrual loans, other real estate owned (OREO), other repossessed assets (which consist of automobiles) and non-accrual debt securities at December 31, 2019 . Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they become past due in excess of 90 days as to payment of principal or interest. Exceptions to the non-accrual policy may be permitted if the loan is sufficiently collateralized and in the process of collection. OREO is acquired through foreclosure on loans secured by land or real estate. OREO and other repossessed assets are reported at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell at the time of acquisition and at the lower of fair value, less estimated costs to sell, or cost thereafter. The non-performing assets totaling $104.4 million at December 31, 2019 increased 5.9 percent over the last 12-month period (as shown in the table below) primarily due to higher non-accrual commercial real estate loans. NPAs as a percentage of total loans and NPAs totaled 0.35 percent and 0.39 percent at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We believe our total NPAs has remained relatively low as a percentage of the total loan portfolio over the past five years. The moderate level of NPAs is reflective of our consistent approach to the loan underwriting criteria for both Valley originated loans and loans purchased from third parties. Past due loans and non-accrual loans in the table below exclude PCI loans. Under U.S. GAAP, the PCI loans (acquired at a discount that is due, in part, to credit quality) are accounted for on a pool basis and are not subject to delinquency classification in the same manner as loans originated by Valley. For details regarding performing and non-performing PCI loans, see the "Credit quality indicators" section in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

Loans past due 30 to 59 days decreased $5.2 million to $46.6 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $51.8 million at December 31, 2018 , mostly due to improved performance in all commercial loan delinquency categories, partially offset by increases in residential mortgage and consumer loan delinquencies. We do not believe that the higher level of residential mortgage and consumer loan delinquencies at December 31, 2019 represent any material negative trend within our total loan portfolio. All of the loans in this delinquency category are generally well secured and in the process of collection. 

Loans past due 60 to 89 days increased $6.2 million to $14.3 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018 partly due to two loan relationships totaling $3.7 million and $1.3 million within the commercial real estate and construction loan delinquencies, respectively, at December 31, 2019 . The construction loan relationship was in the normal matured loan in the process of renewal and was subsequently brought current to its contractual terms. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing decreased $494 thousand to $7.3 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018 . Commercial and industrial loan delinquencies decreased $2.2 million as compared to 2018 mainly due to one large loan relationship in the process of collection included in this category at December 31, 2018. All of the loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing are considered to be well secured and in the process of collection. 

Non-accrual loans increased $4.7 million to $93.1 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018 mainly due to an increase in commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a decrease in commercial and industrial loans. The $6.6 million increase in commercial real estate loans was partly due to a $3.9 million non-accrual loan at December 31, 2019 . This loan had no related reserves within the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 based upon the adequacy of the collateral valuation. The decrease in commercial and industrial loan category was mainly driven by non-accrual taxi medallion loans charge-offs totaling $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 . Non-accrual taxi medallion loans totaled $63.3 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $58.5 million at December 31, 2018 mainly due to continued weakness in the New York City taxi industry. The majority of the non-accrual taxi medallion loans were previously performing troubled debt restructured (TDR) loans and included in our impaired loans at both December 31, 2019 and 2018 . See further discussion of our taxi medallion loan portfolio below. 

Although the timing of collection is uncertain, management believes that most of the non-accrual loans at December 31, 2019 , are well secured and largely collectible based on, in part, our quarterly review of impaired loans and the valuation of the underlying collateral, if applicable. Our impaired loans (mainly consisting of non-accrual commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans over $250 thousand and all troubled debt restructured loans) totaled $163.6 million at December 31, 2019 and had $38.6 million in related specific reserves included in our total allowance for loan losses. If interest on non-accrual loans had been accrued in accordance with the original contractual terms, such interest income would have amounted to approximately $2.5 million , $3.6 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively; none of these amounts were included in interest income during these periods. 

During 2019 , we continued to closely monitor the performance of our New York City and Chicago taxi medallion loans totaling $107.5 million and $7.3 million, respectively, within the commercial and industrial loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 . While most of the taxi medallion loans are currently performing to their contractual terms, continued negative trends in the market valuations of the underlying taxi medallion collateral due to competing car service providers and other external factors could impact the future performance and internal classification of this portfolio. At December 31, 2019 , the medallion portfolio included impaired loans totaling $87.1 million with related reserves of $35.5 million within the allowance for loan losses as compared to impaired loans totaling $73.7 million with related reserves of $27.9 million at December 31, 2018 . At December 31, 2019 , the impaired medallion loans largely consisted of $63.3 million of non-accrual taxi cab medallion loans classified as doubtful, and $23.8 million performing TDR loans classified as substandard loans. 

Valley's historical taxi medallion lending criteria was conservative in regard to capping the loan amounts in relation to the prevailing market valuations at the time of origination, as well as obtaining personal guarantees and other collateral in certain instances. However, the severe decline in the market valuation of taxi medallions over the last several years has adversely affected the estimated fair valuation of these loans and, as a result, increased the level of our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 (See the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section below). Potential further declines in the market valuation of taxi medallions could also negatively impact the future performance of this portfolio. For example, a 25 percent decline in our current estimated market value of the taxi medallions would require additional allocated reserves of $11.8 million within the allowance for loan losses based upon the impaired taxi medallion loan balances at December 31, 2019 . 

OREO (which consisted of 30 commercial and residential properties) decreased to $9.4 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $9.5 million at December 31, 2018 . During 2019, we transferred 13 properties totaling $5.1 million and sold 35 properties for total proceeds of $6.6 million. The sales of OREO properties resulted in net gains of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to an immaterial net loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 .

Performing TDRs (i.e., TDRs not reported as loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing or as non-accrual loans) decreased $4.2 million to $73.0 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $77.2 million at December 31, 2018 mainly due to paydowns of several commercial and industrial loans during 2019 . Performing TDRs consisted of 120 loans and 119 loans (primarily in the commercial and industrial loan and commercial real estate portfolios) at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. On an aggregate basis, the $73.0 million in performing TDRs at December 31, 2019 had a modified weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.45 percent as compared to a pre-modification weighted average interest rate of 4.89 percent . See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures regarding our TDRs. The increase in the modified weighted average interest rate of the performing TDRs as compared to the pre-modification weighted average interest rate was largely due to loans restructured at higher interest rates due to the level of current market interest rates, but with extended loan terms and/or new contractual interest rates below market terms for similar credit risk profiles. 

Potential Problem Loans 

Although we believe that substantially all risk elements at December 31, 2019 have been disclosed in the categories presented above, it is possible that for a variety of reasons, including economic conditions, certain borrowers may be unable to comply with the contractual repayment terms on certain real estate and commercial loans. As part of the analysis of the loan portfolio, management determined that there were approximately $91.7 million and $142.8 million in potential problem loans (consisting mostly of commercial and industrial loans) at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Potential problem loans were not classified as non-accrual loans in the non-performing asset table above. Potential problem loans are defined as performing loans for which management has concerns about the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms and which may result in a non-performing loan. Our decision to include performing loans in potential problem loans does not necessarily mean that management expects losses to occur, but that management recognizes potential problem loans carry a higher probability of default. At December 31, 2019 , the potential problem loans consisted of various types of performing commercial credits internally risk rated substandard, including taxi medallion loans, because the loans exhibited well-defined weaknesses and required additional attention by management. See further discussion regarding our internal loan classification system at Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that Valley has identified all of its potential problem loans at December 31, 2019 . 

Asset Quality and Risk Elements 

Lending is one of the most important functions performed by Valley and, by its very nature, lending is also the most complicated, risky and profitable part of our business. For our commercial loan portfolio, comprised of commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and construction loans, a separate credit department is responsible for risk assessment and periodically evaluating overall creditworthiness of a borrower. Additionally, efforts are made to limit concentrations of credit so as to minimize the impact of a downturn in any one economic sector. We believe our loan portfolio is diversified as to type of borrower and loan. However, loans collateralized by real estate, including $5.9 billion of PCI loans, represent approximately 76 percent of total loans at December 31, 2019 . Most of the loans collateralized by real estate are in northern and central New Jersey, New York City and Florida presenting a geographical credit risk if there was a further significant broad-based deterioration in economic conditions within these regions (see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - "Our financial results and condition may be adversely impacted by changing economic conditions"). 

Consumer loans are comprised of residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, automobile loans and other consumer loans. Residential mortgage loans are secured by 1-4 family properties mostly located in New Jersey, New York and Florida. We do provide mortgage loans secured by homes beyond this primary geographic area; however, lending outside this primary area has generally consisted of loans made in support of existing customer relationships, as well as targeted purchases of certain loans guaranteed by third parties. Our mortgage loan originations are comprised of both jumbo (i.e., loans with balances above conventional conforming loan limits) and conventional loans based on underwriting standards that generally comply with Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac requirements. The weighted average loan-to-value ratio of all residential mortgage originations in 2019 was 72 percent while FICO &#174; (independent objective criteria measuring the creditworthiness of a borrower) scores averaged 751. Home equity and automobile loans are secured loans and are made based on an evaluation of the collateral and the borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness. In addition to our primary markets, automobile loans are mostly originated in several other contiguous states. Due to the level of our underwriting standards applied to all loans, management believes the out of market loans generally present no more risk than those made within the market. However, each loan or group of loans made outside of our primary markets poses different geographic risks based upon the economy of that particular region.

Management realizes that some degree of risk must be expected in the normal course of lending activities. Allowances are maintained to absorb such loan losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance for credit losses and related provision are an expression of management&#8217;s evaluation of the credit portfolio and economic climate. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded commercial letters of credit. Management maintains the allowance for credit losses at a level estimated to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and unfunded letter of credit commitments at the balance sheet dates, based on ongoing evaluations of the loan portfolio. Our methodology for evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses includes: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

segmentation of the loan portfolio based on the major loan categories, which consist of commercial, commercial real estate (including construction), residential mortgage and other consumer loans (including automobile and home equity loans); 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

tracking the historical levels of classified loans and delinquencies; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

assessing the nature and trend of loan charge-offs; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

providing specific reserves on impaired loans; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

evaluating the PCI loan pools for additional credit impairment subsequent to the acquisition dates. 

##TABLE_END Additionally, the qualitative factors, such as the volume of non-performing loans, concentration risks by size, type, and geography, new markets, collateral adequacy, credit policies and procedures, staffing, underwriting consistency, loan review and economic conditions are taken into consideration when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. 

The allowance for loan losses consists of four elements: (i) specific reserves for individually impaired credits, (ii) reserves for adversely classified, or higher risk rated, loans that are not impaired, (iii) reserves for other loans based on historical loss factors (using the appropriate loss look-back and loss emergence periods) adjusted for both internal and external qualitative risk factors to Valley, including the aforementioned factors, as well as changes in both organic and purchased loan portfolio volumes, the composition and concentrations of credit, new market initiatives, and the impact of competition on loan structuring and pricing, and (iv) an allowance for PCI loan pools impaired subsequent to the acquisition date, if applicable. 

The Credit Risk Management Department individually evaluates non-accrual (non-homogeneous) loans within the commercial and industrial loan and commercial real estate loan portfolio segments over $250 thousand and troubled debt restructured loans within all the loan portfolio segments for impairment based on the underlying anticipated method of payment consisting of either the expected future cash flows or the related collateral. If payment is expected solely based on the underlying collateral, an appraisal is completed to assess the fair value of the collateral. Collateral dependent impaired loan balances are written down to the current fair value (less estimated selling costs) of each loan&#8217;s underlying collateral resulting in an immediate charge-off to the allowance, excluding any consideration for personal guarantees that may be pursued in the Bank&#8217;s collection process. (See the &#8220;Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on Non-recurring Basis&#8221; section of Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further details). If repayment is based upon future expected cash flows, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s original effective interest rate is compared to the carrying value of the loan, and any shortfall is recorded as a specific valuation allowance in the allowance for credit losses. At December 31, 2019 , a $38.6 million specific valuation allowance was included in the allowance for credit losses related to $163.6 million of impaired loans that had such an allowance. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding impaired loans. 

The allowance allocations for non-classified loans within all of our loan portfolio segments are calculated by applying historical loss factors by specific loan types to the applicable outstanding loans and unfunded commitments. Loss factors are based on the Bank&#8217;s historical loss experience over a look-back period determined to provide the appropriate amount of data to accurately estimate expected losses as of period end. Additionally, management assesses the loss emergence period for the expected losses of each loan segment and adjusts each historical loss factor accordingly. The loss emergence period is the estimated time from the date of a loss event (such as a personal bankruptcy) to the actual recognition of the loss (typically via the first full or partial loan charge-off) and is determined based upon a study of our past loss experience by loan segment. The loss factors may also be adjusted for significant changes in the current loan portfolio quality that, in management&#8217;s judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date.

Our net loan charge-offs increased $15.3 million to $15.9 million in 2019 as compared to $658 thousand in 2018 mainly due to higher gross charge-offs in the commercial and industrial and consumer loan categories, as well as lower gross commercial and industrial loan recoveries during 2019. The higher level of commercial and industrial loan charge-offs in 2019 was mostly driven by taxi medallion loan partial charge-offs totaling $6.5 million and 5 other larger loan charge-offs totaling a combined $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 . 

Net charge-offs increased during 2019, but have remained relatively low over the last five years and within management's expectations for the credit quality of Valley's loan portfolio, its underwriting standards and the current economic environment. During this five-year period, our net charge-offs were at a high of 0.06 percent of average loans during 2019 and near zero during 2018. While we have a positive outlook for the future performance of the loan portfolio and the economy, there can be no assurance 

##TABLE_START 2019 Form 10-K 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

that our levels of net charge-offs will not deteriorate in 2020 , especially given the relatively low levels realized in the past five years. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $8.3 million to $24.2 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 largely due to continued improvements in the credit quality of the loan portfolio, including internally assigned risk ratings of commercial loans, higher impaired taxi medallion loans charge-offs and lower loan concentration risk in certain loan categories during 2019. Additionally, the decline in the provision in 2019 as compared to 2018 was partly due to a $1.6 million decrease in reserves for unfunded letters of credit (reported in the commercial and industrial loans category). 

The following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for credit losses to specific loan portfolio categories for the past five years:

* Includes the allowance for unfunded letters of credit. 

The allowance for credit losses, comprised of our allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded letters of credit, as a percentage of total loans was 0.55 percent at December 31, 2019 and 0.62 percent at December 31, 2018 . Our allowance allocations for losses at December 31, 2019 increased across most loan categories mainly due to strong organic loan growth. The increased allowance allocation for the commercial and industrial loans category (see table above) at December 31, 2019 was also partly due to higher specific reserves for impaired taxi medallion loans. At December 31, 2019 , the allowance allocation for commercial real estate loans declined to $20.0 million from $26.5 million at December 31, 2018 mainly due to a continued decline in historical loss rates over the prolonged current economic cycle. 

Our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total non-PCI loans (excluding PCI loans with carrying values totaling approximately $6.6 billion ) was 0.71 percent at December 31, 2019 as compared to 0.75 percent at December 31, 2018 . PCI loans, largely acquired through prior bank acquisitions, are accounted for on a pool basis and initially recorded net of fair valuation discounts related to credit which may be used to absorb future losses on such loans before any allowance for loan losses is recognized subsequent to acquisition. Due to the adequacy of such discounts, there were no allowance reserves related to PCI loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . See Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our allowance for loan losses. 

Loan Repurchase Contingencies 

We engage in the origination of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market. During 2016, loan sales increased significantly from 2015 as refinance activity once again strengthened due to a favorably low interest rate environment for most of the year. While refinance activity declined in 2017, Valley expanded its efforts in the purchased home loan market and expanded its team of home mortgage consultants. As a result of these efforts combined with portfolio loan sales, loan sales totaled approximately $934 million and $676 million for 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

In connection with loan sales, we make representations and warranties, which, if breached, may require us to repurchase such loans, substitute other loans or indemnify the purchasers of such loans for actual losses incurred due to such loans. However, 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

2019 Form 10-K 

##TABLE_END

the performance of our loans sold has been historically strong due to our strict underwriting standards and procedures. Over the past several years, we have experienced a nominal amount of repurchase requests, only a few of which have actually resulted in repurchases by Valley (only four loan repurchases in 2019 and five loan repurchase in 2018 ). None of the loan repurchases resulted in material loss. Accordingly, no reserves pertaining to loans sold were established on our consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . See Item 1A. Risk Factors - "We may incur future losses in connection with repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages that we have sold into the secondary market&#8221; of this Annual Report for additional information. 

Capital Adequacy 

A significant measure of the strength of a financial institution is its shareholders&#8217; equity. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , shareholders&#8217; equity totaled approximately $4.4 billion and $3.4 billion , or 11.7 percent and 10.5 percent of total assets, respectively. During 2019 , total shareholders&#8217; equity increased by $1.0 billion primarily due to (i) the additional capital of $835.3 million issued in the Oritani acquisition, (ii) net income of $309.8 million , (iii) $37.2 million of other comprehensive income, (iv) $15.9 million increase attributable to the effect of our stock incentive plan, and (v) a $3.0 million net cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings for the adoption of new accounting guidance as of January 1, 2019. These positive changes were partially offset by cash dividends declared on common and preferred stock totaling a combined $167.4 million . 

Valley and Valley National Bank are subject to the regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve Bank and the OCC. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Valley and Valley National Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of common equity Tier 1 capital, total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and Tier 1 capital to average assets, as defined in the regulations. 

We are required to maintain common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5 percent, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0 percent, ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0 percent, and minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 percent, plus a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer added to the minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , Valley and Valley National Bank exceeded all capital adequacy requirements. See Note 18 for Valley&#8217;s and Valley National Bank&#8217;s regulatory capital positions and capital ratios at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . 

Typically, our primary source of capital growth is through retention of earnings. Our rate of earnings retention is derived by dividing undistributed earnings per common share by earnings (or net income available to common stockholders) per common share. Our retention ratio was 49.4 percent and 41.3 percent for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Our retention ratio increased from the year ended December 31, 2018 mainly due to higher net interest income driven by strong loan growth and continued focus by management on our operational efficiency, partially offset by net charges from several infrequent items within our non-interest income and expense discussed elsewhere in this MD&#38;A. 

Cash dividends declared amounted to $0.44 per common share for both years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 . The Board is committed to examining and weighing relevant facts and considerations, including its commitment to shareholder value, each time it makes a cash dividend decision. The Federal Reserve has cautioned all bank holding companies about distributing dividends which may reduce the level of capital or not allow capital to grow considering the increased capital levels as required under the Basel III rules. Prior to the date of this filing, Valley has received no objection or adverse guidance from the FRB or the OCC regarding the current level of its quarterly common stock dividend. 

Valley maintains an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to periodically offer and sell in one or more offerings, individually or in any combination, our common stock, preferred stock and other non-equity securities. The shelf registration statement provides Valley with capital raising flexibility and enables Valley to promptly access the capital markets in order to pursue growth opportunities that may become available in the future and permits Valley to comply with any changes in the regulatory environment that call for increased capital requirements. Valley&#8217;s ability, and any decision to issue and sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement, is subject to market conditions and Valley&#8217;s capital needs at such time. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. Such offerings may be necessary in the future due to several reasons beyond management&#8217;s control, including numerous external factors that could negatively impact the strength of the U.S. economy or our ability to maintain or increase the level of our net income. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on Valley&#8217;s preferred stock issuances.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments. In the ordinary course of operations, Valley enters into various financial obligations, including contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. As a financial services provider, we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit, including loan commitments, standby and commercial letters of credit. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans made by the Bank. See Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

The following table summarizes Valley&#8217;s contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2019 . Payments for deposits, borrowings and debentures do not include interest. Payments related to leases, capital expenditures, other purchase obligations and commitments to sell loans are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts. Commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts; however, since many of these commitments are expected to expire unused or only partially used based upon our historical experience, the total amounts of these commitments do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. We principally manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities. We manage economic risks, including interest rate and liquidity risks, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our assets and liabilities and, from time to time, the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, we enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. Our derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash receipts and our known or expected cash payments mainly related to certain variable-rate borrowings and fixed-rate loan assets. Valley also enters into mortgage banking derivatives which are non-designated hedges. These derivatives include interest rate lock commitments provided to customers to fund certain residential mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of such loans. Valley enters into forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans when interest rate lock commitments are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of future changes in interest rates on Valley&#8217;s commitments to fund the loans, as well as on its portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale.
