 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis (MD&#38;A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following MD&#38;A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. The words "Valley," the "Company," "we," "our" and "us" refer to Valley National Bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless we indicate otherwise. Additionally, Valley&#8217;s principal subsidiary, Valley National Bank, is commonly referred to as the &#8220;Bank&#8221; in this MD&#38;A. 

The MD&#38;A contains supplemental financial information, described in the sections that follow, which has been determined by methods other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) that management uses in its analysis of our performance. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance, our business and performance trends and facilitate comparisons with the performance of others in the financial services industry. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may also be calculated differently from similar measures disclosed by other companies.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

At March 31, 2020 , we identified our policies on the allowance for credit losses, goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes to be critical accounting policies because management has to make subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. 

Determining the allowance for loan losses has historically been identified as a critical accounting estimate. On January 1, 2020, we adopted new accounting guidance which requires entities to estimate and recognize an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses for loans, unfunded credit commitments and held to maturity debt securities measured at amortized cost. Previously, an allowance for credit losses on loans was recognized based on probable incurred losses. See Notes 5, 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies and methodologies for establishing the allowance for credit losses. 

The accounting estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses remains a "critical accounting estimate" for the following reasons: 

&#8226; 

Changes in the provision for credit losses can materially affect our financial results; 

&#8226; 

Estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses require us to project future borrower performance, delinquencies and charge-offs, along with, when applicable, collateral values, based on a reasonable and supportable forecast period utilizing forward-looking economic scenarios in order to estimate probability of default and loss given default; 

&#8226; 

The allowance for credit losses is influenced by factors outside of our control such as industry and business trends, geopolitical events and the effects of laws and regulations as well as economic conditions such as trends in housing prices, interest rates, gross domestic product (GDP), inflation, energy prices and unemployment; and 

&#8226; 

Judgment is required to determine whether the models used to generate the allowance for credit losses produce an estimate that is sufficient to encompass the current view of lifetime expected credit losses. 

Our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties, including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance. Changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance and provision for credit losses. Accordingly, our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations. 

As discussed further in the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section in this MD&#38;A, we incorporated a multi-scenario economic forecast for estimating lifetime expected credit losses at March 31, 2020. As a result of the deterioration in economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during the first quarter of 2020 and the related increase in economic uncertainty, we increased our probability weighting for the most severe economic scenario. As a result, approximately 50 percent of the provision of credit losses for loans totaling $33.9 million for the first quarter 2020 reflected the impact of the adverse economic forecast within Valley's lifetime expected credit loss estimate. 

Details regarding our critical accounting policies for goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes are described in detail in Part II, Item 7 in Valley&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 . 

New Authoritative Accounting Guidance 

See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new authoritative accounting guidance, including the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition. 

Executive Summary 

Company Overview. At March 31, 2020 , Valley had consolidated total assets of approximately $39.1 billion , total net loans of $30.1 billion , total deposits of $29.0 billion and total shareholders&#8217; equity of $4.4 billion . Our commercial bank operations include branch office locations in northern and central New Jersey, the New York City Boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island, Florida and Alabama. Of our current 235 branch network, 59 percent , 16 percent , 18 percent and 7 percent of the branches are in New Jersey, New York, Florida and Alabama, respectively. Despite targeted branch consolidation activity, we have significantly grown both in asset size and locations over the past several years primarily through bank acquisitions, including our acquisition of Oritani Financial Corp. (Oritani) on December 1, 2019. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the Oritani acquisition. 

Impact of COVID-19. In March 2020, the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally, including the markets that we serve. Governmental responses to the pandemic have included orders closing businesses not deemed essential and directing individuals to restrict their movements, observe social distancing and shelter in place. These actions, together with responses to the pandemic by businesses and individuals, have resulted in rapid decreases in commercial and consumer activity, temporary closures of many businesses that have led to a loss of revenues and a rapid increase in unemployment, material decreases in oil and gas prices and in business valuations, disrupted global supply chains, market downturns and volatility, changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears, related emergency response legislation and an expectation that Federal Reserve policy will maintain a low interest rate environment for the foreseeable future. 

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law. It contains substantial tax and spending provisions intended to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a $349 billion program designed to aid small- and medium-sized businesses through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks. These loans are intended to guarantee eight weeks of payroll and other costs to help those businesses remain viable and allow their workers to pay their bills. Valley National Bank is a certified Small Business Administration (SBA) lender and has dedicated significant additional staff and other resources to help our customers complete and submit their applications and supporting documentation for loans offered under program, obtain SBA approval and receive funding as quickly as possible. During April 2020, Valley facilitated $1.6 billion of SBA assistance to its customers through this program's initial loan submission period ending on April 16, 2020. 

On April 24, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (Enhancement Act) was signed into law by President Donald Trump to address the continuing economic issues created by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Enhancement Act supplements the Paycheck Protection Program enacted on March 27, 2020, and provides additional funding of $321 billion for small-business loans, as well as other additional funding for health care providers and COVID-19 testing. As of May 6, 2020, Valley facilitated approximately $650 million of SBA assistance to its customers as part of this second round of program funding. 

In order to safeguard the health and wellness of our customers and employees, and to comply with applicable government directives, we have modified our business practices, including temporary closure of certain offices, restricting employee travel and directing employees to work remotely whenever possible. We also implemented our business continuity plans to the extent necessary. Over 90 percent of our non-branch employees are currently working remotely. We have temporarily closed 36 percent of our branches and all other branches offer only restricted drive-up service or lobby service by appointment. In an effort to support our employees through our extended benefits program, we paid $1.8 million in bonuses to our hourly employees; provided 80 hours of additional paid time for quarantine and sick time, as well as 24 additional hours for childcare arrangements; and will provide full coverage of COVID-related medical costs for covered employees and their families. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also entered into short-term loan modifications to provide temporary payment relief requested by certain qualifying borrowers. Generally, our forbearance agreements allow for a deferral of payments for 90 days, which we may extend for an additional 90 days, for a maximum of 180 days on a cumulative basis. As of March 31, 2020, we have granted temporary modifications on approximately 2,100 loans, resulting in an immaterial amount of deferred interest payments for the first quarter 2020. Through May 6, 2020, and including the deferred loans as of March 31, 2020, we have processed approximately 4,300 consumer payment deferral requests, including approximately 850 related to residential mortgage loans. In addition, Valley has processed payment deferral requests for approximately 1,250 mortgage loans serviced for others. From a commercial customer perspective, Valley has processed approximately 3,100 payment deferral requests. 

Significant uncertainties as to future economic conditions exist, and we have taken purposeful actions in response, including heightened levels of balance sheet liquidity as of March 31, 2020. Additionally, the economic pressures, coupled with the implementation of an expected loss methodology for determining our provision for credit losses as required by CECL have contributed to an increased provision for credit losses for the first quarter 2020. We continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 closely, as well as any effects that may result from the CARES Act, Enhancement Act and other government stimulus or Federal Reserve actions; however, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our operations and financial results during the remainder of 2020 is highly uncertain. 

Branch Transformation. As previously disclosed, Valley has embarked on a strategy to overhaul its retail network. Over one year ago, we established the foundation of what the transformation of our branch network would look like in coming years. At that time, we identified 74 branches that did not meet certain internal performance measures, including 20 branches that were closed and consolidated by the end of the first quarter 2019. For the remaining 54 branches, we implemented tailored action plans focused on improving profitability and deposit levels, as well as upgrades in staffing and training, within a defined timeline. During March 2020, we permanently closed an 

additional 3 branches located in New Jersey. We currently expect to permanently close 7 branches during the remainder of 2020. For the remaining branch network, we continue to monitor the operating performance of each branch and implement tailored action plans focused on improving profitability and deposit levels for those branches that underperform. At this time, we plan to reopen all branches temporarily closed due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Quarterly Results. Net income for the first quarter 2020 was $87.3 million , or $0.21 per diluted common share, compared to $113.3 million , or $0.33 per diluted common share, for the first quarter 2019 . The $26.1 million decrease in quarterly net income as compared to the same quarter one year ago was largely due to: (i) a $66.3 million decrease in non-interest income due to a $78.5 million gain on the sale (and leaseback) recognized during the first quarter 2019, (ii) a $26.7 million increase in our provision for credit losses for loans due to the CECL adoption and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the model results and (iii) a $7.9 million increase in non-interest expense, partially offset by (iv) a $46.7 million increase in net interest income caused by higher average loan balances driven by strong organic loan growth over the last 12 months and loans acquired from Oritani, and (v) a $28.1 million decrease in income tax expense largely due to lower pre-tax income. See the &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221;, &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221;, &#8220;Non-Interest Expense&#8221;, and &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; sections below for more details on the items above impacting our first quarter 2020 results, as well as other items discussed elsewhere in this MD&#38;A, for more details on the impact of the items above on our first quarter 2020 results. 

Operating Environment. During the first quarter 2020, real GDP contracted by 4.8 percent, as compared to an expansion of 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter 2019. The contraction was across many sectors of the U.S. economy as firms reduced their capital investments and pulled back from their other normal purchasing volumes due to business closures and interrupted supply chains. Additionally, households have been adversely impacted by sharply rising rates of layoffs and temporary furloughs and have also experienced severe restrictions on their movements outside their homes, due to state and local government emergency orders. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts that economic activity in the United States as measured by GDP will experience a sharp contraction of 12 percent in the second quarter of 2020, equivalent to an annual rate of decline of 40 percent for the quarter, with the unemployment rate rapidly rising to 14 percent in the second quarter. For fiscal year 2020, the CBO projects the federal budget deficit will be $3.7 trillion with federal debt held by the public projected to be 101 percent of GDP by the end of the fiscal year. Economic activity is expected by many to increase in the third quarter 2020, as concerns about the pandemic diminish and state and local governments ease stay-at-home orders, bans on public gatherings, and other measures restraining economic activity. However, significant challenges in the economy and the labor market are expected to persist for some time. 

Beginning in March 2020, the Federal Reserve announced several emergency actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On two separate occasions, the target range was reduced by 50 and 100 basis points at their March 3, 2020 and March 16, 2020 meetings, respectively. The target range for the federal funds rate is currently between zero and 0.25 percent. Additionally, the Federal Reserve initiated several programs to support the flow of credit to households and businesses to promote its employment and price stability goals. 

The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield ended the first quarter at 0.70 percent, 122 basis points lower compared with December 31, 2019. The spread between the 2- and 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields ended the first quarter 2020 at 0.47 percent, 13 basis points higher compared to the end of the fourth quarter 2019 and 33 basis points higher compared to March 31, 2019. 

&#160; 

For all commercial banks in the U.S., loans and leases grew approximately 4.9 percent in the first quarter 2020 compared to the previous quarter, largely resulting from balance sheet expansion at larger institutions. For the industry, banks reported increasing demand for commercial and industrial loan products to large and middle market firms compared to the previous quarter. Similarly, demand improved for most commercial real estate loans during the first quarter of 2020. Banks also reported less stringent credit standards for new loans, particularly for loans secured by multifamily residential structures. Valley&#8217;s originations increased across most loan categories driven by a strong fourth quarter 2019 pipeline and, in part, by a slight increase in utilization rates on commercial lines of credit. Demand for consumer loans, particularly, residential mortgage loans, was driven by high levels of refinance activity. The outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely impacted general business activity and consumer sentiment. As a 

result, demand for consumer loans is likely to wane in the second quarter, while an expected decline in new commercial loan activity will be supplemented by a high level of SBA PPP loan originations. However, many of the SBA loans are expected to be forgiven by the SBA and be repaid to Valley within a relatively short period. These factors may continue to challenge our business operations and results, as highlighted throughout the remaining MD&#38;A discussion below. 

Loans . Loans increased $728.9 million , or 9.8 percent on an annualized basis to approximately $30.4 billion at March 31, 2020 from December 31, 2019 . The increase was mainly due to continued strong quarter over quarter organic growth in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans, as well as stronger residential loan volumes during the first quarter 2020 . During the first quarter 2020 , we originated $148 million of residential mortgage loans for sale rather than held for investment and sold approximately $196 million of loans, including $30.0 million of pre-existing loans from our residential mortgage loan portfolio. Residential mortgage loans held for sale totaled $58.9 million and $76.1 million at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

See further details on our loan activities under the &#8220;Loan Portfolio&#8221; section below. 

Asset Quality. Prior to our adoption of the CECL standard on January 1, 2020, our past due loans and non-accrual loans discussed further below excluded loans that were formerly classified as Purchased Credit-Impaired (PCI) loans. Under previous U.S. GAAP, PCI loans (acquired at a discount that is due, in part, to credit quality) were accounted for on a pool basis and were not subject to delinquency classification in the same manner as loans originated by Valley. Under the new CECL standard, Valley's PCI loan pools are accounted for as Purchased Credit Deteriorated (PCD) loans on a loan level basis and, if applicable, reported in our past due and non-accrual loans at March 31, 2020 . 

Total non-performing assets (NPAs), consisting of non-accrual loans, other real estate owned (OREO), other repossessed assets and non-accrual debt securities increased $116.1 million to $220.5 million at March 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 largely due to an increase in non-accrual loans. Non-accrual loans increase d $112.9 million to $205.9 million at March 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 , largely due to non-accrual PCD loans totaling approximately $74.4 million which are required to be reported as delinquent loans under the CECL accounting guidance effective January 1, 2020. The remaining increase was largely due to additional taxi medallion loans within the commercial and industrial category. Non-accrual loans represented 0.68 percent of total loans at March 31, 2020 , as compared to 0.31 percent at December 31, 2019 . The increase in this percentage over the prior linked quarter is largely due to the $74.4 million of non-accrual PCD loans reported at March 31, 2020 . 

Total accruing past due loans (i.e., loans past due 30 days or more and still accruing interest) increased $91.2 million to $159.4 million , or 0.52 percent of total loans, at March 31, 2020 as compared to $68.2 million , or 0.23 percent of total loans, at December 31, 2019 largely due to an increase in early stage delinquencies in most loan categories. The increase was partly due to a few large commercial real estate loan delinquencies, an uptick in residential mortgage delinquencies and PCD loans past due totaling approximately $18.2 million at March 31, 2020 . 

Our lending strategy is based on underwriting standards designed to maintain high credit quality and we remain optimistic regarding the overall future performance of our loan portfolio. However, due to the potential for future credit deterioration caused by the recent downturn in economic conditions impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and a number of our borrowers performing under short-term forbearance agreements, management cannot provide assurance that our non-performing assets will not increase substantially from the levels reported as of March 31, 2020 . See the "Non-Performing Assets" section below for further analysis of our asset quality. 

Deposits and Other Borrowings . Our mix of the deposit categories of total average deposits for the first quarter 2020 remained relatively unchanged as compared to the fourth quarter 2019 , with a slight shift from time deposits to money market accounts. The higher money market balances were driven by increased depositor balances resulting from the uncertain financial markets, as well as a partial shift to more liquid funds for maturing retail CD customers. Average non-interest bearing deposits; savings, NOW and money market deposits; and time deposits represented approximately 23 percent , 45 percent and 31 percent of total deposits as of March 31, 2020 , 

respectively. Overall, average deposits increased by $2.0 billion to $28.8 billion for the first quarter 2020 as compared to the fourth quarter 2019 largely due to the $2.9 billion of assumed deposits in the Oritani acquisition on December 1, 2019. 

Actual ending balances for deposits decreased $168.8 million to approximately $29.0 billion at March 31, 2020 from December 31, 2019 largely due to a $1.2 billion decrease in time deposits. The decline in time deposits was mostly driven by an $825 million decrease in brokered CDs due to maturities during the first quarter and lower use of such deposits in our liquidity and loan funding management at March 31, 2020. These decreases were partially offset by increases in savings, NOW and money market deposits and non-interest bearing deposits of $741.3 million and $240.7 million at March 31, 2020 , respectively from December 31, 2019 . Total brokered deposits (consisting of both time and money market deposit accounts) were $3.4 billion at March 31, 2020 as compared to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2019 . 

Average short-term borrowings decreased $303.2 million to $1.3 billion for the first quarter 2020 as compared to the fourth quarter 2019 largely due to the maturity and repayment of short-term FHLB borrowings. Average long-term borrowings (including junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts which are presented separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition) increased by $397.4 million to $2.8 billion for the first quarter 2020 as compared to the fourth quarter 2019 . 

Actual ending balances for short-term borrowings and long-term borrowings increased by $1.0 billion and $683.2 million , to $2.1 billion and $2.8 billion , respectively at March 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 .The increase in both short- and long-term borrowings was primarily driven by our plan to increase our liquidity levels as an abundance of caution in the face of the escalating economic crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of March 31, 2020 , the short-term borrowings mainly consisted of FHLB advances totaling $1.5 billion with weighted interest rates well below 1.0 percent and federal funds purchased totaling $457 million with a weighted average rate of 0.17 percent. Of the $1.5 billion in FHLB advances, $600 million were hedged with cash flow interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategies during the first quarter 2020 . In addition, during the first quarter 2020 Valley obtained $723 million of new long-term FHLB advances with maturities between three and five years at a combined weighted average rate of approximately 1.89 percent.

In addition to the items used to calculate net income, as adjusted, in the tables above, our net income is, from time to time, impacted by fluctuations in the level of net gains on sales of loans and swap fees recognized from commercial loan customer transactions. These amounts can vary widely from period to period due to, among other factors, the amount of residential mortgage loans originated for sale, bulk loan portfolio sales and commercial loan customer demand for certain products. See the &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; section below for more details. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income consists of interest income and dividends earned on interest earning assets, less interest expense on interest bearing liabilities, and represents the main source of income for Valley. 

Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis totaling $266.4 million for the first quarter 2020 increased $46.5 million as compared to the first quarter 2019 and increased $26.8 million as compared to the fourth quarter 2019 . The increase as compared to the fourth quarter 2019 was largely due to higher average loan balances and lower costs of interest-bearing liabilities, partly offset by lower yielding loans. Interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased $20.0 million to $364.8 million for the first quarter 2020 as compared to the fourth quarter 2019 , mainly due to a $2.0 billion increase in average loans and higher loan discount accretion partially caused by repayments. Interest expense of $98.5 million for the first quarter 2020 decreased $6.8 million as compared to the fourth quarter 2019 , largely due to the overall lower cost of funds, partially offset by the interest cost associated with higher average balances of interest-bearing deposits and long-term borrowings. In December 2019, we prepaid $635.0 million of long-term FHLB advances with a combined weighted average interest rate of 3.93 percent. 

Average interest earning assets increased $5.1 billion to $34.7 billion for the first quarter 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 , primarily due to $3.8 billion of interest earning assets acquired from Oritani and strong organic loan growth over the last 12-month period. Compared to the fourth quarter 2019 , average interest earning assets increased by $2.3 billion from $32.3 billion due to the Oritani acquisition, continued organic loan growth during the first quarter 2020 and higher average overnight funds and investment securities partly driven by our planned increase in liquidity levels in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Average loans increased $2.0 billion to $30.0 billion for the first quarter 2020 from the fourth quarter 2019 mainly due to the Oritani acquisition and strong loan growth within the commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and residential loan portfolios. 

Average interest bearing liabilities increased $3.9 billion to $26.2 billion for the first quarter 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 mainly due to deposits and borrowings totaling a combined $3.4 billion assumed in the Oritani acquisition, organic growth retail deposits and additional borrowings caused by the funding of loan growth. Compared to the fourth quarter 2019 , average interest bearing liabilities increased by $2.0 billion in the first quarter 2020 primarily due to the deposits acquired from Oritani and our liquidity management strategies executed in the first quarter of 2020. See additional information under "Deposits and Other Borrowings" in the Executive Summary section above. 

Our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis of 3.07 percent for the first quarter 2020 increased by 9 basis points and 11 basis points from 2.98 percent and 2.96 percent for the first quarter 2019 and fourth quarter 2019 , respectively. The yield on average interest earning assets decreased by 6 basis points on a linked quarter basis mostly due to a decrease in the yield on loans. The yield on average loans decreased by 7 basis points to 4.44 percent for the first quarter 2020 as compared to the fourth quarter 2019 , largely due to the repayment of higher yielding loans, partly offset by a $7.7 million increase in loan discount accretion in the first quarter 2020 . The overall cost of average interest bearing liabilities decreased 24 basis points to 1.50 percent for the first quarter 2020 , as compared to the linked fourth quarter 2019 , due to both deposits and borrowings continuing to reprice at lower interest rates and the prepayment of the $635 million high cost FHLB advances in December 2019. Our cost of total average deposits was 1.07 percent for the first quarter 2020 as compared to 1.20 percent for the fourth quarter 2019 .

Income from trust and investment services increased $509 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 primarily due to increased fees related to higher levels of assets under management at Valley's asset management advisory subsidiary. 

Insurance commissions declined $574 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 mainly due to lower volumes of business generated by the Bank's insurance agency subsidiary. 

Our net gains on sales of loans for each period are comprised of both gains on sales of residential mortgages and the net change in the mark to market gains and losses on our loans originated for sale and carried at fair value at each period end. Net gains on sales of loans was relatively unchanged for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , as compared to the same period of 2019 , despite fewer loans sold in the first quarter 2020 . During the first quarter 2020 , we sold $196.1 million of residential mortgage loans, as compared to $293.1 million sold during the first quarter 2019 , including $30.0 million and $100.0 million of pre-existing residential mortgage loans sold from our loan portfolio for the respective periods. See further discussions of our residential mortgage loan origination activity under the &#8220;Loan Portfolio&#8221; section of this MD&#38;A below. 

Net gains on sales of assets decreased $77.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily due to a $78.5 million gain on the sale (and leaseback) of 26 locations recognized during the first quarter 2019. 

Bank owned life insurance income increased $1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 largely due to the death benefits received in the first quarter 2020 and income from bank owned life insurance acquired from Oritani during the fourth quarter of 2019. 

&#160; 

Other non-interest income increased $10.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 . The increase was primarily due to swap fee income related to derivative interest rate swaps executed with commercial loan customers totaling $14.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to $4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . 

Non-Interest Expense 

Non-interest expense increased $7.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019 . The following table presents the components of non-interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 :

Salary and employee benefits expense increased $2.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 . The increase was partly driven by a $1.8 million special bonus to hourly employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as additional salaries related to bank branch and other operational staff retained from the Oritani acquisition. These additional expenses were partially offset by cost reductions from our ongoing branch transformation efforts and other operational improvements over the last 12 months. 

Net occupancy and equipment expense increased $4.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 . This increase was primarily due to the net impact of additional costs in the current quarter associated with branches and other facilities acquired from Oritani, increased rental expenses due to the sale leaseback transaction completed in the first quarter 2019, partially offset by cost savings generated from branch closures over the last 12 months 

The FDIC insurance expense decreased $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 largely due to moderate expense accrual adjustments to the actual cash assessment payments in both periods. 

Amortization of other intangibles increased $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 due, in part, to $628 thousand of amortization expense from core deposit intangibles acquired in the recent Oritani acquisition and higher amortization expense on loan servicing rights. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more details. 

Professional and legal fees increased $816 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019 due to $444 thousand of integration costs related to the Oritani acquisition, as well as other incremental increases in consulting fees. 

Amortization of tax credit investments decreased $3.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019 . The first quarter of 2019 included a $2.4 million impairment charge related to investments in three federal renewable energy tax credit funds. The remainder of the variance from the prior period is due to normal differences in the timing and amount of such investments and recognition of the related tax credits. Tax credit investments, while negatively impacting the level of our operating expenses and efficiency ratio, produce tax credits that reduce our income tax expense and effective tax rate. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more details on our tax credit investments. 

Other non-interest expense increased $4.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 primarily due to incrementally higher operating expenses from a variety of categories including data processing, insurance, postage, miscellaneous supplies, and printing costs largely caused by the acquisition of Oritani, as well as the organic growth of our business. Additionally, advertising and OREO expenses increased $945 thousand and $404 thousand, respectively, during the first quarter 2020 as compared to the same period one year ago, and net gains on the sale of OREO properties declined by $725 thousand. 

Efficiency Ratio 

The efficiency ratio measures total non-interest expense as a percentage of net interest income plus total non-interest income. We believe this non-GAAP measure provides a meaningful comparison of our operational performance and facilitates investors&#8217; assessments of business performance and trends in comparison to our peers in the banking industry. Our overall efficiency ratio, and its comparability to some of our peers, is negatively impacted by the amortization of tax credit investments, as well as infrequent charges within non-interest income and expense. 

The following table presents our efficiency ratio and a reconciliation of the efficiency ratio adjusted for certain items during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 :

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense totaled $29.1 million for the first quarter 2020 as compared to $37.0 million and $57.2 million for the fourth quarter 2019 and first quarter 2019 , respectively. Our effective tax rate was 25.0 percent , 49.2 percent , and 33.5 percent for the first quarter 2020 , fourth quarter 2019 , and first quarter 2019 , respectively. The decline in the effective tax rate was mainly due to $18.7 million and $12.1million increases in the provision for income taxes related to uncertain tax liability positions during the fourth quarter 2019 and first quarter 2019 , respectively. 

The uncertain tax liability positions related to renewable energy tax credits and other tax benefits previously recognized from our investments in mobile generators sold and leased back by DC Solar and its affiliates. 

On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the CARES Act, which did not have a material impact on our reported income tax expense for the first quarter of 2020. 

U.S. GAAP requires that any change in judgment or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period be recognized as a discrete event in the quarter in which it occurs, rather than being recognized as a change in effective tax rate for the current year. Our adherence to these tax guidelines may result in volatile effective 

income tax rates in future quarterly and annual periods. Factors that could impact management&#8217;s judgment include changes in income, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning strategies. 

Business Segments 

We have four business segments that we monitor and report on to manage our business operations. These segments are consumer lending, commercial lending, investment management, and corporate and other adjustments. Our reportable segments have been determined based upon Valley&#8217;s internal structure of operations and lines of business. Each business segment is reviewed routinely for its asset growth, contribution to income before income taxes and return on average interest earning assets and impairment (if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount). Expenses related to the branch network, all other components of retail banking, along with the back office departments of our subsidiary bank are allocated from the corporate and other adjustments segment to each of the other three business segments. Interest expense and internal transfer expense (for general corporate expenses) are allocated to each business segment utilizing a &#8220;pool funding&#8221; methodology, which involves the allocation of uniform funding cost based on each segment's average earning assets outstanding for the period. The financial reporting for each segment contains allocations and reporting in line with our operations, which may not necessarily be comparable to any other financial institution. The accounting for each segment includes internal accounting policies designed to measure consistent and reasonable financial reporting and may result in income and expense measurements that differ from amounts under U.S. GAAP. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. 

The following tables present the financial data for each business segment for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 :

Consumer Lending 

This segment, representing approximately 24 percent of our loan portfolio at March 31, 2020 , is mainly comprised of residential mortgage loans and automobile loans, and to a lesser extent, home equity loans, secured personal lines of credit and other consumer loans (including credit card loans). The duration of the residential mortgage loan portfolio (which represented 14.6 percent of our loan portfolio at March 31, 2020 ) is subject to movements in the market level of interest rates and forecasted prepayment speeds. The weighted average life of the automobile loans (representing 4.7 percent of total loans at March 31, 2020 ) is relatively unaffected by movements in the market 

level of interest rates. However, the average life may be impacted by new loans as a result of the availability of credit within the automobile marketplace and consumer demand for purchasing new or used automobiles. The consumer lending segment also includes the Wealth Management and Insurance Services Division, comprised of trust, asset management, and insurance services. 

Average interest earning assets in this segment increased $396.1 million to $7.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 . The increase was largely due to approximately $255 million of loans acquired from Oritani, loan growth from residential mortgage loan originations over the last 12 month period, as well as solid demand for both automobile loans and collateralized personal lines of credit. 

Income before income taxes generated by the consumer lending segment decreased $2.8 million to $16.2 million for the first quarter 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 . Net interest income increased $3.1 million and was mainly driven by lower funding costs and the increase in average loans. The increase in net interest income was partially offset by increases of $1.2 million and $4.7 million in non-interest expense and provision for loan losses, respectively. The increase in the provision for loan losses for the first quarter 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 was mainly due to the impact of loan growth and the adverse economic forecast caused by COVID-19 included in our estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for this segment. See further details in the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section of this MD&#38;A. 

&#160; 

The net interest margin on the consumer lending portfolio increased 2 basis points to 2.69 percent for the first quarter 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 mainly due to a 23 basis point decrease in the costs associated with our funding sources, partially offset by a 21 basis point decrease in the yield on average loans. The decrease in our funding costs was mainly due to both deposits and borrowings continuing to reprice at lower interest rates and the prepayment of the $635 million high cost FHLB advances in December 2019. The 21 basis point decrease in loan yield was largely due to lower yielding new loan volumes. See the "Executive Summary" and the "Net Interest Income" sections above for more details on our net interest margin and funding sources. 

Commercial Lending 

The commercial lending segment is comprised of floating rate and adjustable rate commercial and industrial loans and construction loans, as well as fixed rate owner occupied and commercial real estate loans. Due to the portfolio&#8217;s interest rate characteristics, commercial lending is Valley&#8217;s business segment that is most sensitive to movements in market interest rates. Commercial and industrial loans totaled approximately $5.0 billion and represented 16.5 percent of the total loan portfolio at March 31, 2020 . Commercial real estate loans and construction loans totaled $18.1 billion and represented 59.5 percent of the total loan portfolio at March 31, 2020 . 

Average interest earning assets in this segment increased approximately $4.3 billion to $22.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 . The increase was mostly due to strong organic loan growth within the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loan portfolios over the last 12-month period and loans acquired from Oritani during the fourth quarter 2019. 

&#160; 

For the three months ended March 31, 2020 , income before income taxes for the commercial lending segment increased $20.3 million to $102.8 million as compared to the same quarter 2019 mainly due to increases in both net interest income and non-interest income. Net interest income increased $43.3 million to $202.7 million for the first quarter 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 largely due to higher average loan balances. Non-interest income increased $8.8 million to $15.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 mainly due to a $9.8 million increase in fee income related to derivative interest rate swaps executed with commercial loan customers. The positive impact of the aforementioned items was partially offset by a $21.2 million increase in the provision for credit losses mainly due to loan growth, higher specific reserves associated with our tax medallion loan portfolio and the adverse economic forecast for credit losses during the first quarter 2020. Internal transfer expense and non-interest expense also increase d $11.7 million for the first quarter 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 partly due to acquired and organic growth in our business since March 31, 2019. 

The net interest margin for this segment increased 10 basis points to 3.56 percent for the first quarter 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 largely due to a 23 basis point decrease in the cost of our funding sources, partially offset by a 13 basis point decrease in the yield on average loans. 

I nvestment Management 

The investment management segment generates a large portion of our income through investments in various types of securities and interest-bearing deposits with other banks. These investments are mainly comprised of fixed rate securities and, depending on our liquid cash position, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks (primarily the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) as part of our asset/liability management strategies. The fixed rate investments are one of Valley&#8217;s least sensitive assets to changes in market interest rates. However, a portion of the investment portfolio is invested in shorter-duration securities to maintain the overall asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. See the &#8220;Asset/Liability Management&#8221; section below for further analysis. 

Average interest earning assets in this segment increased $366.5 million during the first quarter 2020 as compared to the first quarter 2019 primarily due to a $302.9 million increase in average interest bearing deposits and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the investment securities portfolio. The increase in average interest bearing deposits was caused by the timing of loan and investment activity, as well as our prudent increase in our liquidity levels during first quarter 2020 . 

For the quarter ended March 31, 2020 , income before income taxes for the investment management segment decreased $912 thousand to $7.8 million as compared to the first quarter 2019 due, in part, to a $759 thousand provision for credit losses for debt securities classified as held to maturity under the new CECL standard adopted in the first quarter 2020 . 

The net interest margin for this segment decreased 13 basis points to 1.63 percent for the first quarter 2020 as compared to the same quarter 2019 largely due to a 36 basis point decrease in the yield on average investments, partially offset by a 23 basis point decrease in costs associated with our funding sources. The decrease in the yield on average investments as compared to the first quarter 2019 was mainly due to repayment and prepayment of higher yield residential mortgage-backed securities, increased premium amortization and lower yielding new investments purchased over the last 12 months. 

Corporate and other adjustments 

The amounts disclosed as &#8220;corporate and other adjustments&#8221; represent income and expense items not directly attributable to a specific segment, including net securities gains and losses not reported in the investment management segment above, interest expense related to subordinated notes, amortization and impairment of tax credit investments, as well as non-core items, including merger expenses and the gain on the sale leaseback transactions. 

The corporate segment recognized a $10.5 million pre-tax loss and a $60.2 million pre-tax gain for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The decline in pre-tax income was mainly due to a $78.5 million gain on the sale (and leaseback) of 26 locations recognized in non-interest income for the first quarter 2019. However, internal transfer income increased $13.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 from the first quarter 2019 . See further details in the "Non-Interest Income" and "Non-Interest Expense" sections of this MD&#38;A. 

ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT 

Interest Rate Sensitivity 

Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk. Interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to the movement in interest rates. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for managing such risks and establishing policies that monitor and coordinate our sources and uses of funds. Asset/Liability management is a continuous process due to the constant change in interest rate risk factors. In assessing the appropriate interest rate risk levels for us, management weighs the potential benefit of each risk management activity within the desired parameters of liquidity, capital levels and management&#8217;s tolerance for exposure to income fluctuations. Many of the actions undertaken by management utilize fair value analysis and attempt to achieve consistent accounting and economic benefits for financial assets and their related funding sources. We have predominantly focused on managing our interest rate risk by attempting to match the inherent risk and cash flows of financial assets and liabilities. Specifically, management employs multiple risk management activities such as optimizing the level of new residential mortgage originations retained in our mortgage portfolio through increasing or decreasing loan sales in the secondary market, product pricing levels, the desired maturity levels for new originations, the composition levels of both our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, as well as several other risk management activities. 

We use a simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates. The simulation model projects net interest income based on various interest rate scenarios over a 12-month and 24-month period. The model is based on the actual maturity and re-pricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities. The model incorporates certain assumptions which management believes to be reasonable regarding the impact of changing interest rates and the prepayment assumptions of certain assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2020 . The model assumes immediate changes in interest rates without any proactive change in the composition or size of the balance sheet, or other future actions that management might undertake to mitigate this risk. In the model, the forecasted shape of the yield curve remains static as of March 31, 2020 . The impact of interest rate derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, is also included in the model. 

Our simulation model is based on market interest rates and prepayment speeds prevalent in the market as of March 31, 2020 . Although the size of Valley&#8217;s balance sheet is forecasted to remain static as of March 31, 2020 in our model, the composition is adjusted to reflect new interest earning assets and funding originations coupled with rate spreads utilizing our actual originations during the first quarter 2020 . The model also utilizes an immediate parallel shift in market interest rates at March 31, 2020 . 

The assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the table below due to the frequency and timing of changes in interest rates and changes in spreads between maturity and re-pricing categories. Overall, our net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and cash flows from our loan and investment portfolios. We actively manage these cash flows in conjunction with our liability mix, duration and interest rates to optimize the net interest income, while structuring the balance sheet in response to actual or potential changes in interest rates. Additionally, our net interest income is impacted by the level of competition within our marketplace. Competition can negatively impact the level of interest rates attainable on loans and increase the cost of deposits, which may result in downward pressure on our net interest margin in future periods. Other factors, including, but not limited to, the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows will impact our net interest income results and may increase or decrease the level of asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. 

Convexity is a measure of how the duration of a financial instrument changes as market interest rates change. Potential movements in the convexity of bonds held in our investment portfolio, as well as the duration of the loan portfolio may have a positive or negative impact on our net interest income in varying interest rate environments. As a result, the increase or decrease in forecasted net interest income may not have a linear relationship to the results reflected in the table below. Management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income. 

The following table reflects management&#8217;s expectations of the change in our net interest income over the next 12- month period in light of the aforementioned assumptions. While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this simulation model, we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact than shown in the table below.

As noted in the table above, a 100 basis point immediate decrease in interest rates combined with a static balance 

sheet where the size, mix, and proportions of assets and liabilities remain unchanged is projected to decrease net interest income over the next 12 months by 5.30 percent . Valley's sensitivity to changes in market rates increased as compared to December 31, 2019 (which projected an increase of 3.19 percent in net interest income over a 12 month period) mostly due to the significant changes interest rate environment and the term structure of rates and with some effect from variations in balance sheet composition. Management believes the interest rate sensitivity remains within an acceptable tolerance range at March 31, 2020 . However, the level of net interest income sensitivity may increase or decrease in the future as a result of changes in deposit and borrowings strategies, the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows. 

Liquidity 

Bank Liquidity 

Liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due. A bank&#8217;s liquidity reflects its ability to meet loan demand, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate opportunities in the marketplace. Liquidity management is carefully performed and reported by our Treasury Department to two Board committees. Among other actions, Treasury reviews historical funding requirements, current liquidity position, sources and stability of funding, marketability of assets, options for attracting additional funds, and anticipated future funding needs, including the level of unfunded commitments. Our goal is to maintain sufficient liquidity to cover current and potential funding requirements. 

The Bank has no required regulatory liquidity ratios to maintain; however, it adheres to an internal liquidity policy. The current policy maintains that we may not have a ratio of loans to deposits in excess of 125 percent or reliance on wholesale funding greater than 25 percent of total funding. The Bank was in compliance with the foregoing policies at March 31, 2020 . 

&#160; 

During mid-March 2020, Valley activated its Contingent Funding Plan (CFP), including governing oversight by establishing the Liquidity Crisis Committee (LCC), in response to the financial and public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The LCC continues to meet frequently to assess the financial impacts of the significant business disruption caused by COVID-19, closely monitor events which may disrupt financial markets and make decisions about accessing various sources of liquidity as part of Valley's overall liquidity management strategy. The LCC executed a plan to increase the Bank's liquidity by approximately $1.7 billion through various new short- and long-term borrowings during the first quarter 2020 which continued into the early stages of the second quarter. See the "Deposits and Other Borrowings" section and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. 

On the asset side of the balance sheet, the Bank has numerous sources of liquid funds in the form of cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks (including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York), investment 

securities held to maturity that are maturing within 90 days or would otherwise qualify as maturities if sold (i.e., 85 percent of original cost basis has been repaid), investment securities available for sale, loans held for sale, and from time to time, federal funds sold and receivables related to unsettled securities transactions. Total liquid assets were approximately $2.9 billion , representing 8.2 percent of earning assets at March 31, 2020 and $2.2 billion , representing 6.4 percent of earning assets at December 31, 2019 . Of the $2.9 billion of liquid assets at March 31, 2020 , approximately $1.0 billion of various investment securities were pledged to counterparties to support our earning asset funding strategies. We anticipate the receipt of approximately $1.6 billion in principal payments from securities in the total investment portfolio over the next 12 months due to normally scheduled principal repayments and expected prepayments of certain securities, primarily residential mortgage-backed securities. 

Additional liquidity is derived from scheduled loan payments of principal and interest, as well as prepayments received. Loan principal payments (including loans held for sale at March 31, 2020 ) are projected in accordance with their scheduled contractual terms to be approximately $7.6 billion over the next 12 months. As a contingency plan for any liquidity constraints, liquidity could also be derived from the sale of conforming residential mortgages from our loan portfolio or alleviated from the temporary curtailment of lending activities. 

On the liability side of the balance sheet, we utilize multiple sources of funds to meet liquidity needs, including retail and commercial deposits, brokered and municipal deposits, and short-term and long-term borrowings. Our core deposit base, which generally excludes fully insured brokered deposits and both retail and brokered certificates of deposit over $250 thousand, represents the largest of these sources. Average core deposits totaled approximately $23.9 billion and $20.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2019 , respectively, representing 68.8 percent and 66.8 percent of average earning assets for the respective periods. The level of interest bearing deposits is affected by interest rates offered, which is often influenced by our need for funds and the need to match the maturities of assets and liabilities. 

Additional funding may be provided through deposit gathering networks and in the form of federal funds purchased through our well established relationships with numerous correspondent banks. While there are no firm lending commitments currently in place, management believes that we could borrow approximately $1.1 billion for a short term from these banks on a collective basis. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (FHLB) and has the ability to borrow from them in the form of FHLB advances secured by pledges of certain eligible collateral, including but not limited to U.S. government and agency mortgage-backed securities and a blanket assignment of qualifying first lien mortgage loans, consisting of both residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans. Furthermore, we can obtain overnight borrowings from the FRB via the discount window as a contingency for additional liquidity. At March 31, 2020 , our borrowing capacity under the Federal Reserve's discount window was $1.8 billion . 

We also have access to other short-term and long-term borrowing sources to support our asset base, such as repos (i.e., securities sold under agreements to repurchase). Short-term borrowings (consisting of FHLB advances, repos, and from time to time, federal funds purchased) increased approximately $1.0 billion to $2.1 billion at March 31, 2020 , as compared to December 31, 2019 . The increase in both short-term and long-term borrowings was primarily driven by our CFP goal to increase our liquidity levels. As of March 31, 2020, the short-term borrowings mainly consisted of FHLB advances totaling $1.5 billion, with weighted interest rates well below 1.0 percent and federal funds purchased totaling $457 million. In addition, we obtained $723 million of new long-term FHLB advances with maturities between three and five years at a combined weighted average rate of 1.89 during the first quarter 2020. 

Average short-term FHLB advances exceeded 30 percent of total shareholders' equity at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. The following table sets forth information regarding Valley&#8217;s short-term FHLB advances at the dates and for the periods ended March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 :

Corporation Liquidity 

Valley&#8217;s recurring cash requirements primarily consist of dividends to preferred and common shareholders and interest expense on subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts. As part of our on-going asset/liability management strategies, Valley could also use cash to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock under its share repurchase program or redeem its callable junior subordinated debentures. These cash needs are routinely satisfied by dividends collected from the Bank. Projected cash flows from the Bank are expected to be adequate to pay preferred and common dividends, if declared, and interest expense payable to subordinated note holders and capital trusts, given the current capital levels and current profitable operations of the Bank. In addition to dividends received from the Bank, Valley can satisfy its cash requirements by utilizing its own cash and potential new funds borrowed from outside sources or capital issuances. Valley also has the right to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures, and therefore distributions on its trust preferred securities for consecutive quarterly periods up to five years, but not beyond the stated maturity dates, and subject to other conditions. 

Valley's ability to maintain quarterly dividends to its preferred and common shareholders is heavily dependent on the ability of its principal subsidiary, the Bank, to pay dividends to Valley. However, we cannot predict the extent of the economic decline due to COVID-19 or other factors that may result in inadequate earnings (primarily by the Bank), regulatory restrictions and limitations, changes in our capital requirements, or a decision to increase capital by retention of earnings, that may result in Valley's inability or determination by its Board not to pay dividends at current levels, or at all. 

Investment Securities Portfolios 

As of March 31, 2020 , we had $49.7 million , $1.7 billion and $2.3 billion in equities, available for sale debt securities and held to maturity debt securities, respectively. Our equity securities portfolio was comprised of a money market mutual fund and, to a lesser extent, investments in public and private Community Reinvestment Act funds. Our held to maturity and available for sale debt securities portfolios were comprised of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, tax-exempt and taxable issuances of states and political subdivisions (including special revenue bonds), residential mortgage-backed securities, single-issuer trust preferred securities principally issued by bank holding companies, and high quality corporate bonds issued by banks at March 31, 2020 . There were no securities in the name of any one issuer exceeding 10 percent of shareholders&#8217; equity, except for residential mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae and Fannie Mae. Additionally, certain securities with limited marketability and/or restrictions, such as FHLB and FRB stocks, are carried at cost and are included in other assets. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Allowance for Credit Losses and Impairment Analysis 

Effective January 1, 2020, Valley adopted ASU No. 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments", which requires an estimate of lifetime expected credit 

losses for held to maturity debt securities established as an allowance for credit losses and replaces the other-than-temporarily impaired model for available for sale debt securities. 

Available for sale debt securities. The new guidance in ASC Topic 326-30 requires credit losses to be presented as an allowance, rather than as a write-down if management does not intend to sell an available for sale debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Available for sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses at least quarterly. In assessing whether a credit loss exists, we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited to the amount the fair value is less than amortized cost basis. Declines in fair value that have not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses, such as declines due to changes in market interest rates, are recorded through other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. 

We have evaluated all available for sale debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2020 included in the table below and determined that the declines in fair value are mainly attributable to changes in market volatility, due to factors such as interest rates and spread factors, but not attributable to credit quality or other factors. Based on a comparison of the present value of expected cash flows to the amortized cost, management recognized no impairment during the first quarter 2020 and, as a result, no allowance for credit losses for available for sale debt securities at March 31, 2020 . 

&#160; 

Held to maturity debt securities. As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, Valley has a zero loss expectation for certain securities within the held to maturity portfolio, including, U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, residential mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and collateralized municipal bonds. To measure the expected credit losses on held to maturity debt securities that have loss expectations, Valley estimates the expected credit losses using a discounted cash flow model developed by a third party. Assumptions used in the model for pools of securities with common risk characteristics include the historical lifetime probability of default and severity of loss in the event of default, with the model incorporating several economic cycles of loss history data to calculate expected credit losses given default at the individual security level. At March 31, 2020, held to maturity debt securities were carried net of allowance for credit losses totaling $1.6 million. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our allowance for credit losses for held to maturity securities. 

The investment grades in the table below reflect the most current independent analysis performed by third parties of each security as of the date presented and not necessarily the investment grades at the date of our purchase of the securities. For many securities, the rating agencies may not have performed an independent analysis of the tranches owned by us, but rather an analysis of the entire investment pool. For this and other reasons, we believe the assigned investment grades may not accurately reflect the actual credit quality of each security and should not be viewed in isolation as a measure of the quality of our investment portfolio.

Includes net unearned discount and deferred loan fees of $76.4 million at March 31, 2020 and unearned premiums and deferred loan fees of $12.6 million , $18.3 million , $19.6 million and $20.5 million at March 31, 2020 , December 31, 2019 , September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. Net unearned discounts and deferred loan fees at March 31, 2020 include the non-credit discount on PCD loans. 

Loans increased $728.9 million to approximately $30.4 billion at March 31, 2020 from December 31, 2019 . The increase was mainly due to continued strong quarter over quarter organic growth in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans, as well as stronger residential loan volumes during the first quarter 2020 . During the first quarter 2020 , we originated $148 million of residential mortgage loans for sale (rather than held for investment) and sold approximately $196 million , including $30 million of pre-existing loans from our residential mortgage loan portfolio. Residential mortgage loans held for sale totaled $58.9 million and $76.1 million at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. Additionally, upon our adoption of the CECL standard on January 1, 2020, we recorded a $61.6 million gross-up for PCD loans that increased the amortized cost basis of loans with a corresponding increase to the allowance for credit losses. 

Total commercial and industrial loans increased $172.7 million , or 14.3 percent on an annualized basis, from December 31, 2019 to approximately $5.0 billion at March 31, 2020 . Excluding the $25.5 million related to the CECL adoption gross-up, the increase was mostly driven by draws of revolving lines from existing relationships due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic and market conditions; and to a lesser extent, by new small to middle market lending relationships within our markets. In addition, our premium finance division grew $28.5 million from December 31, 2019 . 

Commercial real estate loans (excluding construction loans) increased $393.5 million , or 9.8 percent on an annualized basis to $16.4 billion at March 31, 2020 from December 31, 2019 . Excluding the $27.4 million related to the CECL adoption gross-up, the increase was mainly due to continued strong loan volumes in our primary markets in Florida, New Jersey and New York and some migration of completed construction projects to permanent 

financing. During the first quarter 2020, we have experienced an active refinance market which is driven by a favorable interest rate market resulting in steady and controlled growth throughout our footprint. Construction loans increased $80.0 million to $1.7 billion at March 31, 2020 from December 31, 2019 mainly driven by loan advances on new and existing construction projects during the first quarter 2020 . 

Total residential mortgage loans increased $101.9 million to approximately $4.5 billion at March 31, 2020 from December 31, 2019 , largely driven by high levels of refinance activity. The loan growth was partially offset by the sale of $196 million loans, including $30 million of pre-existing loans from our residential mortgage loan portfolio during the first quarter 2020 . New and refinanced residential mortgage loan originations totaled approximately $358.9 million for the first quarter 2020 , as compared to $504.6 million and $254.1 million for the fourth quarter 2019 and first quarter 2019 , respectively. 

Home equity loans totaled $481.8 million at March 31, 2020 , a decrease of $5.5 million from December 31, 2019 , largely due to normal repayments that outpaced new loan origination activity. 

Automobile loans decreased by $14.9 million to $1.4 billion at March 31, 2020 , as compared to December 31, 2019 . The first quarter annualized decline was 4.1 percent , due to lower application volumes as compared to the fourth quarter 2019 . The decrease was largely due to tightening our underwriting standards and COVID-19 impact. During the second half of March 2020, auto dealerships in our primary market areas were shut down as a result of shelter-in-place restrictions in connection with the pandemic. Our Florida dealership network contributed $28.3 million in auto loan originations, representing approximately 21 percent of Valley's total new auto loan production during the first quarter 2020 , as compared to $40.8 million, representing approximately 24 percent during the fourth quarter 2019 . 

Other consumer loans increased $1.1 million to $914.6 million at March 31, 2020 , as compared to $913.4 million at December 31, 2019 , mostly due to higher volumes of new collateralized personal lines of credit as compared to the fourth quarter 2019 . 

Most of our lending is in northern and central New Jersey, New York City, Long Island and Florida, except for smaller auto and residential mortgage loan portfolios derived from other neighboring states of New Jersey, which could present a geographic and credit risk due to the recent economic downturn within these regions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertain path forward to restart the U.S. economy. To mitigate our geographic risks, we make efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio as to type of borrower and loan, to guard against a potential downward turn in any one economic sector. 

In the early stage of the second quarter of 2020, COVID-related economic shutdowns in our markets have slowed both new originations and unexpected paydowns. As traditional origination activity has slowed we have diverted resources to managing the demands of the PPP. We received approximately 13,000 loan requests and originated 5,100 loans totaling $1.6 billion under the first phase of the program. Our expectation is that a large amount, between 80% and 85% of loans made under this program will be either fully or partially forgiven and are expected to come off our balance sheet in the near-term. 

Non-performing Assets 

Prior to our adoption of the CECL standard on January 1, 2020, our past due loans and non-accrual loans discussed further below excluded those loans which were classified as Purchased Credit-Impaired (PCI) loans. Under previous U.S. GAAP, the PCI loans (acquired at a discount that is due, in part, to credit quality) were accounted for on a pool basis and not subject to delinquency classification in the same manner as loans originated by Valley. Under the new CECL standard, Valley's former PCI loan pools are accounted for as purchased credit deteriorated (PCD) loans on a loan level basis and, if applicable, are reported in our past due and non-accrual loans at March 31, 2020 . 

Non-performing assets include non-accrual loans, other real estate owned (OREO), other repossessed assets (which primarily consists of automobiles and taxi medallions) and non-accrual debt securities at March 31, 2020 . Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they become past due in excess of 90 days as to payment of principal or interest. Exceptions to the non-accrual policy may be permitted if the loan is sufficiently collateralized and in the process of collection. OREO is acquired through foreclosure on loans secured by land or real estate. OREO and other repossessed assets are reported at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell at the time of acquisition and at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs to sell, thereafter. Our non-performing assets increased $116.1 million to $220.5 million at March 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 , largely due to non-accrual PCD loans totaling approximately $74.4 million added to this category under CECL during the first quarter 2020, as well as additional non-accrual taxi medallion loans within the commercial and industrial loan portfolio. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans and non-performing assets totaled 0.72 percent and 0.35 percent at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively (as shown in the table below). For additional details, see the "Credit quality indicators" section in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

Past due loans and non-accrual loans presented in periods prior to March 31, 2020 exclude PCI loans. PCI loans were accounted for on a pool basis and are were not subject to delinquency classification. 

&#160; 

Loans past due 30 to 59 days increased $70.4 million to $117.0 million at March 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 . The increase was mostly due to higher commercial real estate delinquencies driven by a few large loans totaling approximately $30 million included in this category at March 31, 2020 . In addition, loans past due 30 to 59 days included matured performing commercial real estate and construction loans that were in the normal process of 

renewal totaling $4.3 million and $5.0 million at March 31, 2020 , respectively. Within the same delinquency category, residential mortgage loans included PCD loans totaling approximately $10.0 million at March 31, 2020 . 

Loans past due 60 to 89 days increased $20.9 million to $35.3 million at March 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 mainly due to several large commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans totaling $13.8 million and $4.5 million, respectively, included in this delinquency category. The residential mortgage category included $3.3 million of PCD delinquencies at March 31, 2020 . 

Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest decreased $218 thousand to $7.1 million at March 31, 2020 as compared to $7.3 million at December 31, 2019 . All of the loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing are considered to be well secured and in the process of collection. 

Non-accrual loans increased $112.9 million to $205.9 million at March 31, 2020 as compared to $93.1 million at December 31, 2019 largely due to non-accrual PCD loans totaling approximately $74.4 million and the reclassification of approximately $37 million of previously accruing taxi medallion loans to non-accrual status during the first quarter of 2020. 

Valley has worked with borrowers impacted by COVID-19 by providing loan modifications, and as of May 6, 2020 had approximately 7,400 consumers and commercial borrowers with loans in forbearance. Valley will continue to work with customers seeking flexibility on loan terms and conditions due to the pandemic in accordance with prudent banking principles and bank regulatory guidance. In addition, Valley was proactive in securing financing through the SBA PPP for its small business customers. 

Valley has identified certain borrower industries as being potentially exposed to the effects of economic shutdowns related to COVID-19. These industries include doctor and surgery centers, retail trade, hotels and hospitality, restaurants and food service, and entertainment and recreation. As of March 31, 2020, Valley had outstanding loans of approximately $2.2 billion to borrowers in these industries representing approximately 7 percent of total outstanding loans. Industries that may have secondary exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic include nursing and residential care, wholesale trade, manufacturing, and child care and education. As of March 31, 2020, Valley had outstanding loans of approximately $2.4 billion to borrowers in these industries representing approximately 8 percent of total outstanding loans. The large majority of loans to the aforementioned industries were pass-rated under Valley&#8217;s internal risk rating system as of March 31, 2020. As of May 6, 2020, Valley had loans in forbearance representing approximately 17 percent of our loans in the aforementioned industries. 

During the first quarter 2020 , we continued to closely monitor our New York City and Chicago taxi medallion loans totaling $102.8 million and $7.0 million, respectively, within the commercial and industrial loan portfolio at March 31, 2020 . Due to continued negative trends in market valuations of the underlying taxi medallion collateral, a weak operating environment and uncertain borrower performance, the remainder of our previously accruing taxi medallion loans were placed on non-accrual status during the first quarter 2020 . At March 31, 2020 , non-accrual taxi medallion loans totaling $109.8 million had related reserves of $56.8 million within the allowance for loan losses. 

Valley's historical taxi medallion lending criteria had been conservative regarding capping the loan amounts in relation to market valuations, as well as obtaining personal guarantees and other collateral in certain instances. However, the severe decline in the market valuation of taxi medallions has adversely affected the estimated fair valuation of these loans and, as a result, increased the level of our allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2020 (See the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section below). Potential further declines in the market valuation of taxi medallions could also negatively impact the future performance of this portfolio. For example, a 25 percent decline in our current estimated market value of the taxi medallions would require additional allocated reserves of $17.3 million within the allowance for loan losses based upon the impaired taxi medallion loan balances at March 31, 2020 . 

OREO properties increased $784 thousand to $10.2 million at March 31, 2020 from $9.4 million at December 31, 2019 . Sales of OREO properties resulted in net gains of $157 thousand and $881 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , respectively. The residential mortgage and consumer loans secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process totaled $1.8 million at March 31, 2020 . 

Other repossessed assets increased $2.6 million to $3.8 million at March 31, 2020 from December 31, 2019 mainly due to the repossession of 14 taxi medallions from our non-performing taxi medallion portfolio during the first quarter 2020. See the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section below for information on charge-offs related to taxi medallion loans, including those resulting from repossessions during the first quarter 2020. 

TDRs represent loan modifications for customers experiencing financial difficulties where a concession has been granted. Performing TDRs (i.e., TDRs not reported as loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing or as non-accrual loans) decreased $25.0 million to $48.0 million at March 31, 2020 as compared to $73.0 million at December 31, 2019 . Performing TDRs consisted of 85 loans at March 31, 2020 . On an aggregate basis, the $48.0 million in performing TDRs at March 31, 2020 had a modified weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.93 percent as compared to a pre-modification weighted average interest rate of 4.84 percent . 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact on certain customers, Valley implemented short-term loan modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or delays in payment that are insignificant, when requested by customers. These modifications complied with the CARES Act to provide temporary payment relief to those borrowers directly impacted by COVID-19 who were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. Generally, the modification terms allow for a deferral of payments for 90 days, which we may extend for an additional 90 days, for a maximum of 180 days on a cumulative and successive basis. As of March 31, 2020, Valley granted temporary modifications on approximately 2,100 loans, resulting in an immaterial amount of deferred interest payments. Under the applicable guidance, none of these loans were considered TDRs as of March 31, 2020. 

Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans 

The allowance for credit losses for loans consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted the new CECL standard, which is based on lifetime expected credit losses rather than incurred losses. Valley recorded a $99.6 million increase to its allowance for credit losses for loans, including reserves of $61.6 million related to PCD loans. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the Day 1 CECL adoption. 

Our methodology to establish the allowance for loan losses has two basic components: (1) a collective (pooled) reserve component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics and (2) an individual reserve component for loans that do not share risk characteristics, consisting of collateral dependent, TDR, and expected TDR loans. Valley also maintains a separate allowance for unfunded credit commitments mainly consisting of undisbursed non-cancellable lines of credit, new loan commitments and commercial letters of credit. 

In estimating the component of the allowance on a collective basis we use a transition matrix model which calculates an expected life of loan loss percentage for each loan pool by generating probability of default and loss given default metrics. The metrics are based on the migration of loans from performing to loss by credit quality rating or delinquency categories using historical life-of-loan analysis periods for each loan portfolio pool, and the severity of loss, based on the aggregate net lifetime losses incurred. The model's expected losses based on loss history are adjusted for qualitative factors. Among other things, these adjustments include and account for differences in: (i) lending policies and procedures, (ii) current business conditions and economic developments that affect the loan collectability; (iii) concentration risks by size, type, and geography, new markets, (iv) the volume and migration of loans to non-performing status, and (v) the effect of external factors such as legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio. 

Valley utilizes a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period followed by a one-year period over which estimated losses revert to historical loss experience for the remaining life of the loan. The forecasts consist of a multi-scenario economic forecast model to estimate future credit losses and is governed by a cross-functional committee. The committee meets each quarter to determine which economic scenarios developed by Moody's will be incorporated into the model, as well as the relative probability weightings of the selected scenarios, based upon all readily available information. The model projects economic variables under each scenario based on detailed statistical analyses. We 

have identified and selected key variables that most closely correlated to our historical credit performance, which include: GDP, unemployment and the Case-Shiller Home Price Index. 

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2020 , we incorporated a probability weighted three-scenario economic forecast, including Moody's Scenario S-4, which includes the following assumptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic: 

&#8226; 

Assumes that the COVID-19 crisis will persist and continue to meaningfully impact the economy 

&#8226; 

National unemployment rate peaks at 16.9 percent in the second quarter of 2020 and will remain elevated throughout the remainder of the year. 

&#8226; 

Federal funds interest rates will remain at or near zero for foreseeable future. 

&#8226; 

A prolonged downturn in the economy until the fourth quarter of 2021. 

The allowance for credit losses for loans methodology and accounting policy are fully described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

(1) 

The adjustment represents an increase in the allowance for credit losses for loans as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2020. 

(2) 

Charge-offs and recoveries presented for periods prior to March 31, 2020 exclude loans formerly accounting for as PCI loans. 

(3) 

Periods prior to March 31, 2020 represent the allowance and provision for unfunded letters of credit only . 

Net loan charge-offs totaled $4.8 million for the first quarter 2020 as compared to $5.6 million and $5.3 million for the fourth quarter 2019 and first quarter 2019, respectively. The decrease in net loan charge-offs as compared to the fourth quarter 2019 was mainly due to better performance within the commercial and industrial loan category in the first quarter 2020 , partially offset by lower recoveries. The taxi medallion loan charge-offs totaled $1.3 million, $2.9 million and $1.3 million for the first quarter 2020 , fourth quarter 2019 and the first quarter 2019 , respectively. The overall level of loan charge-offs (as presented in the above table) continues to trend within management's expectations for the credit quality of the loan portfolio. 

During the first quarter 2020 , we recorded a $33.9 million provision for credit losses as compared to $5.4 million and $8.0 million for the fourth quarter 2019 and the first quarter 2019 , respectively. The increase in the first quarter 2020 provision as compared to the fourth quarter 2019 was mainly due to higher reserves recorded under CECL due to forecasted credit deterioration driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and loan growth, as well as higher specific reserves for non-accrual taxi medallion loans. 

The following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for credit losses for loans to loan portfolio categories and the allocations as a percentage of each loan category: &#160;

CECL was adopted January 1, 2020. Prior periods reflect the allowance for credit losses for loans under the incurred loss model. 

The allowance for credit losses, comprised of our allowance for loan losses and unfunded commitments (including letters of credit), as a percentage of total loans was 0.96 percent , 0.55 percent and 0.63 percent at March 31, 2020 , December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 , respectively. The increase at March 31, 2020 was largely due to the reserves related to PCD loans included in the Day 1 CECL adoption adjustment to the allowance for credit losses for loans and the reserve build under CECL during the first quarter 2020 related to the impact of COVID-19 and other factors. 

Capital Adequacy 

A significant measure of the strength of a financial institution is its shareholders&#8217; equity. At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , shareholders&#8217; equity totaled approximately $4.4 billion and represented 11.3 percent and 11.7 percent of total assets, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , total shareholders&#8217; equity increased by $36.8 million primarily due to (i) net income of $87.3 million , (ii) an increase in other comprehensive income of $25.6 million , and (iii) a $232 thousand increase attributable to the effect of our stock incentive plan. These positive changes were partially offset by (i) cash dividends declared on common and preferred stock totaling a combined $48.1 million , and (ii) a $28.2 million net cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings for the adoption of new accounting guidance as of January 1, 2020. 

Valley and Valley National Bank are subject to the regulatory capital requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Valley and Valley National Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of common equity Tier 1 capital, total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and Tier 1 capital to average assets, as defined in the regulations. 

We are required to maintain common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5 percent , Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6.0 percent , ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0 percent , and minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 percent , plus a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer added to the minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes. As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , Valley and Valley National Bank exceeded all capital adequacy requirements (see tables below). 

For regulatory capital purposes, in connection with the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s final interim rule as of April 3, 2020, 100 percent of the CECL Day 1 impact to shareholders' equity equaling $28.2 million after-tax will be deferred over a two-year period ending January 1, 2022, at which time it will be phased in on a pro-rata basis over a three-year period ending January 1, 2025. Additionally, 25 percent of the first quarter 2020 reserve build (i.e., provision for credit losses less net charge-offs) will be phased in over the same time frame. 

The following table presents Valley&#8217;s and Valley National Bank&#8217;s actual capital positions and ratios under Basel III risk-based capital guidelines at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 :

Management believes the tangible book value per common share ratio provides information useful to management and investors in understanding our underlying operational performance, our business and performance trends and facilitates comparisons with the performance of others in the financial services industry. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may also be calculated differently from similar measures disclosed by other companies. 

Typically, our primary source of capital growth is through retention of earnings. Our rate of earnings retention is derived by dividing undistributed earnings per common share by earnings (or net income available to common stockholders) per common share. Our retention ratio was 47.6 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to 49.4 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019 . Our retention ratio decreased slightly from the year ended December 31, 2019 mainly due to our higher provision for credit losses under CECL during the first quarter 2020, which was negatively impacted by forecasted losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Cash dividends declared amounted to $0.11 per common share for each of the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 . The Board is committed to examining and weighing relevant facts and considerations, including its commitment to shareholder value, each time it makes a cash dividend decision. The Federal Reserve has cautioned all bank holding companies about distributing dividends which may reduce the level of capital or not allow capital to grow considering the increased capital levels as required under the Basel III rules. Prior to the date of this filing, Valley has received no objection or adverse guidance from the FRB or the OCC regarding the current level of its quarterly common stock dividend. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Other Matters
