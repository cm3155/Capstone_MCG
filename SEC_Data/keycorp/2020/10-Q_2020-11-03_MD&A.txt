 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion &#38; Analysis of Financial Condition &#38; Results of Operations 

Introduction 

This section reviews the financial condition and results of operations of KeyCorp and its subsidiaries for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2020, and September 30, 2019. Some tables may include additional periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends in greater depth. When you read this discussion, you should also refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this report. The page locations of specific sections and notes that we refer to are presented in the Table of Contents. 

References to our &#8220;2019 Form 10-K&#8221; refer to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which has been filed with the SEC and is available on its website ( www.sec.gov ) and on our website ( www.key.com/ir ). 

Terminology 

Throughout this discussion, references to &#8220;Key,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and similar terms refer to the consolidated entity consisting of KeyCorp and its subsidiaries. &#8220;KeyCorp&#8221; refers solely to the parent holding company, and &#8220;KeyBank&#8221; refers to KeyCorp&#8217;s subsidiary bank, KeyBank National Association. 

We want to explain some industry-specific terms at the outset so you can better understand the discussion that follows. 

&#160; 

&#8226; We use the phrase continuing operations in this document to mean all of our businesses other than our government-guaranteed and private education lending business and Austin Capital Management, Ltd., which have been accounted for as discontinued operations since 2009. 

&#8226; We engage in capital markets activities primarily through business conducted by our Commercial Bank segment . These activities encompass a variety of products and services. Among other things, we trade securities as a dealer, enter into derivative contracts (both to accommodate clients&#8217; financing needs and to mitigate certain risks), and conduct transactions in foreign currencies (both to accommodate clients&#8217; needs and to benefit from fluctuations in exchange rates). 

&#8226; For regulatory purposes, capital is divided into two classes. Federal regulations currently prescribe that at least one-half of a bank or BHC&#8217;s total risk-based capital must qualify as Tier 1 capital . Both total and Tier 1 capital serve as bases for several measures of capital adequacy, which is an important indicator of financial stability and condition. Banking regulators evaluate a component of Tier 1 capital, known as Common Equity Tier 1 , under the Regulatory Capital Rules . The &#8220;Capital&#8221; section of this report under the heading &#8220;Capital adequacy&#8221; provides more information on total capital, Tier 1 capital, and the Regulatory Capital Rules, including Common Equity Tier 1, and describes how these measures are calculated.

Long-term financial targets 

Our financial outlook and results of operations have been impacted by the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our long-term targets have not changed as we expect to continue to deliver positive operating leverage and strong financial returns as we emerge from this period of economic and financial stress.

Positive Operating Leverage 

Generate positive operating leverage and a cash efficiency ratio in the range of 54.0% to 56.0% . 

Our results for the third quarter of 2020 continue to reflect the hard work and dedication of our team and their commitment to serving our clients as we work through the ongoing pandemic. Noninterest income was up from the year-ago quarter. Investment banking and debt placement fees and consumer mortgage income each had another solid quarter and cards and payments income and service charges on deposit accounts both posted strong linked quarter increases. Our expenses this quarter reflected higher variable costs related to cards and payments activity and production-related incentives, as well as elevated pandemic-related costs associated with keeping our teammates and clients safe. 

Moderate Risk Profile 

Maintain a moderate risk profile by targeting a net loan charge-offs to average loans ratio in the range of .40% to .60% through a credit cycle. 

Overall, credit quality remains very solid. Delinquencies improved quarter-over-quarter, with a six basis point decrease in our 30-89 day past dues, and the 90 day plus category also declining. Over the past quarter, the number of requests for loan forbearance has decreased dramatically. As of September 30, 2020, loans subject to forbearance terms were less than 1% based on the number of accounts for both commercial and consumer loans, and less than 2% when using outstanding balances. 

Financial Return 

A return on average tangible common equity in the range of 16.00% to 19.00%. 

We have continued to maintain a strong level of capital. We ended the third quarter of 2020 with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.5%. This places us at the upper end of our targeted range of 9.0% to 9.5%. We believe that this provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders. In the third quarter of 2020, we paid a common stock dividend of $.185 per share, which was consistent with our second quarter dividend level.

Strategic developments 

The third quarter of 2020 continued to pose unprecedented challenges given the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and widespread disruption to people&#8217;s lives and the economy. We have remained committed to supporting our employees, our communities, and our clients through these difficult times. Providing value to all stakeholders creates the foundation to deliver sustainable long-term performance. The corporate governance processes that we have in place allow us to oversee any changes and new requirements that may occur across our geographic footprint. Additionally, our strong financial performance in the third quarter demonstrated the resiliency of our team and business, the strength of our balance sheet, and our strong risk management practices. Here are just a few of the ways we have continued to respond to this unprecedented situation and some of the ways we plan to operate going forward: 

&#8226; Our business resiliency plans remained in effect and we maintained our operational effectiveness across the entire organization. The health and safety of our clients, employees, and communities in which we operate have continued to be our top priority. Nearly every branch has been open for business and continues to follow guidelines on how to minimize physical contact with our clients and between our employees. Our return-to-work protocols, which began in the second quarter of 2020, continued during the third quarter of 2020. This plan is flexible as the ongoing pandemic changes and may impact the communities in which our employees and clients operate differently. 

&#8226; We are committed to playing a critical role in providing capital and assistance to our clients and supporting broader initiatives to strengthen our economy. We continue to support our clients through payment deferrals, hardship support, borrower assistance programs, and forbearance options to help provide a bridge for individuals and businesses through these uncertain times. 

&#8226; Although our financial outlook has been impacted by the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are operating from a position of strength . Our business model and clear strategy position us well during this period of economic and financial stress and we believe it will provide us with significant opportunities through the recovery phase. Our long-term financial targets have not changed and on the other side of this crisis, we expect to continue to deliver positive operating leverage and strong financial returns. However, given our inability to estimate the impact of the pandemic on our business and operations in 2020, we previously withdrew our financial outlook for the full year 2020 that was issued on January 23, 2020. 

&#8226; Credit quality is also playing a critical role in this environment. Our risk profile and strategy is different than the one we had leading up to, and during, the 2007-2009 financial crisis. We have significantly reduced our exposure to high-risk sectors and industries and have positioned Key to perform well through all phases of the business cycle, including highly stressed environments, like the one in which we operated during the last seven months. Our moderate risk profile will continue to inform our credit decisions and the way we underwrite loans. 

&#8226; Capital and liquidity continued to be clear strengths for us during the third quarter of 2020. We participated in several rounds of government-mandated stress tests since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. These tests have shown that we would remain well capitalized through periods of severe economic and financial stress while continuing to support our clients and the communities in which we operate. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity, and capital positions us to weather adverse economic scenarios, while continuing to support our clients, invest in our business, and provide returns for our shareholders. During the third quarter of 2020, we maintained our common stock dividend at the same level as the second quarter of 2020.

Supervision and regulation 

The following discussion provides a summary of recent regulatory developments and should be read in conjunction with the disclosure included in our 2019 Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; in Item 1. Business and under the heading &#8220;II. Compliance Risk&#8221; in Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Regulatory capital requirements 

The final rule to implement the Basel III international capital framework (&#8220;Basel III&#8221;) was effective January 1, 2015, with a multi-year transition period (&#8220;Regulatory Capital Rules&#8221;). As of April 1, 2020, the Regulatory Capital Rules are fully phased-in for Key. The Basel III capital framework and the U.S. implementation of the Basel III capital framework are discussed in more detail in Item 1.

Under the Regulatory Capital Rules, standardized approach banking organizations, such as KeyCorp and KeyBank, are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in Figure 2 below. At September 30, 2020, KeyCorp&#8217;s ratios under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules are set forth in Figure 2.

(c) Ratios reflect the five-year transition of CECL impacts on regulatory ratios. 

Revised prompt corrective action framework 

The federal prompt corrective action (&#8220;PCA&#8221;) framework under the FDIA groups FDIC-insured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories: &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized,&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; In addition to implementing the Basel III capital framework in the United States, the Regulatory Capital Rules also revised the PCA capital category threshold ratios applicable to FDIC-insured depository institutions such as KeyBank, with an effective date of January 1, 2015. The revised PCA framework table in Figure 3 identifies the capital category thresholds for a &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and an &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; institution under the PCA Framework.

(a) A &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; institution also must not be subject to any written agreement, order, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 

(b) As a &#8220;standardized approach&#8221; banking organization, KeyBank is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which became effective January 1, 2018. 

We believe that, as of September 30, 2020, KeyBank (consolidated) satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements necessary to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; for purposes of the PCA framework. However, investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of KeyBank because the PCA framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function. Moreover, it is important to note that the PCA framework does not apply to BHCs, like KeyCorp. 

Recent regulatory capital-related developments 

A final rule adopted by the federal banking agencies in February 2019 provides banking organizations with the option to phase in, over a three-year period, the adverse day-one regulatory capital effects of the adoption of the CECL accounting standard. On March 27, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that gives banking organizations that are required under U.S. accounting standards to adopt CECL before the end of 2020 the 

Table of contents 

option to delay for two years CECL&#8217;s adverse effects on regulatory capital (&#8220;CECL Interim Final Rule&#8221;). This is in addition to the three-year transition period already in place, resulting in an optional five-year transition. The agencies noted that this relief is being provided in order to allow banking organizations to better focus on lending to creditworthy households and businesses affected by recent strains on the U.S. economy caused by COVID-19. 

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (&#8220;CARES Act&#8221;), enacted on March 27, 2020, provides banking organizations with the option to not comply with CECL until the earlier of (i) the termination date of the national emergency concerning COVID-19 declared by the President under the National Emergencies Act; or (ii) December 31, 2020. The federal banking agencies issued a statement on March 31, 2020, indicating that banking organizations that elect to use the optional, temporary statutory relief will be able to elect the remaining period of regulatory capital relief provided under the CECL Interim Final Rule after the end of the statutory relief period. Alternatively, banking organizations may adopt CECL as planned in 2020 and use the regulatory capital relief provided under the CECL Interim Final Rule starting at the time of their adoption of CECL. 

On August 26, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that is substantially similar to the CECL Interim Final Rule. Like the CECL Interim Final Rule, the final rule gives eligible banking organizations the option to mitigate the estimated adverse effects on regulatory capital of CECL for two years, followed by a three-year transition period, which results in an optional five-year transition. The final rule expands the group of institutions eligible for this optional five-year transition to include any institution adopting CECL in 2020. The final rule also includes certain minor adjustments to clarify the calculation of the transitional amount. Key elected to adopt CECL as planned in the first quarter of 2020 and exercise the option to use a five-year transition to measure CECL&#8217;s effects on regulatory capital. 

See Item 1. Business of our 2019 Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Regulatory capital requirements &#8212; Recent regulatory capital-related developments&#8221; for a discussion of other recent regulatory capital-related developments. 

Capital planning and stress testing 

On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule integrating certain aspects of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulatory Capital Rules with CCAR and the stress test rules in order to simplify the overall capital framework that is currently applicable to BHCs that have $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets (including KeyCorp). Under the final rule, the Federal Reserve amended the capital conservation buffer requirement under the Regulatory Capital Rules by replacing the static risk-weighted assets component of the buffer with a new measure, the stress capital buffer, which will be based on the results of an individual BHC&#8217;s supervisory stress test and cannot be less than 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. A firm will be subject to limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments if it does not satisfy all minimum capital requirements and its stress capital buffer requirement. A firm&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement will become effective on October 1 of each year and will remain in effect until September 30 of the following year unless the firm receives an updated stress capital buffer requirement from the Federal Reserve. 

On March 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies published an interim final rule that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies&#8217; Regulatory Capital Rules. The revised definition applies to all buffer requirements applicable to a banking organization, including the stress capital buffer requirement adopted by the Federal Reserve on March 4, 2020. The revised definition of eligible retained income will make any automatic limitations on capital distributions that could apply under the agencies&#8217; capital rules more gradual with the objective of promoting continued lending during a period of stress, including the period of stress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 26, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that adopts, without change, the interim final rule issued in March 2020 that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies&#8217; Regulatory Capital Rules. 

In April 2020, we submitted our 2020 capital plan to the Federal Reserve under the Federal Reserve&#8217;s CCAR process. On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve publicly announced the results of its CCAR process and the supervisory stress test that it conducted of 33 BHCs having more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets (including KeyCorp). The Federal Reserve indicated that it will use the results of this stress test to set the new stress capital buffer requirement for these firms, which will take effect in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Federal Reserve also announced the results of a sensitivity analysis it conducted to assess the resiliency of these firms under three hypothetical downside scenarios which could result from the COVID-19 disruptions. 

Table of contents 

Because of the results of its sensitivity analysis, the Federal Reserve decided to take certain actions to require large banking organizations to preserve capital and re-evaluate their capital plans. Specifically, the Federal Reserve stated that it is requiring each firm subject to its capital plan rule to update and resubmit its capital plan to the appropriate Reserve Bank within 45 days after the Federal Reserve provides updated scenarios. The Federal Reserve further indicated that for the third quarter of 2020, these firms are prohibited from (i) making share repurchases (other than share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock for employee stock ownership plans); and (ii) paying common stock dividends that exceed the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020 or exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm&#8217;s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters unless otherwise specified by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve said that it may extend these restrictions quarter-by-quarter depending upon the economic circumstances. 

On June 30, 2020, KeyCorp announced that its preliminary stress capital requirement, provided by the Federal Reserve as part of the 2020 Federal Reserve capital stress testing exercise, is 2.5%, which represents the minimum buffer required for banking organizations the size of Key. KeyCorp also announced that its capital plans included maintaining its common stock dividend for the third quarter of 2020 at the same level as the second quarter of 2020, subject to approval by KeyCorp&#8217;s Board of Directors, which the Board subsequently approved on July 8, 2020. On August 10, 2020, the Federal Reserve confirmed KeyCorp&#8217;s stress capital requirement of 2.5%. 

On September 17, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced three supervisory scenarios (baseline, severely adverse, and alternative severe) that firms subject to the. Federal Reserve&#8217;s capital plan rule must use in preparing their updated 2020 capital plan resubmissions and that the Federal Reserve will use in conducting its updated stress analyses of these firms. The Federal Reserve stated that it will release firm-specific results from the firms&#8217; performance under these scenarios by the end of 2020. 

Due to the continued economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic, the Federal Reserve announced on September 30, 2020, that it was extending for an additional quarter certain measures to ensure that large banking organizations maintain a high level of capital resilience. Specifically, the Federal Reserve stated that banking organizations with more than $100 billion in total assets will be subject to the same prohibition on share repurchases and limitation on dividend payments for the fourth quarter of 2020 that they were subject to for the third quarter of 2020. 

On September 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve invited public comment on a proposal to make conforming changes to the capital planning, regulatory reporting, and stress capital buffer requirements for firms subject to Category IV standards (including KeyCorp) to be consistent with the tailored regulatory framework for large banking organizations that the Federal Reserve adopted in an October 2019 rulemaking. The proposal would revise the elements of the annual capital plan that Category IV firms are required to submit to the Federal Reserve and would make related changes to regulatory reporting requirements. Also, the proposal would update the frequency for calculating the stress capital buffer for these firms. In addition, the proposal would make certain clarifying changes to the stress testing rules applicable to all large banking organizations. The Federal Reserve further requested comment on all aspects of its capital planning guidance. Comments are due by November 20, 2020. 

See Item 1. Business of our 2019 Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory capital requirements - Capital planning and stress testing&#8221; for an overview of capital planning and stress testing requirements. 

Liquidity requirements 

On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement the net stable funding ratio (&#8220;NSFR&#8221;). The NSFR final rule, which is effective on July 1, 2021, requires certain banking organizations with more than $100 billion in total assets to maintain minimum amounts of stable funding to support their assets, commitments, and derivatives exposures over a one-year time horizon. The final NSFR rule tailors the application of the NSFR requirement to large banking organizations in each of four risk-based categories of institutions. Key is a Category IV firm. Category IV firms with average weighted short-term wholesale funding of less than $50 billion will not be subject to an NSFR requirement. Key believes that it does not meet the $50 billion threshold and that it will not be subject to an NSFR requirement.

Volcker Rule 

The Volcker Rule is discussed in detail in Item 1. Business of our 2019 Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Supervision and Regulation - Other Regulatory Developments &#8212; Volcker Rule.&#8221; 

On June 25, 2020, five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to clarify and streamline the covered fund-related provisions of the Volcker Rule. Among other things, the final rule (i) permits certain low-risk transactions (including intraday credit, riskless principal, and payment, clearing, and settlement transactions) between a banking entity and covered funds for which the banking entity serves as the investment adviser, investment manager, or sponsor; (ii) clarifies exclusions from the covered fund definition for foreign public funds, loan securitizations, small business investment companies, and public welfare investment funds; and (iii) permits banking entities to invest in or sponsor certain types of funds that do not raise the concerns that the Volcker Rule was intended to address, such as credit funds, venture capital funds, customer facilitation funds, and family wealth management vehicles. The final rule became effective on October 1, 2020. 

Control standards 

On January 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule setting forth a new, comprehensive framework for determining control under the BHCA and the Home Owners&#8217; Loan Act. The final rule simplifies and provides greater transparency regarding the standards used by the Federal Reserve to determine whether one company has control over another company. The final rule codifies existing Federal Reserve precedents on control and makes certain targeted adjustments to these precedents. The final rule provides a tiered framework that looks at the size of an investing company&#8217;s voting and total equity investment in another company along with a variety of other factors, including board representation, officer and employee interlocks, and the existence of business relationships between the companies. By providing greater clarity regarding the standards that will be applied for control determinations, the final rule may facilitate (1) BHCs making minority investments in nonbank companies and (2) nonbank investors taking minority stakes in banking organizations. On March 31, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it was delaying the effective date of the new control final rule to September 30, 2020, from the original date of April 1, 2020, in order to reduce operational burdens on organizations affected by this rule. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

The Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) was enacted in 1977 to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities that they serve, including low- and moderate-income (&#8220;LMI&#8221;) neighborhoods, consistent with the institutions&#8217; safe and sound operations. The CRA requires the federal banking agencies to assess the record of each institution that they supervise in meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including LMI neighborhoods. 

On May 20, 2020, the OCC issued a final rule to revise the agency&#8217;s CRA regulation to strengthen and modernize the framework by which the OCC assesses a bank&#8217;s CRA performance. The OCC stated that it was doing so in order to make the CRA regulatory framework more objective, transparent, consistent in application, and reflective of changes in banking and thereby better achieve the statutory purpose of encouraging banks to serve the needs of their communities, particularly LMI neighborhoods and other communities that have been underserved. The final rule (i) clarifies and expands the activities that qualify for CRA credit; (ii) updates the definition of the assessment areas where activities are evaluated for CRA purposes; (iii) creates a more consistent and objective method for evaluating CRA performance; and (iv) provides for more timely and transparent CRA-related data collection, recordkeeping, and reporting. The OCC indicated that it was deferring to a future rulemaking the decision for how to calibrate the thresholds and benchmarks used in the rule to determine the level of performance necessary for a bank to achieve a specific performance rating. The final rule became effective on October 1, 2020. Large national banks, like KeyBank, are required to comply with the rule by January 1, 2023. 

On September 21, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (&#8220;ANPR&#8221;) requesting public comment on ways to modernize CRA regulations by strengthening, clarifying, and tailoring them to reflect the current banking landscape and better achieve the core purpose of the CRA. The ANPR seeks public feedback on ways to evaluate how banks meet the needs of LMI communities and address inequities in credit 

Table of contents 

access. When it issued the ANPR, the Federal Reserve said that it hoped the ANPR would provide a foundation for the federal banking agencies to come together on a consistent approach to CRA regulation that has broad support among all stakeholders. Comments are due on February 16, 2021. If the federal banking agencies agree on a consistent approach to revising their CRA regulations, KeyBank will be required to comply with the revised regulations. 

Regulatory developments concerning COVID-19 

Federal, state, and local governments have adopted various statutes, rules, regulations, orders, and guidelines in order to address the COVID-19 pandemic and the adverse economic effects of this pandemic on individuals, families, businesses, and governments. Financial institutions, including Key, are affected by many of these measures, including measures that are broadly applicable to businesses operating in the communities where Key does business. Financial services firms, like other businesses, are required to operate in a manner that seeks to protect the health and safety of their customers and employees. 

During the COVID-19 crisis, the federal banking agencies issued a number of statements encouraging financial institutions to meet the financial needs of their customers and have taken steps to provide financial institutions with additional flexibility to meet their customers&#8217; needs. Certain of these steps are discussed above under the headings &#8220;Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Regulatory capital requirements &#8212; Recent regulatory capital-related developments&#8221; and &#8220;Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Capital planning and stress testing.&#8221; In addition, the federal banking agencies along with state bank regulators issued an interagency statement on March 22, 2020, addressing loan modifications that are made by financial institutions for borrowers affected by the COVID-19 crisis. The agencies stated that short-term loan modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 for borrowers who were current prior to any relief do not need to be categorized as TDRs and that financial institutions are not expected to designate loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 as past due because of the deferral. 

The CARES Act, enacted on March 27, 2020, contains a number of provisions that affect banking organizations. The CARES Act provides funding for various programs under which the federal government will lend to, guarantee loans to, or make investments in, businesses. Banking organizations are expected to play a role in some of these programs, and when they do so, they will be subject to certain requirements. One of these programs is the PPP, a program administered by the Small Business Administration (the &#8220;SBA&#8221;) to provide loans to small businesses for payroll and other basic expenses during the COVID-19 crisis. The loans can be made by SBA-certified lenders and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied, in which event the SBA will make payment to the lender for the forgiven amounts. KeyBank has participated in the PPP as a lender. 

The CARES Act also authorizes temporary changes to certain provisions applicable to banking organizations. Among other changes, the CARES Act gives financial institutions the right to elect to suspend GAAP principles and regulatory determinations for loan modifications relating to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as TDRs from March 1, 2020, through the earlier of December 31, 2020, or 60 days after the COVID-19 national emergency ends. In addition, the CARES Act requires mortgage servicers to grant, on a borrower&#8217;s request, forbearance for up to 180 days (which can be extended for an additional 180 days) on a federally-backed single-family mortgage loan or forbearance for up to 30 days (which can be extended for two additional 30-day periods) on a federally-backed multi-family mortgage loan when the borrowers experience financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 emergency. 

On April 3, 2020, federal banking agencies along with state bank regulators issued a joint statement indicating that the agencies do not plan to take supervisory or enforcement action against mortgage servicers for delays in taking loss-mitigation actions or sending notices required by the mortgage servicing rules if they provide short-term forbearance on mortgage loans to borrowers facing hardships relating to the COVID-19 emergency, including forbearance provided in accordance with the CARES Act, provided that the mortgage servicers make good faith efforts to take these actions and send these notices within a reasonable time. 

On April 7, 2020, the federal banking agencies, in consultation with state bank regulators, issued an interagency statement clarifying the interaction between (i) their earlier statement discussing whether loan modifications relating to COVID-19 need to be treated as TDRs; and (ii) the CARES Act provision on this subject. In this interagency statement, the agencies also said that when exercising supervisory and enforcement responsibility with respect to consumer protection requirements, they will take into account the unique circumstances impacting borrowers and institutions resulting from the COVID-19 emergency and that they do not expect to take a consumer compliance 

Table of contents 

public enforcement action against an institution, provided that the circumstances were related to this emergency and the institution made good faith efforts to support borrowers and comply with the consumer protection requirements and addressed any needed corrective action. 

The Federal Reserve has established several lending facilities that are intended to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and governments. One of these facilities is the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (&#8220;PPPLF&#8221;) which was set up to allow the Federal Reserve Banks to extend credit to financial institutions that originate PPP loans, taking the loans as collateral at face value. On April 9, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule to allow banking organizations to neutralize the effect of PPP loans financed under the PPPLF on the leverage capital ratios of these organizations. On September 29, 2020, the federal banking agencies announced their adoption of this interim final rule as a final rule. In addition, on June 22, 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule that mitigates the impact of PPP lending on banks&#8217; deposit insurance assessments. Also, in accordance with the CARES Act, a PPP loan will be assigned a risk weight of zero percent under the federal banking agencies&#8217; risk-based capital rules. 

On June 23, 2020, the federal banking agencies, in conjunction with state bank regulators, issued interagency examiner guidance outlining supervisory principles for assessing the safety and soundness of banks given the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The agencies stated that they will consider the unique, evolving, and potentially long-term nature of the issues that banks are confronting and will exercise appropriate flexibility in their supervisory response. The agencies said that they will continue to assess institutions in accordance with existing agency policies and procedures and will consider whether a bank&#8217;s management has managed risk appropriately, including taking appropriate actions in response to stresses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Results of Operations 

Earnings overview 

The following chart provides a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2019, to the three months ended September 30, 2020 (dollars in millions): 

The following discussion explains the key factors that caused these elements to change. Given our inability to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on our business and operations in 2020, we previously withdrew our financial outlook for the full-year 2020 that was issued on January 23, 2020. 

Net interest income 

Table of contents 

One of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including: 

&#160; 

&#8226; the volume, pricing, mix, and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; 

&#8226; the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital; 

&#8226; the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk; 

&#8226; interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; 

&#8226; asset quality; and 

&#8226; fair value accounting of acquired earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

To make it easier to compare both the results across several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a &#8220;TE basis&#8221; (i.e., as if all income were taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $126, an amount that, if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, would yield $100. 

Figure 4 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense and their respective yields or rates over the past five quarters. This figure also presents a reconciliation of TE net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those quarters. The net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding, is calculated by dividing annualized TE net interest income by average earning assets. 

TE net interest income was $1.0 billion for the third quarter of 2020, compared to TE net interest income of $980 million for the third quarter of 2019. The increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances partially offset by a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin was impacted by lower interest rates and a change in balance sheet mix, including elevated levels of liquidity and our participation in the PPP. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, TE net interest income was $3.0 billion , an increase of $66 million from the same period last year. The increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances partly offset by a lower net interest margin. Similar to the third quarter of 2020, the lower net interest margin reflects lower interest rates and a lag in deposit pricing as interest rates declined, elevated levels of liquidity, and our participation in the PPP. 

Table of contents 

Average loans were $104.9 billion for the third quarter of 2020, an increase of $13.0 billion compared to the third quarter of 2019. Commercial loans increased $9.4 billion, reflecting growth from the PPP, as well as core broad-based growth in commercial and industrial loans and increased utilization versus the year-ago period. Consumer loans increased $3.6 billion, driven by strength from Laurel Road and Key's consumer mortgage business. 

Average deposits totaled $134.9 billion for the third quarter of 2020, an increase of $24.7 billion compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting growth from consumer and commercial relationships, partially offset by a decline in time deposits as a result of lower interest rates.

Provision for credit losses 

Our provision for credit losses was $160 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to $200 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. The provision for credit losses was $1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to $336 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. We adopted the CECL accounting standard effective January 1, 2020, and the economic scenario used in the estimation of expected credit losses as of September 30, 2020, was materially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the third quarter of 2019, our provision for credit losses was impacted by the realization of $123 million from a previously disclosed fraud loss. 

Noninterest income 

As shown in Figure 5, noninterest income was $681 million, and represented 40% of total revenue for the third quarter of 2020, compared to $650 million, representing 40% of total revenue, for the year-ago quarter. 

The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change. 

Figure 5. Noninterest Income 

(a) Other noninterest income includes operating lease income and other leasing gains, corporate services income, corporate-owned life insurance income, consumer mortgage income, commercial mortgage servicing fees, and other income. See the "Consolidated Statements of Income" in Item 1. Financial Statements of this report. 

Table of contents 

Trust and investment services income 

Trust and investment services income consists of brokerage commissions, trust and asset management fees, and insurance income. The assets under management that primarily generate these revenues are shown in Figure 6. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, trust and investment services income increased $10 million, 

or 8.5%, compared to the same period one year ago. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, trust and investment services income increased $29 million, or 8.2%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2019. These increases were primarily due to an increase in trust and asset management fees partially related to higher levels of assets under management. 

A significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. At September 30, 2020, our bank, trust, and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $41.3 billion, compared to $39.4 billion at September 30, 2019. Assets under management were up, as shown in Figure 6, due to increased portfolio yields.

Investment banking and debt placement fees 

Investment banking and debt placement fees consists of syndication fees, debt and equity financing fees, financial adviser fees, gains on sales of commercial mortgages, and agency origination fees. Investment banking and debt placement fees for the three months ended September 30, 2020, decreased $30 million, or 17.0%, from the year-ago quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, investment banking and debt placement fees decreased $31 million, or 6.9%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2019. These decreases were primarily driven by lower syndication and merger and acquisition fees, partially offset by higher gains on the sales of commercial mortgages. 

Table of contents 

Service charges on deposit accounts 

Service charges on deposit accounts decreased $9 million, or 10.5%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same period one year ago. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, service charges on deposit accounts decreased $22 million, or 8.8%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2019. These decreases were primarily due to lower customer spending and higher fee waivers related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 

Cards and payments income 

Cards and payments income, which consists of debit card, prepaid card, consumer and commercial credit card, and merchant services income, increased $45 million, or 65.2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same period one year ago. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, cards and payments income increased $63 million, or 30.3%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2019. These increases were driven by increased prepaid card activity due to state support program activity. 

Other noninterest income 

Other noninterest income includes operating lease income and other leasing gains, corporate services income, 

corporate-owned life insurance income, consumer mortgage income, commercial mortgage servicing fees, and other income. Other noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2020, increased $15 million, or 7.5%, from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to higher consumer mortgage income driven by strong loan originations and related fees. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, other noninterest income was up $3 million, or .6%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily due to higher consumer mortgage income driven by strong loan originations and related fees. Partially offsetting this was a decline in other income related to market-related valuation adjustments of customer derivatives due to the significant increase in credit spreads, as well as trading losses and portfolio marks also related to the widening credit spreads in the market that occurred in the first quarter of 2020. 

Noninterest expense 

As shown in Figure 7, noninterest expense was $1.0 billion for the third quarter of 2020, compared to $939 million for the third quarter of 2019. 

The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change. 

Table of contents 

Figure 7. Noninterest Expense &#160; 

(a) Other noninterest expense includes equipment, operating lease expense, marketing, FDIC assessment, intangible asset amortization, OREO expense, net, and other expense. See the "Consolidated Statements of Income" in Item 1. Financial Statements of this report. 

Personnel 

Personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, increased by $41 million, or 7.5%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same period one year ago reflected higher production-related incentives, merit increases, and employee benefits costs, as well as higher FTE count compared to the year ago quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, personnel expense was down $24 million, or 1.4%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily due to lower severance expenses. 

Net occupancy 

Net occupancy expense increased $4 million, or 5.6%, for the third quarter of 2020, compared to the same period one year ago. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, net occupancy expense increased $6 million, or 2.8%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2019. These increases were primarily due to higher property reserve expenses and cleaning expenses related to the steps that we have taken to ensure the health and safety of teammates and customers during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. 

Other noninterest expense 

Other noninterest expense includes equipment, operating lease expense, marketing, FDIC assessment, intangible asset amortization, OREO expense, and other miscellaneous expense categories. Other noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2020, increased $41 million, or 18.3%, from the year-ago quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, other noninterest expense was up $61 million, or 8.6%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2019. These increases were primarily related to higher payments-related expenses from prepaid card activity incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

Table of contents 

Income taxes 

We recorded tax expense of $60 million for the third quarter of 2020 and $70 million for the third quarter of 2019. 

Our federal tax expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance and credits associated with renewable energy and low-income housing investments, and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves. 

Additional information pertaining to how our tax expense (benefit) and the resulting effective tax rates were derived is included in Note 14 (&#8220;Income Taxes&#8221;) beginning on page 148 of our 2019 Form 10-K.

Consumer Bank 

Summary of operations 

&#8226; Net income attributable to Key of $241 million for the third quarter of 2020, compared to $196 million for the year-ago quarter 

&#8226; Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $9 million, or 1.5%, compared to the third quarter of 2019, as a result of strong balance sheet growth, partially offset by the lower interest rate environment 

&#8226; Average loans and leases increased $8.7 billion, or 26.6%, driven by benefit from the PPP, as well as growth from consumer mortgage and Laurel Road 

&#8226; Average deposits increased $10.2 billion, or 13.9%, from the third quarter of 2019, driven by consumer stimulus payments and relationship growth 

Table of contents 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses decreased $64 million compared to the third quarter of 2019, due to the recapture of provision between the second and third quarters of 2020 from lower net charge-offs and a reduced allowance, driven by improved macroeconomic factors and continued strength in client credit quality 

&#8226; Noninterest income increased $29 million, or 12.2%, from the year ago quarter, driven by strength in consumer mortgage income and higher trust and investment services income, partially offset by lower consumer spend activity 

&#8226; Noninterest expense increased $42 million, or 7.9%, from the year ago quarter driven by higher variable expenses from production-related incentives and higher loan volumes 

Commercial Bank 

Summary of operations 

&#8226; Net income attributable to Key of $160 million for the third quarter of 2020, compared to $301 million for the year-ago quarter 

&#8226; Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $22 million, or 5.5%, compared to the third quarter of 2019, with balance sheet growth partially offset by the lower interest rate environment 

&#8226; Average loan and lease balances increased $4.7 billion, or 8.1%, compared to the third quarter of 2019, driven by growth in commercial and industrial loans from line draws and PPP loans 

&#8226; Average deposit balances increased $15 billion, or 41.5%, compared to the third quarter of 2019, driven by growth in targeted relationships and the impact of government programs 

Table of contents 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses increased $131 million compared to the third quarter of 2019, driven by an increase in net charge-offs and higher reserve levels 

&#8226; Noninterest income increased $2 million, from the third quarter of 2019, as higher cards and payments income related to prepaid card revenue was partially offset by declines in investment banking and corporate services income 

&#8226; Noninterest expense increased by $65 million, or 17.2%, from the third quarter of 2019 driven by elevated variable expenses related to prepaid card

COVID-19 Hardship Relief Programs 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in March 2020, we began providing relief and flexibility to our customers through a variety of solutions, including fee waivers, short-term loan modifications, and payment deferrals as well as the suspension of vehicle repossessions and home foreclosures. While the solutions for our commercial borrowers are individually negotiated and tailored to each borrower&#8217;s specific facts and circumstances, the most commonly offered relief measures included temporary covenant waivers and/or deferrals of principal and/or interest payments for up to 90 days. We have also granted short-term loan modifications for our consumer loan customers through extensions, deferrals, and forbearance. As of September 30, 2020, commercial loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $3.1 billion, representing 4.4% of the commercial portfolio, have been modified as a result of a COVID-19 hardship. As of September 30, 2020, consumer loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $1.8 billion, representing 6.2% of the consumer portfolio, have been modified as a result of a COVID-19 hardship. 

Under the CARES Act as well as banking regulator interagency guidance, certain loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial distress as a result of the economic impacts created by COVID-19 may not be required to be treated as TDRs under U.S. GAAP. For COVID-19 related loan modifications which occurred from March 1, 2020, through September 30, 2020, and met the loan modification criteria under either the CARES Act or the criteria specified by the regulatory agencies or were otherwise considered to be short term in nature, we have elected to suspend TDR accounting for such loan modifications. Additionally, loans qualifying for these modifications are not required to be reported as delinquent, nonaccrual, impaired, or criticized solely as a result of a COVID-19 loan modification. Refer to Note 4 (&#8220;Asset Quality&#8221;) under the headings &#8220;TDRs&#8221; and &#8220;Nonperforming and Past Due Loans&#8221;. 

For loans that receive a payment deferral or forbearance under these hardship relief programs, we continue to accrue interest and recognize interest income during the period of the deferral. Depending on the terms of each program, all or a portion of this accrued interest may be paid directly by the borrower (either during the relief period, at the end of the relief period, or at maturity of the loan) or added to the customer&#8217;s outstanding balance. For certain programs, the maturity date of the loan may also be extended by the number of payments deferred. Interest income will continue to be accrued at the original contractual interest rate unless that rate is concurrently modified upon entering the relief program (in which case, the modified rate would be used to recognize interest). 

Commercial loan portfolio 

Commercial loans outstanding were $74.5 billion at September 30, 2020, an increase of $6.4 billion, or 9.5%, compared to December 31, 2019, driven by the funding of over $8 billion of loans related to the PPP partly offset by a decline in commercial and industrial utilization rates. 

As a result of the current economic environment, our commercial loan portfolio is going through active portfolio surveillance. We are conducting ongoing portfolio reviews on our commercial loans with any risk rating migrations being closely monitored. We have centralized internal reporting on enterprise-wide relief initiatives, as well as following any potential relief initiatives that may come in the future. We have also established a pandemic watchlist and are performing ongoing reviews of commercial clients that are likely to be impacted by COVID-19. Overall, most of these clients represent a small portion of the overall portfolio and are diversified by type and geography. Figure 9 summarizes our commercial portfolios that are at risk of being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as of September 30, 2020.

Commercial and industrial. Commercial and industrial loans are the largest component of our loan portfolio, representing 53% of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2020, and 51% at December 31, 2019. This portfolio is approximately 72% variable rate and consists of loans originated primarily to large corporate, middle market, and small business clients. 

Commercial and industrial loans totaled $55.0 billion at September 30, 2020, an increase of $6.7 billion, or 13.9%, compared to December 31, 2019. The growth was broad-based and spread across most industry categories, as the impact of COVID-19 resulted in over $8 billion of loans related to the PPP partly offset by a decline in commercial line utilization rates. 

Commercial real estate loans . Our commercial real estate portfolio includes both mortgage and construction loans and is originated through two primary sources: our 15-state banking franchise, and KeyBank Real Estate Capital, a national line of business within the Commercial Bank that cultivates relationships with owners of commercial real estate located both within and beyond the branch system. Nonowner-occupied properties, generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties, represented 80% of total commercial real estate loans outstanding at September 30, 2020. Construction loans, which provide a stream of funding for properties not fully leased at origination to support debt service payments over the term of the contract or project, represented 13% of commercial real estate loans at period end. 

At September 30, 2020, commercial real estate loans totaled $15.0 billion, which includes $1.9 billion of construction loans. Compared to December 31, 2019, this portfolio decreased $43 million, or .3%. We continue to

focus primarily on owners of completed and stabilized commercial real estate in accordance with our relationship strategy. 

As shown in Figure 11, our commercial real estate loan portfolio includes various property types and geographic 

locations of the underlying collateral. These loans include commercial mortgage and construction loans in both

Consumer loan portfolio 

Consumer loans outstanding as of September 30, 2020, increased by $2.0 billion, or 7.5%, from December 31, 2019, driven by growth from the consumer mortgage business, Laurel Road, and indirect auto loans. On October 21, 2020, we announced that we would no longer originate indirect auto loans. The current portfolio of approximately $4.6 billion will run off over time. 

The home equity portfolio is comprised of loans originated by our Consumer Bank within our 15-state footprint and is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio, representing 33% of consumer loans outstanding at September 30, 2020. 

Table of contents 

We held the first lien position for approximately 64% of the home equity portfolio at September 30, 2020, and 61% at December 31, 2019. For loans with real estate collateral, we track borrower performance monthly. Regardless of the lien position, credit metrics are refreshed quarterly, including recent FICO scores as well as updated loan-to-value ratios. This information is used in establishing the ALLL. Our methodology is described in Note 1 (&#8220;Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies&#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses&#8221; of this report.

In the event of default by a borrower, we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately $5.7 billion of the $392.2 billion of loans administered or serviced at September 30, 2020. Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 17 (&#8220;Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees&#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Recourse agreement with FNMA.&#8221; 

We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as &#8220;Consumer mortgage income&#8221; and &#8220;Commercial mortgage servicing fees&#8221;) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing loans. Additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in Note 8 (&#8220;Mortgage Servicing Assets&#8221;). 

Securities 

Our securities portfolio totaled $35.3 billion at September 30, 2020, compared to $31.9 billion at December 31, 2019. Available-for-sale securities were $26.9 billion at September 30, 2020, compared to $21.8 billion at December 31, 2019. Held-to-maturity securities were $8.4 billion at September 30, 2020, and $10.1 billion at December 31, 2019. 

As shown in Figure 15, all of our mortgage-backed securities, which include both securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities, are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA and traded in liquid secondary markets. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the available-for-sale portfolio and at amortized cost for the held-to-maturity portfolio. For more information about these securities, see Note 1 (&#8220;Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies&#8221;), Note 5 (&#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221;) under the headings &#8220;Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques,&#8221; and Note 6 (&#8220;Securities&#8221;).

Securities available for sale 

The majority of our securities available for sale portfolio consists of federal agency CMOs and mortgage-backed securities. CMOs are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. These mortgage securities generate interest income, serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements, and provide liquidity value under regulatory requirements. 

Figure 16 shows the composition, yields, and remaining maturities of our securities available for sale. For more information about these securities, including gross unrealized gains and losses by type of security and securities pledged, see Note 6 (&#8220;Securities&#8221;).

Deposits and other sources of funds 

Figure 18. Breakdown of Deposits at September 30, 2020 

Deposits are our primary source of funding. At September 30, 2020, our deposits totaled $136.7 billion, an increase of $24.9 billion compared to December 31, 2019. The increase was driven by existing relationships and targeted strategic growth of commercial clients, as well as growth from consumer stimulus payments and lower consumer spending. 

Wholesale funds, consisting of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, totaled $13.7 billion at September 30, 2020, compared to $13.5 billion at December 31, 2019. Strong deposit growth and elevated levels of liquidity resulted in less reliance on wholesale funds to support the growth in the balance sheet at September 30, 2020. 

Capital 

The objective of capital management is to maintain capital levels consistent with our risk appetite and of a sufficient amount to operate under a wide range of economic conditions. We have identified three primary uses of capital: 

1. Investing in our businesses, supporting our clients, and loan growth; 

2. Maintaining or increasing our Common Share dividend; and 

3. Returning capital in the form of Common Share repurchases to our shareholders. 

The following sections discuss certain ways we have deployed our capital. For further information, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity and Note 19 (&#8220;Shareholders' Equity&#8221;). 

Table of contents 

(a) Common Share repurchases were suspended during the first quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

(b) The dividend payout ratio for the first and second quarters of 2020 was impacted by lower EPS which was impacted by the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Dividends 

Consistent with our 2020 capital plan, we paid a quarterly dividend of $.185 per Common Share for the third quarter of 2020. The suspension of our share repurchase program announced on March 17, 2020, does not impact our dividend per Common Share, and we believe our capital level provides sufficient capacity to maintain our dividend (subject to any restrictions that may be imposed by the Federal Reserve, as discussed in &#8220;Capital planning and stress testing&#8221; in the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; section). Further information regarding the capital planning process and CCAR is included under the heading &#8220;Capital planning and stress testing&#8221; in the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; section beginning on page 15 of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Common shares outstanding 

Our Common Shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol KEY with 32,376 holders of record at September 30, 2020. Our book value per Common Share was $16.25 based on 976.2 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2020, compared to $15.54 per Common Share based on 977.2 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2019. At September 30, 2020, our tangible book value per Common Share was $13.32, compared to $12.56 per Common Share at December 31, 2019.

As shown above, Common Shares outstanding increased by .3 million shares during the third quarter of 2020. 

At September 30, 2020, we had 280.5 million treasury shares, compared to 279.5 million treasury shares at December 31, 2019. Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes. 

Information on repurchases of Common Shares by KeyCorp is included in Part II, Item 2. &#8220;Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds&#8221; of this report.

Capital adequacy 

Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of our capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at September 30, 2020. Our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse operating environment while continuing to serve our clients&#8217; needs, as well as to meet the Regulatory Capital Rules described in Item 1. Business of our 2019 Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Supervision and Regulation.&#8221; Our shareholders&#8217; equity to assets ratio was 10.4% at September 30, 2020, compared to 11.8% at December 31, 2019. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.8% at September 30, 2020, compared to 8.6% at December 31, 2019. See the section entitled &#8220;GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations,&#8221; which presents the computations of certain financial measures related to &#8220;tangible common equity.&#8221; The minimum capital and leverage ratios under the Regulatory Capital Rules together with the ratios of KeyCorp at September 30, 2020, are set forth in the &#8220;Supervision and regulation &#8212; Regulatory capital requirements&#8221; section in Item 2 of this report. 

Figure 20 represents the details of our regulatory capital positions at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, under the Regulatory Capital Rules. Information regarding the regulatory capital ratios of KeyCorp&#8217;s banking subsidiaries is presented annually, with the most recent information included in Note 24 (&#8220;Shareholders' Equity&#8221;) beginning on page 169 of our 2019 Form 10-K.

Risk Management 

Overview 

Like all financial services companies, we engage in business activities and assume the related risks. The most significant risks we face are credit, compliance, operational, liquidity, market, reputation, strategic, and model risks. Our risk management activities are focused on ensuring that we properly identify, measure, and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness, and to maximize profitability. There have been no significant changes in our Risk Management practices as described under the heading &#8220;Risk Management&#8221; beginning on page 65 of our 2019 Form 10-K. These Risk Management practices include heightened monitoring and risk evaluation activities in light of the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic. 

Market risk management 

Market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, and volatilities will reduce Key&#8217;s income and the value of its portfolios. These factors influence prospective yields, values, or prices associated with the instrument. We are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities, which include asset and liability management activities. Information regarding our fair value policies, procedures, and methodologies is provided in Note 1 (&#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; on page 104 of our 2019 Form 10-K and Note 5 (&#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221;) in this report. 

Trading market risk 

Key incurs market risk as a result of trading activities that are used in support of client facilitation and hedging activities, principally within our investment banking and capital markets businesses. Key has exposures to a wide range of risk factors including interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and commodity prices, as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads. Our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading and hedging activities in the derivative and fixed income markets, including securitization positions exposures. At September 30, 2020, we did not have any re-securitization positions. We maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow, make markets in securities, and hedge certain risks including but not limited to credit risk and interest rate risk. The risks associated with these activities are mitigated in accordance with the Market Risk hedging policy. The majority of our positions are traded in active markets. 

Market risk management is an integral part of Key&#8217;s risk culture. The Risk Committee of our Board provides oversight of trading market risks. The ERM Committee and the Market Risk Committee regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our MRM that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities. Market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the Market Risk Committee, a Tier 2 Risk Governance Committee, and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment. For more information regarding monitoring of trading positions and the activities related to the Market Risk Rule compliance, see &#8221;Market Risk Management&#8221; beginning on page 66 of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

VaR and stressed VaR. VaR is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level. Stressed VaR is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios. The MRM calculates VaR and stressed VaR on a daily basis, and the results are distributed to appropriate management. VaR and stressed VaR results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations. 

We use a historical simulation VaR model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other non-covered positions. We analyze market risk by portfolios and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type. VaR is calculated using daily observations over a one-year time horizon and approximates a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than VaR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter. We also calculate VaR and stressed VaR at a 99% confidence level. For more information regarding our VaR model, its governance and assumptions, see &#8221;Market Risk Management&#8221; on page 66 of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Actual losses for the total covered portfolios did not exceed the aggregate daily VaR at a 99% confidence level during the quarter ended September 30, 2020, and September 30, 2019. The MRM backtests our VaR model on a 

Table of contents 

daily basis to evaluate its predictive power. The test compares VaR model results at the 99% confidence level to daily held profit and loss. Results of backtesting are provided to the MRC. Backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed VaR. We do not engage in correlation trading or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk. Our net VaR approach incorporates diversification, but our VaR calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives. 

The aggregate VaR at the 99% confidence level with a one day holding period for all covered positions was $3.1 million at September 30, 2020, and $1.0 million at September 30, 2019. Figure 21 summarizes our VaR at the 99% confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended September 30, 2020, and September 30, 2019.

Stressed VaR is calculated by running the portfolios through a predetermined stress period which is approved by the MRC and is calculated at the 99% confidence level using the same model and assumptions used for general VaR. The aggregate stressed VaR for all covered positions was $3.1 million at September 30, 2020, and $4.5 million at September 30, 2019. Figure 22 summarizes our stressed VaR at the 99% confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended September 30, 2020, and September 30, 2019.

Internal capital adequacy assessment. Market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment. Our risk-weighted assets include a market risk-equivalent asset amount, which consists of a VaR component, stressed VaR component, a de minimis exposure amount, and a specific risk add-on including the securitization positions. The aggregate market value of the securitization positions as defined by the Market Risk Rule was $27 million at September 30, 2020, all of which were mortgage-backed security positions. Specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments, which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach. Market risk weighted assets, including the specific risk calculations, are run quarterly by the MRM in accordance with the Market Risk Rule, and approved by the Chief Market Risk Officer. 

Nontrading market risk 

Most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products, as well as investments, hedging relationships, long-term debt, and certain short-term borrowings. Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the EVE that result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of assets and liabilities. We manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the EVE in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the Board approved ERM policy. 

Interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors, including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, changes in market interest rates that affect client activity, and our hedging, investing, funding, and capital positions. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk, basis risk, yield curve risk, and option risk. 

Table of contents 

&#8226; &#8220;Reprice risk&#8221; is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest-bearing liabilities and the volume of interest-earning assets they fund (e.g., deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time. 

&#8226; &#8220;Basis risk&#8221; is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indices and occurs when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indexes. 

&#8226; &#8220;Yield curve risk&#8221; is the exposure to nonparallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) and occurs when interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve. 

&#8226; &#8220;Option risk&#8221; is the exposure to a customer or counterparty&#8217;s ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets, liabilities, or off-balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty. Option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation. 

The management of nontrading market risk is centralized within Corporate Treasury. The Risk Committee of our Board provides oversight of nontrading market risk. The ERM Committee and the ALCO review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above. In addition, the ALCO reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk. The ERM Committee and the ALCO have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk, including recommending, approving, and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges. The A/LM policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the ALCO. The MRM, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight. 

LIBOR Transition 

As disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2019 Form 10-K, LIBOR in its current form is not expected to be available after 2021. The most likely replacement rate is expected to be SOFR, which has been recommended by the ARRC. The Federal Reserve has encouraged financial institutions not to wait for the end of 2021 to make the transition away from LIBOR. We have established an enterprise wide program to identify and address all LIBOR transition issues. We are collaborating closely with regulators and industry groups on the transition and closely monitoring developments in industry practices related to LIBOR alternatives. The goals of our LIBOR transition program are to: 

&#8226; Identify and analyze LIBOR-based exposure and develop and execute transition strategies;

As part of the LIBOR transition program, we completed an initial risk assessment to help us identify the impact and risks associated with various products, systems, processes, and models. This risk assessment has assisted us in making necessary updates to our infrastructure and operational systems and processes to implement a replacement rate, and we anticipate being operationally ready for SOFR in the fourth quarter of 2020. We have compiled an inventory of existing legal contracts that are impacted by the LIBOR transition. We are assessing the LIBOR fallback language in those contracts and are devising a strategy to address the LIBOR transition for those contracts. We have also focused on refining LIBOR fallback language in new legal contracts. We expect to leverage recommendations made by the ARRC and ISDA that are tailored to our specific client segments. 

Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. The analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view. The modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with management's desired interest rate risk positioning. The simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if rates were to gradually increase or decrease from current levels over the next 12 months (subject to a floor on market interest rates at zero). 

Table of contents 

Figure 23 presents the results of the simulation analysis at September 30, 2020, and September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2020, our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was modest. Exposure to declining rates remains nominal given the low level of market rates in comparison to the floor utilized in the scenario. Exposure to rising rates has changed from a detriment in 2019 to a benefit currently as the lower actual market rates reduce the need for additional modeled hedges and lower the projected beta to rising rates. Tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual, parallel 200 basis point increase or 200 basis point decrease in interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 5.5%. Current modeled exposure is within Board approved tolerances.

Simulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions input into the model. We tailor certain assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. However, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, changes in management&#8217;s desired interest rate risk positioning, investment, funding and hedging activities, and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events. 

We also perform regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. Assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve, including steepening or flattening of the yield curve, immediate changes in market interest rates, and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions: loan and deposit balances, the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, investment, funding and hedging activities, and liquidity and capital management strategies. 

The results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in Figure 23. Net interest income is highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency, and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships, lending spreads, and the balance behavior of transaction accounts. If fixed rate assets increase by $1 billion, or fixed rate liabilities decrease by $1 billion, then the benefit to rising rates would decrease by approximately 25 basis points. If the interest-bearing liquid deposit beta assumption increases or decreases by 5% (e.g., 40% to 45%), then the benefit to rising rates would decrease or increase by approximately 95 basis points. 

Our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity, and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows. Corporate Treasury discretionary activities related to funding, investing, and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows or changes in management&#8217;s desired interest rate risk positioning. As changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile. 

We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes of the EVE as discussed in the following section. 

Economic value of equity modeling. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12-, 24-, and 36-month horizons. EVE modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, measuring the resulting change in the values of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments, and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. Those assumptions 

Table of contents 

are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. We develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these guidelines as of September 30, 2020. 

Management of interest rate exposure. We use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate A/LM strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. Specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives. We predominantly use interest rate swaps and options, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities. 

Figure 24 shows all swap positions that we hold for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a &#8220;receive fixed/pay variable&#8221; interest rate swap. The volume, maturity, and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile, see Note 7 (&#8220;Derivatives and Hedging Activities&#8221;).

Liquidity risk management 

Liquidity risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences. Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions. 

Factors affecting liquidity 

Our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, global pandemics (including COVID-19), political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund, or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general, may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our First Quarter 2020 Form 10-Q for a discussion of how the COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted our liquidity and may continue to impact it in the future. 

Our credit ratings at September 30, 2020, are shown in Figure 25. We believe these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, would enable KeyCorp or KeyBank to issue fixed income securities to investors.

Sources of liquidity 

Our primary source of funding for KeyBank is retail and commercial deposits. As of September 30, 2020, our consolidated loan-to-deposit ratio was 77%. In addition, we also have access to various sources of wholesale funding, maintain a portfolio of liquid assets, and have borrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. Our liquid asset portfolio at September 30, 2020, totaled $36.9 billion, consisting of $23.9 billion of unpledged securities, $80 million of securities available for secured funding at the FHLB, and $12.9 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our Federal Reserve account. Additionally, as of September 30, 2020, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $24.4 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $8.6 billion at the FHLB. During the third quarter of 2020, our secured term borrowings decreased $1.0 billion as advances were paid down. 

Liquidity for KeyCorp 

The primary source of liquidity for KeyCorp is from subsidiary dividends, primarily from KeyBank. KeyCorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt, support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions), support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries&#8217; obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences, and pay dividends to shareholders. 

At September 30, 2020, KeyCorp held $3.8 billion in cash, which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations, including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance. 

Typically, KeyCorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank. During the third quarter of 2020, KeyBank paid $350 million in cash dividends to KeyCorp. As of September 30, 2020, KeyBank had regulatory capacity to pay $823 million in dividends to KeyCorp without prior regulatory approval. 

Our liquidity position and recent activity 

Over the past quarter, our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios, has increased as a result of an increase in cash held at the Federal Reserve, which was partially offset by a decrease in unpledged securities. The liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longer-term solution. 

The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020, and September 30, 2019. 

For more information regarding liquidity governance structure, factors affecting liquidity, management of liquidity risk at KeyBank and KeyCorp, long-term liquidity strategies, and other liquidity programs, see &#8221;Liquidity Risk Management&#8221; beginning on page 71 of our 2019 Form 10-K.

Credit risk management 

Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from an obligor&#8217;s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities, provide financial and payments products, and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk. 

Credit policy, approval, and evaluation 

We manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. The Credit Risk Committee approves management&#8217;s credit policies and recommends for approval significant credit policies to the appropriate Board committee or to the Board. These policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit. As a result of the current economic environment, our commercial loan portfolio is going through active portfolio surveillance which is described in more detail in the section entitled &#8220;Loans and loans held for sale &#8212; Commercial loan portfolio.&#8221; 

Allowance for loan and lease losses 

We estimate the appropriate level of the ALLL on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology used is described in Note 1 (&#8220;Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies&#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses&#8221; in this report. Briefly, the ALLL estimate uses various models and estimation techniques based on our historical loss experience, current borrower characteristics, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts and other relevant factors. The ALLL at September 30, 2020, represents our best estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date. 

As shown in Figure 26, our ALLL from continuing operations increased by $830 million, or 92.2%, from December 31, 2019. Our commercial ALLL decreased by $124 million, or 16.5%, with the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments &#8212; Credit Losses at January 1, 2020. The commercial ALLL increased by $554 million, or 88.4%, from January 1, 2020, through September 30, 2020, driven by updated economic forecasts that capture additional deterioration triggered by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Our consumer ALLL increased by $328 million, or 220.1%, with the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments &#8212; Credit Losses at January 1, 2020. The consumer ALLL increased $72 million, or 15.1%, from January 1, 2020, through September 30, 2020, driven by portfolio growth and updated economic forecasts that capture additional deterioration triggered by the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Net loan charge-offs 

Figure 27 shows the trend in our net loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in Figure 28. 

Net loan charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2020, decreased $68 million compared to the year-ago quarter. This decrease was primarily due to a $123 million charge-off related to a previously disclosed fraud loss in the third quarter of 2019.

Nonperforming assets 

Figure 29 shows the composition of our nonperforming assets. As shown in Figure 29, nonperforming assets at September 30, 2020, increased $288 million from December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in nonperforming loans in our oil and gas portfolio and the transfer of one commercial property to OREO in the first quarter of 2020. 

Under the CARES Act as well as banking regulator interagency guidance, certain loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial distress as a result of the economic impacts created by the COVID-19 pandemic may not be reported as nonperforming. Refer to Note 4 (&#8220;Asset Quality&#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Nonperforming and Past Due Loans.&#8221;

Operational and compliance risk management 

Like all businesses, we are subject to operational risk, which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. These events include, among other things, threats to our cybersecurity, as we are reliant upon information systems and the Internet to conduct our business activities. Operational risk also encompasses compliance risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices, and ethical standards. This includes our compliance with lending programs established by the CARES Act, including the PPP and Main Street Lending Program. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, large financial companies like Key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation. This heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk. Resulting operational risk losses and/or additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation, or foregone opportunities. 

We seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, and a system of internal controls and reporting. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and regulations. For example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. We also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the Board. 

The Operational Risk Management Program provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles, and responsibilities, as well as the content, to manage operational risk for Key. The Compliance Risk Management Program serves the same function in managing compliance risk for Key. The Operational Risk Committee and the Compliance Risk Committee support the ERM Committee by identifying early warning events and trends, escalating emerging risks, and discussing forward-looking assessments. Both the Operational Risk Committee and the Compliance Risk Committee include attendees from each of the Three Lines of Defense. Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. The Operational Risk Committee and Compliance Risk Committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities. These committees and the Operational Risk Management and Compliance Risk Management functions are an integral part of our ERM Program. Our Risk Review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our Operational Risk Management and Compliance Risk Management Programs and our system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior 

management and the Risk and Audit Committees and independently supports the Risk Committee&#8217;s oversight of these controls. 

See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our First Quarter 2020 Form 10-Q for a discussion of additional operational risks stemming from the COVID-19 global pandemic. 

Cybersecurity 

We maintain comprehensive Cyber Incident Response Plans, and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems, shut down access to systems for ransom, or cause other damage. As the threat landscape continues to evolve, critical infrastructure, including financial services, remains a top target for cyberattacks. The emergence of COVID-19 has created a unique situation globally with many more employees and third-party service providers working from home, which inherently introduces additional risk. Cyberattacks may include, but are not limited to, attacks that are intended to disrupt or disable banking services and prevent banking transactions, attempts to breach the security of systems and data, and social engineering attempts aimed at tricking employees and clients into providing sensitive information or executing financial transactions. 

Cyberattack risks may also occur with our third-party technology service providers and may result in financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Cyberattacks could also interfere with third-party providers&#8217; ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. Recent high-profile cyberattacks have 

Table of contents 

targeted retailers, credit bureaus, and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information (including personal, financial, and credit card information) of customers, some of whom are customers of ours. We may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks. We may also incur expenses to enhance our systems or processes to protect against cyber or other security incidents. Risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking, and other technology-based products and services by us and our clients. To date, Key has not experienced material disruption of our operations, or material harm to our customers, as a result of the heightened threat landscape or cyberattacks. 

See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our First Quarter 2020 Form 10-Q for a discussion of additional cybersecurity risks stemming from the COVID-19 global pandemic. 

As described in more detail starting on page 65 of our 2019 Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Management &#8212; Overview,&#8221; the Board serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that Key&#8217;s risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders. The Board&#8217;s Risk Committee has primary oversight for enterprise-wide risk at KeyCorp, including operational risk (which includes cybersecurity). The Risk Committee reviews and provides oversight of management&#8217;s activities related to the enterprise-wide risk management framework, including cyber-related risk. The ERM Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and comprising other senior level executives, is responsible for managing risk (including cyber-related risk) and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The ERM Committee reports to the Board&#8217;s Risk Committee. 

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations 

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not 

audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, 

they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, nor as a substitute for analyses 

of results as reported under GAAP. 

The tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some 

investors, and management believes that these ratios may assist investors in analyzing Key&#8217;s capital position 

without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Since analysts and banking regulators may 

assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our 

capital adequacy on these same bases.

The cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-GAAP performance measures, adjusted noninterest expense and total taxable-equivalent revenue. Accordingly, there is no directly comparable GAAP performance measure. The cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation. We believe this ratio provides greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks. Additionally, this ratio is used by analysts and investors to evaluate how effectively management is controlling noninterest expenses in generating revenue, as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. These choices are critical &#8211; not only are they necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 (&#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221;) beginning on page 100 of our 2019 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance. Note 1 (&#8220;Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies&#8221;) of this report should also be reviewed for more information on accounting standards that have been adopted during the period. 

In our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them. 

We rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions, and estimates to make a number of core decisions, including accounting for the ALLL; contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes; derivatives and related hedging activities; and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies. In addition, we may employ outside valuation experts to assist us in determining fair values of certain assets and liabilities. A brief discussion of each of these areas appears on pages 84 through 87 of our 2019 Form 10-K. During the first nine months of 2020, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates except for our ALLL as a result of the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020. 

In conjunction with the adoption of ASC 326, the critical accounting policy and estimate disclosure for our ALLL was updated from what was disclosed in our 2019 Form 10-K. The accounting policy for goodwill was also updated due to the adoption of ASU 2017-04, &#8220;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.&#8221; These updates are as follows: 

Allowance for loan and lease losses 

The allowance for loans and leases represents management&#8217;s estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our existing loan portfolio. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These critical estimates include significant use of our own historical data and complex methods to interpret them. We have an ongoing process to evaluate and enhance the quality, quantity, and timeliness of our data and interpretation methods used in the determination of these allowances. These evaluations are inherently subjective, as they require material estimates and may be susceptible to significant change, and include, among others: 

&#8226; PD, 

&#8226; LGD, 

&#8226; Outstanding balance of the loan, 

&#8226; Movement through delinquency stages, 

Table of contents 

&#8226; Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, 

&#8226; Value of collateral, which may be obtained from third parties, 

&#8226; Economic forecasts which are obtained from a third party provider, and 

&#8226; Qualitative factors, such as changes in current economic conditions, that may not be reflected in modeled results. 

As described in our accounting policy related to the ALLL in Note 1 (&#8220;Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies&#8221;) of this report under the heading &#8220;Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses," we employ a disciplined process and methodology to establish our ALLL, which has three main components: (i) asset specific / individual loan reserves; (ii) quantitative (formulaic or pooled) reserves; and (iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. 

We use a non-DCF factor-based approach to estimate expected credit losses that include component PD/LGD/EAD models as well as less complex estimation methods for smaller loan portfolios. Probability of default models estimate the likelihood a borrower will cease making payments as agreed. These models use observed loan-level information and projected paths of macroeconomic variables. Borrower credit attributes including FICO scores of consumers and internally assigned risk ratings for commercial borrowers are significant inputs to the models. Consumer FICO scores are refreshed quarterly and commercial risk ratings are updated annually with select borrowers updated more frequently. The macroeconomic trends that have a significant impact on the probability of default vary by portfolio segment. Exposure at default models estimate the loan balance at the time the borrower stops making payments. We use an amortization based formulaic approach to estimate account level EAD for all term loans. We use portfolio specific methods in each of our revolving product portfolios. LGD models estimate the loss we will suffer once a loan is in default. Account level inputs to LGD models include collateral attributes, such as loan to value. 

If we observe limitations in the data or models, we use model overlays to make adjustments to model outputs to capture a particular risk or compensate for a known limitation. These variables and others may result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts. 

This estimate produced by our models is forward-looking and requires management to use forecasts about future economic conditions to determine the expected credit loss over the remaining life of an instrument. Moody&#8217;s Consensus forecast is the source of macroeconomic projections, including the interest rate forecasts used in the credit models. We use a two year reasonable and supportable period across all products to forecast economic conditions. As the length of the life of a financial asset increases, these inputs may become impractical to estimate as reasonable and supportable. We believe the two year time horizon appropriately aligns with our business planning, available industry guidance, and reliability of various forecasting services. Following this two year period in which supportable forecasts can be generated, for all modeled loan portfolios, we revert expected credit losses to a level that is consistent with our historical information by reverting the macroeconomic variables (model inputs) to their long run average. We revert to historical loss rates for less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios. A four quarter reversion period is used where the macroeconomic variables linearly revert to their long run average following the two year reasonable and supportable period. We use a 20 year lookback period for determining long run historical average of the macroeconomic variables. We determined the 20 year lookback period is appropriate as it captures the previous two economic cycles including the last downturn and our more recent positive credit experience. 

The ALLL is sensitive to various macroeconomic drivers such as GDP and unemployment as well as portfolio attributes such as remaining term, outstanding balance, risk ratings, FICO, LTV, and delinquency status. Our ALLL models were designed to capture the correlation between economic and portfolio changes. As such, evaluating shifts in individual portfolio attributes and macroeconomic variables in isolation may not be indicative of past or future performance. 

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall ALLL because we consider a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the ALLL. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and input may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. However, to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate economic forecast, we compared the modeled quantitative allowance results using a downside economic scenario. The maximum difference in the quarterly macroeconomic variables between the base and downside scenarios over the two year reasonable and supportable period includes an approximate 11% decline in GDP annualized growth and an approximate 5% increase in the U.S. 

Table of contents 

unemployment rate . The difference between these two scenarios would have driven an increase of approximately 1.8x for commercial and 1.4x for the consumer modeled allowance results. 

Similarly, deteriorating conditions for portfolio factors were also considered by moderately stressing key portfolio drivers, relative to the baseline portfolio conditions. Stressing risk ratings by two grades for commercial loans generates a 1.4x increase in the commercial modeled allowance results. Stressing FICO by ten points, and LTV and utilization by 10% for consumer loans generates a 1.2x increase in the consumer modeled allowance results. 

Note that these analyses demonstrate the sensitivity of the ALLL to key quantitative assumptions; however, they are not intended to estimate changes in the overall ALLL as they do not reflect qualitative factors related to idiosyncratic risk factors, changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results, and other relevant factors that must be considered to ensure the ALLL reflects our best estimate of current expected credit losses. With the unprecedented economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, future ALLL results may vary considerably based on the actual magnitude of the pandemic and impact of the United States' monetary and fiscal response. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment for all three of our reporting units: Consumer Bank, Commercial Bank and Institutional Bank. We perform our annual impairment test as of October 1st and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing is needed. 

Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2017-04, &#8220;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,&#8221; eliminating the second step of goodwill impairment testing. Under the new guidance, if the fair value of a reporting unit declines below its carrying value, an impairment charge will be recognized for any amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value, to the extent that the loss recognized does not exceed the amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The adoption of ASU 2017-04 did not impact our current financial condition or results of operations. 

In consideration of the deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and industry and market conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic during the third quarter of 2020, we identified a triggering event. Impairment indicators considered comprised economic conditions, including projections of the duration of current conditions and timing of a potential recovery; industry and market considerations; government intervention and regulatory updates; the impact of recent events to financial performance and cost factors of the reporting units; performance of our stock; and other relevant events. 

After considering the triggering event together with other relevant factors, we performed an interim quantitative test at each reporting unit. We concluded goodwill was not impaired at September 30, 2020. For more information, see Note 10 (&#8220;Goodwill&#8221;) .

Accounting and Reporting Developments 

Accounting Guidance Pending Adoption at September 30, 2020 

Standard Required Adoption Description Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes January 1, 2021 Early adoption is permitted This ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the existing guidance, such as exceptions related to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment and when a foreign equity method investment becomes a subsidiary. Along with general improvements, it adds simplifications related to franchise taxes, the tax basis of goodwill, and the method for recognizing an enacted change in tax laws. The guidance also specifies that an entity is not required to allocate the consolidated amount of certain tax expense to a legal entity not subject to tax in its own separate financial statements. The guidance should be applied on either a retrospective, modified retrospective, or prospective basis depending on the amendment. The adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. ASU 2020-01, Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321,Investments &#8212;Equity Securities; Topic 323, Investments&#8212; Equity Method and Joint Ventures; and Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging January 1, 2021 Early adoption is permitted This guidance clarifies that when applying the measurement alternative in Topic 321, companies should consider certain observable transactions that require the application or discontinuance of the equity method under Topic 323. It also clarifies that companies should not consider whether the underlying securities in certain forward contracts and purchased options would be accounted for under the equity method or fair value option when determining the method of accounting for those contracts. This guidance should be applied on a prospective basis. The adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. ASU 2020-06, Debt&#8212;Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging&#8212; Contracts in Entity&#8217;s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) January 1, 2022 Early adoption is permitted. The ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments by eliminating the legacy accounting models for convertible instruments with beneficial conversion features or cash conversion features. The guidance also amends the guidance used to determine if a freestanding financial instrument or an embedded feature qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting. For freestanding financial instruments and embedded features that have all the characteristics of a derivative instrument and are potentially settled in an entity&#8217;s own stock, the guidance simplifies the settlement assessment that entities are required to perform. Also, the Update now requires the use of the if-converted method for all convertible instruments and includes the effect of potential share settlement in diluted EPS if the effect is more dilutive. The new guidance also makes clarifications to the EPS calculation. Further, the ASU expands disclosure requirements. The guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective or retrospective basis. The adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

ASU 2020-08, 

Codification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20, 

Receivables&#8212;Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs 

January 1, 2021 Early adoption is not permitted. 

This ASU clarifies that at each reporting period an entity should reevaluate whether a callable debt security is within the scope of ASC 310, which says that to the extent the amortized cost basis of an individual callable debt security exceeds the amount repayable by the issuer at the earliest call date, the premium shall be amortized to the earliest call date, unless prepayment guidance is applied. 

This guidance should be applied on a prospective basis. 

The adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of KeyCorp and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Some previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to current reporting practices. 

The consolidated financial statements include any voting rights entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations, we consolidate a VIE if we have: (i) a variable interest in the entity; (ii) the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the entity&#8217;s economic performance; and (iii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE (i.e., we are considered to be the primary beneficiary). Variable interests can include equity interests, subordinated debt, derivative contracts, leases, service agreements, guarantees, standby letters of credit, loan commitments, and other contracts, agreements, and financial instruments. See Note 11 (&#8220;Variable Interest Entities&#8221;) for information on our involvement with VIEs. 

We use the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or VIEs if we have significant influence over the entity&#8217;s operating and financing decisions (usually defined as a voting or economic interest of 20% to 50%, but not controlling). Unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or VIEs in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than 20% are carried at the cost measurement alternative or at fair value. Investments held by our registered broker-dealer and investment company subsidiaries (principal investing entities and Real Estate Capital line of business) are carried at fair value. 

We believe that the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature and disclosures that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year. The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

In preparing these financial statements, subsequent events were evaluated through the time the financial statements were issued. Financial statements are considered issued when they are widely distributed to all shareholders and other financial statement users or filed with the SEC. 

Effective July 1, 2020, Key amended its Accounting Policy for presentation of Short-Term Investments (page 104 of our 2019 Form 10-K) to include United States Treasury Bills with an original maturity of three months or less. 

Accounting Guidance Adopted in 2020 

Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13, ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-11, ASU 2020-02, ASU 2020-03) 

On January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13 , Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the incurred-loss methodology that recognized losses when a probable threshold was met with an expected-loss methodology, specifically, recognizing current expected credit losses (CECL) for the remaining life of the asset at the time of origination or acquisition. The CECL methodology applies to loans, debt securities, and other financial assets and net investment in leases measured at amortized cost. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments). Assets in the scope of ASC 326 are presented at the net amount expected to be collected after deducting the allowance for credit losses from the amortized cost basis of the assets. 

ASC 326 also requires credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities that management does not intend to sell or believes that it is more likely than not they will be required to sell to be recorded through an allowance rather than a reduction of the carrying amount. 

ASC 326 replaces the purchased credit impaired concept of accounting, previously required under Subtopic 310-30, with a purchased financial assets with credit deterioration (PCD) concept. In accordance with ASC 326, we did not reassess whether recognized purchased credit impaired loans met the criteria of a PCD loan and modifications to individual acquired loans accounted for in pools were TDRs as of the date of adoption. At adoption, we elected to not maintain the pools of loans previously accounted for under Subtopic 310-30. 

Table of contents 

The prospective application resulted in a $ 4 million adjustment to the amortized cost basis of PCD loans to reflect the addition to the allowance for loans and leases as of January 1, 2020. After the adjustment for the allowance for the loans and leases, the noncredit discount of $ 15 million will be accreted to interest income using the interest method based on the effective interest rate determined after the adjustment from credit losses as of January 1, 2020. 

The ASU requires use of a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020, are presented under ASC 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. We posted an adjusting entry decreasing retained earnings as of January 1, 2020, by $ 230 million, net of deferred taxes of $ 71 million, for the cumulative effect of adopting ASC 326. The main drivers of the adjustment to retained earnings are summarized in the following table.

In conjunction with the adoption of ASC 326, the following are additional disclosures about our significant accounting policies related to CECL. 

Allowance for Held-to-Maturity Securities 

Debt securities that we have the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at cost and adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the interest method. This method produces a constant rate of return on the adjusted carrying amount. 

Management classifies the held-to-maturity portfolio into the following major security types: agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations, agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset backed securities, and other. Management measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity securities on a collective basis by major security type. The estimate of expected losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. We do not measure expected credit losses on held-to-maturity securities in which historical credit loss information adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts results in an expectation that nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero. 

All of our mortgage-backed securities are issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA, are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. Other securities are comprised of State of Israel bonds denominated and paid in U.S. dollars. Israel bonds have a long history of no credit losses. Additionally, as of September 30, 2020, the State of Israel's credit rating remains "stable" among Fitch, Moody's, and S&#38;P (A+, A1, AA-). 

Table of contents 

Allowance for Available-for-Sale Securities 

Debt securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time but that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment risk, liquidity needs, or other factors are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. Realized gains and losses resulting from sales of securities using the specific identification method are included in &#8220;other income&#8221; on the income statement. Unrealized gains and losses (net of income taxes) are recorded in equity as a component of AOCI. 

For available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether we intend to sell, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value in &#8220;other income&#8221; on the income statement. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, nature of the security, the underlying collateral, and the financial condition of the issuer, among other factors. If this assessment indicates a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for available-for-sale securities is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for available-for-sale securities is recognized in other comprehensive income. 

Changes in the allowance for available-for-sale securities are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss. Losses are charged against the allowance for available-for-sale securities when management believes the uncollectibility of an available-for-sale security is confirmed or when either criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. 

Loans 

Accrued interest on loans is included in "other assets" on the balance sheet and is excluded from the calculation of the allowance for credit losses due to our charge-off policy to reverse accrued interest on nonperforming loans against interest income in a timely manner. We have not classified loans that receive a payment deferral or forbearance under a COVID-19 hardship relief program as nonperforming loans and continue to accrue and recognize interest income during the period of the deferral. We, therefore, recognize an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable amounts that result from deferred payments under a COVID-19 hardship relief program because those amounts would not be considered to be written off in a timely manner. As of September 30, 2020, the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable was immaterial. 

Expected credit losses on net investments in leases, including any unguaranteed residual asset, are included in the ALLL. 

Purchased Credit Deteriorated (PCD) Loans 

In addition to originating loans, we also acquire loans through portfolio purchases or acquisitions of other financial services companies. Purchased loans that have evidence of more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are deemed PCD loans. In accordance with ASC 326, we did not reassess whether recognized purchased credit impaired loans met the criteria of a PCD loan as of the date of adoption. PCD loans are initially recorded at fair value along with an allowance for credit losses determined using the same methodology as originated loans. The sum of the loan's purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through provision for credit losses. 

Nonperforming Loans 

Nonperforming loans are loans for which we do not accrue interest income, and include commercial and consumer loans and leases, as well as current year TDRs and nonaccruing TDR loans from prior years. Nonperforming loans do not include loans held for sale. Once a loan is designated nonaccrual, the interest accrued but not collected is 

Table of contents 

reversed against interest income, and payments subsequently received are applied to principal until qualifying for return to accrual. 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 

We estimate the ALLL using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The ALLL is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Our portfolio segments include commercial and consumer. Each of these two segments comprises multiple loan classes. Classes are characterized by similarities in initial measurement, risk attributes, and the manner in which we monitor and assess credit risk. The commercial segment is composed of commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, and commercial lease financing loan classes. The consumer lending segment is composed of residential mortgage, home equity, consumer direct, credit card, and consumer indirect loan classes. 

The ALLL represents our current estimate of lifetime credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. In determining the ALLL, we estimate expected future losses for the loan's entire contractual term adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications. 

The ALLL is the sum of three components: (i) asset specific/ individual loan reserves; (ii) quantitative (formulaic or pooled) reserves; and (iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. 

Asset Specific / Individual Component 

Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not included in the collective evaluation. We have elected to apply the practical expedient to measure expected credit losses of a collateral dependent asset using the fair value of the collateral, less any costs to sell, when foreclosure is not probable, when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. 

Individual reserves are determined as follows: 

&#8226; For commercial non-accruing loans greater than or equal to a defined dollar threshold, individual reserves are determined based on an analysis of the present value of the loan's expected future cash flows, the loan's observable market value, or the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. 

&#8226; For commercial non-accruing loans below the defined dollar threshold, an established LGD percentage is multiplied by the loan balance and the results are aggregated for purposes of measuring specific reserve impairment. 

&#8226; The population of individually assessed consumer loans includes loans deemed collateral dependent, in addition to all TDRs. The expected loss for these loans is estimated based on the present value of the loan's expected future cash flows, except in instances where the loan is collateral dependent, in which case the loan is written down based on the collateral's fair market value less costs to sell. 

Quantitative Component 

We use a non-DCF factor-based approach to estimate expected credit losses that include component PD/LGD/EAD models as well as less complex estimation methods for smaller loan portfolios. 

&#8226; PD: This component model is used to estimate the likelihood that a borrower will cease making payments as agreed. The major contributors to this are the borrower credit attributes and macro-economic trends. The objective of the PD model is to produce default likelihood forecasts based on the observed loan-level information and projected paths of macroeconomic variables. 

&#8226; LGD: This component model is used to estimate the loss on a loan once a loan is in default. 

&#8226; EAD: Estimates the loan balance at the time the borrower stops making payments. For all term loans, an amortization based formulaic approach is used for account level EAD estimates. We calculate EAD using a portfolio specific method in each of our revolving product portfolios. For line products that are unconditionally cancellable, the balances will either use a paydown curve or be held flat through the life of the loan. 

Additional information about the critical estimates and judgments we make in developing these models is provided in the section &#8220;Allowance for loan and lease losses&#8221; under the heading &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#8221; in Item 2 of this report. 

Table of contents 

Qualitative Component 

The ALLL also includes identified qualitative factors related to idiosyncratic risk factors, changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results, and other relevant factors to ensure the ALLL reflects our best estimate of current expected credit losses. 

While our reserve methodologies strive to reflect all relevant risk factors, there continues to be uncertainty associated with, but not limited to, potential imprecision in the estimation process due to the inherent time lag 

of obtaining information and normal variations between estimates and actual outcomes. We provide additional reserves that are designed to provide coverage for losses attributable to such risks. The ALLL also includes factors that may not be directly measured in the determination of individual or collective reserves. Such qualitative factors may include: 

&#8226; The nature and volume of the institution&#8217;s financial assets; 

&#8226; The existence, growth, and effect of any concentrations of credit; 

&#8226; The volume and severity of past due financial assets, the volume of nonaccrual assets, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded assets; 

&#8226; The value of the underlying collateral for loans that are not collateral dependent; 

&#8226; The institution&#8217;s lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and practices for collections, write-offs, and recoveries; 

&#8226; The quality of the institution&#8217;s credit review function; 

&#8226; The experience, ability, and depth of the institution&#8217;s lending, investment, collection, and other relevant management and staff; 

&#8226; The effect of other external factors such as the regulatory, legal and technological environments; competition; and events such as natural disasters; and 

&#8226; Actual and expected changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments in which the institution operates that affect the collectability of financial assets. 

Liability for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments 

The liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments, such as letters of credit and unfunded loan commitments, is included in &#8220;accrued expense and other liabilities&#8221; on the balance sheet. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual period in which we are exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by us. The liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments is adjusted as a provision for credit losses. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated useful life. Consistent with our estimation process on our loan and lease portfolio, we use a non-DCF factor-based approach to estimate expected credit losses that include component PD/LGD/EAD models as well as less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Other Financial Assets 

The allowance for credit losses on other financial assets, such as other receivables and servicing advances, is determined based on historical loss information and other available indicators. If such information does not indicate any expected credit losses, Key may estimate the allowance for credit losses on other financial assets to be zero or close to zero. As of September 30, 2020, the allowance for credit losses on other financial assets was immaterial. 

Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (ASU 2017-04) 

On January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2017-04. The ASU amends ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other and eliminates the second step of the test for goodwill impairment. Goodwill represents the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their f air value. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units as of the acquisition date based on the expected benefit to such reporting unit from the synergies of the business combination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level for impairment, at least annually as of October 1, or when indicators of impairment exist. 

Table of contents 

When indicators of impairment exist we may look to both quantitative and qualitative information to determine whether or not it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Factors considered in the assessment include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, stock performance, financial performance of the reporting units, and previous results of goodwill impairment tests. When it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount a quantitative test is required. Under the new accounting guidance, the quantitative analysis requires the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The adoption of this accounting guidance must be applied prospectively and is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See Note 10 (&#8220;Goodwill&#8221;) for results of our interim goodwill impairment test. 

Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) 

We adopted ASU 2020-04 on April 1, 2020. The amendments provide optional expedients and exceptions for certain contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of rate reform. The guidance is effective from the date of issuance until December 31, 2022. The guidance permits Key not to apply modification accounting or remeasure lease payments in lease contracts if the changes to the contract are related to the discontinuation of the reference rate. If certain criteria are met, the amendments also allow exceptions to the dedesignation criteria of the hedging relationship and the assessment of hedge effectiveness during the transition period. It also allows Key to make a one time election to sell, transfer, or both sell and transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform and that are classified as held to maturity before January 1, 2020. This one time election may be made at any time after March 12, 2020, but no later than December 31, 2022. Key has not made a determination on whether it will make this election. At the time of adoption, the guidance did not have a significant impact on Key&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. We will continue to assess the impact as the reference rate transition occurs over the next two years.

Basic earnings per share is the amount of earnings (adjusted for dividends declared on our preferred stock) available to each Common Share outstanding during the reporting periods. Diluted earnings per share is the amount of earnings available to each Common Share outstanding during the reporting periods adjusted to include the effects of potentially dilutive Common Shares. Potentially dilutive Common Shares include stock options and other stock-based awards. Potentially dilutive Common Shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in the periods where the effect would be antidilutive. 

Our basic and diluted earnings per Common Share are calculated as follows:

As described in Note 1 ("Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies"), we estimate the ALLL using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In our estimation of expected credit losses, we use a two year reasonable and supportable period across all products. Following this two year period in which supportable forecasts can be generated, for all modeled loan portfolios, we revert expected credit losses to a level that is consistent with our historical information by reverting the macroeconomic variables (model inputs) to their long run average. We revert to historical loss rates for less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios. A 20 year fixed length look back period is used to calculate the long run average of the macroeconomic variables. A four quarter reversion period is used where the macroeconomic variables linearly revert to their long run average following the two year reasonable and supportable period. 

We develop our reasonable and supportable forecasts using relevant data including, but not limited to, changes in economic output, unemployment rates, property values, and other factors associated with the credit losses on financial assets. Some macroeconomic variables apply to all portfolio segments, while others are more portfolio specific. The following table discloses key macroeconomic variables for each loan portfolio. 

Table of contents 

Segment Portfolio 

Key Macroeconomic Variables (a) 

Commercial Commercial and industrial BBB corporate bond rate (spread), GDP, industrial production, and unemployment rate Commercial real estate BBB corporate bond rate (spread), property and real estate price indices, and unemployment rate Commercial lease financing BBB corporate bond rate (spread), GDP, and unemployment rate Consumer Real estate &#8212; residential mortgage GDP, home price index, unemployment rate, and 30 year mortgage rate Home equity Home price index, unemployment rate, and 30 year mortgage rate Consumer direct Unemployment rate and U.S. household income Consumer indirect New vehicle sales and unemployment rate Credit cards Unemployment rate and U.S. household income Discontinued operations Unemployment rate 

(a) Variables include all transformations and interactions with other risk drivers. Additionally, variables may have varying impacts at different points in the economic cycle. 

In addition to macroeconomic drivers, portfolio attributes such as remaining term, outstanding balance, risk ratings, FICO, LTV, and delinquency also drive ALLL changes. Our ALLL models were designed to capture the correlation between economic and portfolio changes. As such, evaluating shifts in individual portfolio attributes and macroeconomic variables in isolation may not be indicative of past or future performance. 

Economic Outlook 

As of September 30, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to create unprecedented economic stress and uncertainty in the U.S. and globally. We utilized the Moody&#8217;s August 2020 Consensus forecast to estimate our expected credit losses as of September 30, 2020. This forecast considered the global economic fallout from the ongoing pandemic as well as the potential United States' monetary and fiscal response. We determined such forecast to be a reasonable view of the outlook for the global economy given the available information at current quarter end. 

The baseline scenario reflects a moderate economic slowdown over the next two years in markets in which we operate. U.S. GDP rebounds with a 20% annualized growth rate in the third quarter of 2020, but due to the unprecedented decline in the second quarter of 2020 is expected to decline approximately 5% in all of 2020. GDP continues to grow throughout 2021, but at a declining rate and is not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels until early 2022. The national unemployment rate forecast is 10.7% in the third quarter of 2020 and 9.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020, and is forecast to remain in the upper-single digits throughout 2021. 

To the extent we identified credit risk considerations that were not captured by the third-party economic forecast, we addressed the risk through management&#8217;s qualitative adjustments to the ALLL. 

As a result of the unprecedented economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our future loss estimates may vary considerably from our September 30, 2020, assumptions. 

Commercial Loan Portfolio 

The ALLL from continuing operations for the commercial segment increased by $ 68 million, or 6.1 %, from June 30, 2020. The overall increase in the allowance is driven by updated economic forecasts and downward portfolio migration, which are partially offset by a decline in loan balances. 

The primary changes to the economic forecast include modest deterioration in the unemployment and GDP growth outlook, which contributes to the ALLL increase for the overall commercial segment. Improvements in real estate price indices contributed to a modest reduction in reserve in our commercial real estate book. Risk rating migrations are also driving higher ALLL levels for the commercial and industrial segment. We continue to closely monitor the oil &#38; gas exposure and the ALLL results reflect incremental risk considerations for this segment. 

As of September 30, 2020, we concluded that no ALLL is necessary for $ 8.0 billion in outstanding PPP loans as they are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. 

Table of contents 

Consumer Loan Portfolio 

The ALLL from continuing operations for the consumer segment decreased by $ 46 million, or 7.7 %, from June 30, 2020. The overall decrease in the allowance is driven by updated economic forecasts that capture an improving outlook for several drivers and strong portfolio performance. 

The most meaningful changes to the economic forecast contributing to the reduction in reserves include improvement in the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index forecast, which impacts the indirect loan portfolio, as well as improvement in the HPI outlook as the housing market continues to display strength, which impacts the residential mortgage and home equity segments. As it relates to the decline in the ALLL due to portfolio factors, shifts are largely driven by attrition activity, targeted portfolio growth and overall strong credit drivers. The ALLL results also reflect incremental credit risk considerations as a result of the economic stress and related borrower assistance programs, which are addressed through qualitative adjustments. 

Credit Risk Profile 

The prevalent risk characteristic for both commercial and consumer loans is the risk of loss arising from an obligor&#8217;s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Evaluation of this risk is stratified and monitored by the loan risk rating grades assigned for the commercial loan portfolios and the refreshed FICO score assigned for the consumer loan portfolios. The internal risk grades assigned to loans follow our definitions of Pass and Criticized, which are consistent with published definitions of regulatory risk classifications. Loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on our rating scale for problem credits, as minimal credit risk has been identified. Criticized loans are those loans that either have a potential weakness deserving management's close attention or have a well-defined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk. Borrower FICO scores provide information about the credit quality of our consumer loan portfolio as they provide an indication as to the likelihood that a debtor will repay its debts. The scores are obtained from a nationally recognized consumer rating agency and are presented in the tables below at the dates indicated. 

Most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring. Loan grades are assigned at the time of origination, verified by credit risk management, and periodically re-evaluated thereafter. This risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling. Commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings. The first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation; the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility. Default probability is determined based on, among other factors, the financial strength of the borrower, an assessment of the borrower&#8217;s management, the borrower&#8217;s competitive position within its industry sector, and our view of industry risk in the context of the general economic outlook. Types of exposure, transaction structure, and collateral, including credit risk mitigants, affect the expected recovery assessment.

Nonperforming and Past Due Loans 

Our policies for determining past due loans, placing loans on nonaccrual, applying payments on nonaccrual loans, and resuming accrual of interest for our commercial and consumer loan portfolios are disclosed in Note 1 (&#8221;Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies&#8221;) and Note 1 (&#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Nonperforming Loans&#8221; beginning on page 101 of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Under the CARES Act as well as banking regulator interagency guidance, certain loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial distress as a result of the economic impacts created by the COVID-19 pandemic may not be required to be reported as past due and nonperforming. For COVID-19 related loan modifications which occurred from March 1, 2020, through September 30, 2020, and met the loan modification criteria under either the CARES Act or the criteria specified by the regulatory agencies, we have elected to re-age to current status all commercial loans and consumer loans that are not secured by real-estate and freeze the delinquency status of consumer real estate secured loans as of the modification or forbearance grant date. At September 30, 2020, $ 4.5 billion of loan modifications and forbearances made under the criteria of either the CARES Act or banking regulator interagency guidance were not reported as nonperforming. 

The following aging analysis of past due and current loans as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, provides further information regarding Key&#8217;s credit exposure.

(a) Amounts in table represent recorded investment and exclude loans held for sale. Recorded investment represents the principal amount of the loan increased or decreased by net deferred loan fees and costs, and unamortized premium or discount, and reflects direct charge-offs. 

(b) Past due loan amounts exclude PCI, even if contractually past due (or if we do not expect to collect principal or interest in full based on the original contractual terms), as we are currently accreting income over the remaining term of the loans. 

At September 30, 2020, the approximate carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 77 % of their original contractual amount owed, total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 80 % of their original contractual amount owed, and nonperforming assets in total were carried at 87 % of their original contractual amount owed. 

Nonperforming loans reduced expected interest income by $ 7 million and $ 20 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, and $ 7 million and $ 24 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. 

The amortized cost basis of nonperforming loans on nonaccrual status for which there is no related allowance for credit losses was $ 456 million at September 30, 2020. 

Collateral-dependent Financial Assets 

We classify financial assets as collateral-dependent when our borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and we expect repayment to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. Our commercial loans have collateral that includes commercial machinery, commercial properties, and commercial real estate construction projects. Our consumer loans have collateral that includes residential real estate, automobiles, boats, and RVs. 

Table of contents 

There were no significant changes in the extent to which collateral secures our collateral-dependent financial assets during the three months ended September 30, 2020 . 

TDRs 

We classify loan modifications as TDRs when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and we have granted a concession without commensurate financial, structural, or legal consideration. Our loan modifications are handled on a case-by-case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet the borrower&#8217;s financial needs. Under the CARES Act as well as banking regulator interagency guidance, certain loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial distress as a result of the economic impacts created by the COVID-19 pandemic may not be required to be treated as TDRs under U.S. GAAP. We elected to suspend TDR accounting for $ 4.5 billion of COVID-19 related loan modifications as of September 30, 2020 as such loan modifications met the criteria under either the CARES Act or banking regulator interagency guidance. 

Commitments outstanding to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loan terms have been modified in TDRs were $ 1 million and $ 5 million at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

The consumer TDR other concession category in the table below primarily includes those borrowers&#8217; debts that are discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been formally re-affirmed.

5. Fair Value Measurements 

In accordance with GAAP, Key measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in our principal market. Additional information regarding our accounting policies for determining fair value is provided in Note 6 (&#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221;) and Note 1 (&#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; of our 2019 Form 10-K.

(a) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheet. 

(b) Netting adjustments represent the amounts recorded to convert our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The net basis takes into account the impact of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral. Total derivative assets and liabilities include these netting adjustments.

Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques 

The following table describes the valuation techniques and significant inputs used to measure the classes of assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as the classification of each within the valuation hierarchy. 

Asset/liability class Valuation technique Valuation hierarchy classification(s) Securities (includes trading account assets, securities available for sale, and U.S. Treasury Bills classified as short-term investments) Fair value of Level 1 securities is determined by: 

&#8226; Quoted market prices available in an active market for identical securities. This includes exchange-traded equity securities. 

Fair value of Level 2 securities is determined by: 

&#8226; Pricing models (either by a third party pricing service or internally). Inputs include: yields, benchmark securities, bids, offers, actual trade data (i.e., spreads, credit ratings, and interest rates) for comparable assets, spread tables, matrices, high-grade scales, and option-adjusted spreads. 

&#8226; Observable market prices of similar securities. 

Fair value of Level 3 securities is determined by: 

&#8226; Internally developed valuation techniques, principally discounted cash flow methods (income approach). 

&#8226; Revenue multiples of comparable public companies (market approach). 

For Level 3 securities, increases (decreases) in the discount rate and marketability discount used in the discounted cash flow models would have resulted in lower (higher) fair value measurements. Higher volatility factors would have further magnified changes in fair value. 

The valuations provided by the third-party pricing service are based on observable market inputs, which include benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data obtained from market research publications. Inputs used by the third-party pricing service in valuing CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities also include new issue data, monthly payment information, whole loan collateral performance, and &#8220;To Be Announced&#8221; prices. In valuations of securities issued by state and political subdivisions, inputs used by the third-party pricing service also include material event notices. 

Level 1, 2, and 3 (primarily Level 2) Commercial loans (trading account assets) Fair value is based on: 

&#8226; Observable market price spreads for similar loans. Valuations reflect prices within the bid-ask spread that are most representative of fair value. 

Level 2 

Principal investments (direct) 

Direct principal investments consist of equity and debt instruments of private companies made by our principal investing entities. Fair value is determined using: 

&#8226; Operating performance and market multiples of comparable businesses 

&#8226; Other unique facts and circumstances related to each individual investment 

Direct principal investments are accounted for as investment companies in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, whereby each investment is adjusted to fair value with any net realized or unrealized gain/loss recorded in the current period&#8217;s earnings. 

We are in the process of winding down our direct principal investment portfolio. As of September 30, 2020, the balance is less than $1 million. 

Level 3 

Principal investments (indirect) Indirect principal investments include primary and secondary investments in private equity funds engaged mainly in venture- and growth-oriented investing. These investments do not have readily determinable fair values and qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value based upon net asset value per share (or its equivalent, such as member units or an ownership interest in partners&#8217; capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed). 

Indirect principal investments are also accounted for as investment companies, whereby each investment is adjusted to fair value with any net realized or unrealized gain/loss recorded in the current period&#8217;s earnings. 

Under the provisions of the Volcker Rule, we are required to dispose or conform our indirect investments to the requirements of the statute by no later than July 21, 2022. As of September 30, 2020, we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments. Therefore, these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology. 

NAV 

The following table presents the fair value of our direct and indirect principal investments and related unfunded commitments at September 30, 2020, as well as financial support provided for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, and September 30, 2019.

(a) Our indirect investments consist of buyout funds, venture capital funds, and fund of funds. These investments are generally not redeemable. Instead, distributions are received through the liquidation of the underlying investments of the fund. An investment in any one of these funds typically can be sold only with the approval of the fund&#8217;s general partners. At September 30, 2020, no significant liquidation of the underlying investments has been communicated to Key. The purpose of funding our capital commitments to these investments is to allow the funds to make additional follow-on investments and pay fund expenses until the fund dissolves. We, and all other investors in the fund, are obligated to fund the full amount of our respective capital commitments to the fund based on our and their respective ownership percentages, as noted in the applicable Limited Partnership Agreement. 

Asset/liability class Valuation technique Valuation hierarchy classification(s) Other direct equity investments Fair value is determined using: 

&#8226; Discounted cash flows 

&#8226; Operating performance and market/exit multiples of comparable businesses 

&#8226; Other unique facts and circumstances related to each individual investment 

For Level 3 securities, increases (decreases) in the discount rate and marketability discount used in the discounted cash flow models would have resulted in lower (higher) fair value measurements. Higher volatility factors would have further magnified changes in fair value. Level 2 investments reflect the price of recent investments, which is deemed representative of fair value. 

Level 2 and 3 Other direct and indirect equity investments (NAV) Certain direct investments do not have readily determinable fair values and qualify for the practical expedient in the accounting guidance that allows us to estimate fair value based upon net asset value per share. 

NAV Loans held for sale and held for investment (residential) Residential mortgage loans held for sale are accounted for at fair value. The election of the fair value option aligns the accounting for these assets with the related forward loan sale commitments. Fair values are based on: 

&#8226; Quoted market prices, where available 

&#8226; Prices for other traded mortgage loans with similar characteristics 

&#8226; Purchase commitments and bid information received from market participants 

Prices are adjusted as necessary to include: 

&#8226; The embedded servicing value in the loans 

&#8226; The specific characteristics of certain loans that are priced based on the pricing of similar loans. (These adjustments represent unobservable inputs to the valuation but are not considered significant given the relative insensitivity of the value to changes in these inputs to the fair value of the loans.) 

Residential loans held for investment: Certain residential loans held for sale contain salability exceptions that make them unable to be sold into the performing loan sales market. Loans in this category are transferred to the held to maturity loan portfolio and are included in &#8220;Loans, net of unearned income&#8221; on the balance sheet. This type of loan is classified as Level 3 in the valuation hierarchy as transaction details regarding sales of this type of loan are often unavailable. 

Fair value is based upon: 

&#8226; Unobservable bid information from brokers and investors 

Higher (lower) unobservable bid information would have resulted in higher (lower) fair value measurements. 

Level 1, 2 and 3 (primarily Level 2)

Asset/liability class Valuation technique Valuation hierarchy classification(s) Derivatives Exchange-traded derivatives are valued using quoted prices in active markets and, therefore, are classified as Level 1 instruments. 

The majority of our derivative positions are Level 2 and are valued using internally developed models based on market convention and observable market inputs. These derivative contracts include interest rate swaps, certain options, floors, cross currency swaps, credit default swaps, and forward mortgage loan sale commitments. Significant inputs used in the valuation models include: 

&#8226; LIBOR and OIS curves, index pricing curves, foreign currency curves 

&#8226; Volatility surfaces (a three-dimensional graph of implied volatility against strike price and maturity) 

We have customized derivative instruments and risk participations that are classified as Level 3 instruments. These derivative positions are valued using internally developed models, with inputs consisting of available market data, including: 

&#8226; Credit spreads and interest rates 

The unobservable internally derived assumptions include: 

&#8226; Loss given default 

&#8226; Internal risk assessments of customers 

The fair value represents an estimate of the amount that the risk participation counterparty would need to pay/receive as of the measurement date based on the probability of customer default on the swap transaction and the fair value of the underlying customer swap. Therefore, for sold risk participation agreements, a higher loss probability and a lower credit rating would negatively affect the fair value of the risk participations and a lower loss probability and higher credit rating would positively affect the fair value of the risk participations. (For purchased risk participation agreements, higher loss probabilities and lower credit ratings would positively affect the fair value.) 

We use interest rate lock commitments for our residential mortgage business, which are classified as Level 3 instruments. The significant components of the valuation model include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Interest rates observable in the market 

&#8226; Investor supplied prices for similar securities 

&#8226; The probability of the loan closing (i.e. the "pull-through" amount, a significant unobservable input). Increases (decreases) in the probability of the loan closing would have resulted in higher (lower) fair value measurements. 

Valuation of residential mortgage forward sale commitments utilizes observable market prices of comparable commitments and mortgage securities (Level 2). 

Level 1, 2, and 3 (primarily Level 2) Liability for short positions This includes fixed income securities held by our broker dealer in its trading inventory. Fair value of Level 1 securities is determined by: 

&#8226; Quoted market prices available in an active market for identical securities 

Fair value of Level 2 securities is determined by: 

&#8226; Observable market prices of similar securities 

&#8226; Market activity, spreads, credit ratings and interest rates for each security type 

Level 1 and 2

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to fair value generally result from the application of accounting guidance that requires assets and liabilities to be recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, or assessed for impairment. There were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. 

The following table presents our assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019:

Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques 

The following table describes the valuation techniques and significant inputs used to measure the significant classes of assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, as well as the classification of each within the valuation hierarchy. 

Asset/liability class Valuation technique Valuation hierarchy classification(s) 

Collateral-dependent loans 

When a loan is collateral-dependent, the fair value of the loan is determined based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. Level 3 Commercial loans and student loans held for sale Through a quarterly analysis of our loan portfolios held for sale, which include both performing and nonperforming commercial loans and student loans, we determine any adjustments necessary to record the portfolios at the lower of cost or fair value in accordance with GAAP. Valuation inputs include: 

&#8226; Non-binding bids for the respective loans or similar loans 

&#8226; Recent sales transactions 

&#8226; Internal models that emulate recent securitizations 

Level 2 and 3 Direct financing leases and operating lease assets held for sale Valuations of direct financing leases and operating lease assets held for sale are performed using an internal model that relies on market data, including: 

&#8226; Swap rates and bond ratings 

&#8226; Our own assumptions about the exit market for the leases 

&#8226; Details about the individual leases in the portfolio 

Leases for which we receive a current nonbinding bid, and for which the sale is considered probable, may be classified as Level 2. Valuations of lease and operating lease assets held for sale that employ our own assumptions are classified as Level 3 assets. The inputs based on our own assumptions include changes in the value of leased items and internal credit ratings. 

Level 2 and 3 

OREO, other repossessed personal property, and right-of-use assets (a) 

OREO, other repossessed properties, and right-of-use assets are valued based on: 

&#8226; Appraisals and third-party price opinions, less estimated selling costs 

Generally, we classify these assets as Level 3, but OREO and other repossessed properties for which we receive binding purchase agreements are classified as Level 2. Returned lease inventory is valued based on market data for similar assets and is classified as Level 2. 

Level 2 and 3 

Table of contents 

Asset/liability class Valuation technique Valuation hierarchy classification(s) 

LIHTC, HTC, and NMTC investments (a) 

Valuation of LIHTC, HTC and NMTC involves measuring the present value of future tax benefits and comparing that value against the current carrying value of the investment. Expected future tax benefits are discounted to their present value using discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium. LIHTC and HTC investments are impaired when it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of the investment will not be realized. Level 3 

Other equity investments 

We have other investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values and do not qualify for the practical expedient to measure the investment using a net asset value per share. We have elected to measure these securities at cost less impairment plus or minus adjustments due to observable orderly transactions. Impairment is recorded when there is evidence that the expected fair value of the investment has declined to below the recorded cost. At each reporting period, we assess if these investments continue to qualify for this measurement alternative. At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the carrying amount of equity investments under this method was $158 million and $134 million, respectively. No impairment was recorded for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2020. Level 3

Table of contents 

Valuation Methods and Assumptions 

(a) Fair value equals or approximates carrying amount. The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity does not take into consideration the value ascribed to core deposit intangibles. 

(b) Information pertaining to our methodology for measuring the fair values of these assets and liabilities is included in the sections entitled &#8220;Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques&#8221; and &#8220;Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis&#8221; in this Note. Investments accounted for under the cost method (or cost less impairment adjusted for observable price changes for certain equity investments) are classified as Level 3 assets. These investments are not actively traded in an open market as sales for these types of investments are rare. The carrying amount of the investments carried at cost are adjusted for declines in value if they are considered to be other-than-temporary (or due to observable orderly transactions of the same issuer for equity investments eligible for the cost less impairment measurement alternative). These adjustments are included in &#8220;other income&#8221; on the income statement. 

(c) Fair values of held-to-maturity securities are determined by using models that are based on security-specific details, as well as relevant industry and economic factors. The most significant of these inputs are quoted market prices, interest rate spreads on relevant benchmark securities, and certain prepayment assumptions. We review the valuations derived from the models to ensure that they are reasonable and consistent with the values placed on similar securities traded in the secondary markets. 

(d) The fair value of loans is based on the present value of the expected cash flows. The projected cash flows are based on the contractual terms of the loans, adjusted for prepayments and use of a discount rate based on the relative risk of the cash flows, taking into account the loan type, maturity of the loan, liquidity risk, servicing costs, and a required return on debt and capital. In addition, an incremental liquidity discount is applied to certain loans, using historical sales of loans during periods of similar economic conditions as a benchmark. The fair value of loans includes lease financing receivables at their aggregate carrying amount, which is equivalent to their fair value. 

(e) Fair values of time deposits and long-term debt are based on discounted cash flows utilizing relevant market inputs. 

(f) Netting adjustments represent the amounts recorded to convert our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The net basis takes into account the impact of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral. Total derivative assets and liabilities include these netting adjustments. 

(g) Derivative assets-hedging and derivative liabilities-hedging includes both cash flow and fair value hedges. Additional information regarding our accounting policies for cash flow and fair value hedges is provided in Note 1 (&#8220;1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging&#8221; beginning on page 105 of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

DIscontinued assets &#8212; education lending business . &#160; Our discontinued assets include government-guaranteed and private education loans originated through our education lending business that was discontinued in September 2009. This portfolio consists of loans recorded at carrying value with appropriate valuation reserves, and loans in portfolio recorded at fair value. All of these loans were excluded from the table above as follows: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Loans at carrying value, net of allowance, of $ 701 million ($ 593 million at fair value) at September 30, 2020, and $ 855 million ($ 729 million at fair value) at December 31, 2019; 

&#8226; Portfolio loans at fair value of $ 2 million at September 30, 2020, and $ 2 million at December 31, 2019. 

These loans and securities are classified as Level 3 because we rely on unobservable inputs when determining fair value since observable market data is not available. 

6. Securities 

The amortized cost, unrealized gains and losses, and approximate fair value of our securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities are presented in the following tables. Gross unrealized gains and losses represent the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of securities on the balance sheet as of the dates indicated. Accordingly, the amount of these gains and losses may change in the future as market conditions change.

At September 30, 2020, gross unrealized losses totaled less than $ 1 million for agency residential mortgage-backed securities available for sale with a loss duration greater than 12 months or longer. At September 30, 2020, gross unrealized losses totaled less than $ 1 million for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations held-to-maturity with a loss duration greater than 12 months or longer. 

(b) At December 31, 2019, gross unrealized losses totaled less than $ 1 million for U.S. Treasury, agencies, and corporations and agency residential mortgage-backed securities available for sale with a loss duration of less than 12 months. At December 31, 2019, gross unrealized losses totaled less than $ 1 million for U.S. Treasury, Agencies, and Corporations securities available for sale with a loss duration greater than 12 months or longer. At December 31, 2019, gross unrealized losses totaled less than $ 1 million for agency residential mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and other securities held-to-maturity with a loss duration of less than 12 months. 

Based on our evaluation at September 30, 2020, under the new impairment model, an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded nor have unrealized losses been recognized into income. The issuers of the securities are of high credit quality and have a long history of no credit losses, management does not intend to sell and it is likely that management will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely attributed to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments. 

At September 30, 2020, securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities totaling $ 12.5 billion were pledged to secure securities sold under repurchase agreements, to secure public and trust deposits, to facilitate access to secured funding, and for other purposes required or permitted by law. 

The following table shows our securities by remaining maturity. CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities in the available for sale portfolio and held-to-maturity portfolio are presented based on their expected average lives. The remaining securities, in both the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios, are presented based on their remaining contractual maturity. Actual maturities may differ from expected or contractual maturities since borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.

7. Derivatives and Hedging Activities 

We are a party to various derivative instruments, mainly through our subsidiary, KeyBank. The primary derivatives that we use are interest rate swaps, caps, floors, and futures; foreign exchange contracts; commodity derivatives; and credit derivatives. Generally, these instruments help us manage exposure to interest rate risk, mitigate the credit risk inherent in our loan portfolio, hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and meet client financing and hedging needs. 

At September 30, 2020, after taking into account the effects of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements, we had $ 105 million of derivative assets and $ 2 million of derivative liabilities that relate to contracts entered into for hedging purposes. As of the same date, after taking into account the effects of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements and a reserve for potential future losses, we had derivative assets of $ 1.8 billion and derivative liabilities of $ 166 million that were not designated as hedging instruments. These positions are primarily comprised of derivative contracts entered into for client accommodation purposes. 

Additional information regarding our accounting policies for derivatives is provided in Note 1 (&#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging&#8221; beginning on page 105 of our 2019 Form 10-K. Our derivative strategies and related risk management objectives are described in Note 8 (&#8220;Derivatives and Hedging Activities&#8221;) beginning on page 134 of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Fair Values, Volume of Activity, and Gain/Loss Information Related to Derivative Instruments 

The following table summarizes the fair values of our derivative instruments on a gross and net basis as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. The derivative asset and liability balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements, but after the variation margin payments with central clearing organizations have been applied as settlement, as applicable. Total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted to take into account the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral. Securities collateral related to legally enforceable master netting agreements is not offset on the balance sheet. Our derivative instruments are included in &#8220;accrued income and other assets&#8221; or &#8220;accrued expenses and other liabilities&#8221; on the balance sheet, as follows:

(b) Netting adjustments represent the amounts recorded to convert our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. 

(c) Other collateral represents the amount that cannot be used to offset our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The other collateral consists of securities and is exchanged under bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that allow us to offset the net derivative position with the related collateral. The application of the other collateral cannot reduce the net derivative position below zero. Therefore, excess other collateral, if any, is not reflected above. 

Fair value hedges. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, we did not exclude any portion of fair value hedging instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 

The following tables summarize the amounts that were recorded on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges.

Cash flow hedges. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, we did not exclude any portion of cash flow hedging instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 

Considering the interest rates, yield curves, and notional amounts as of September 30, 2020, we expect to reclassify an estimated $ 253 million of after-tax net gains on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges from AOCI to income during the next 12 months. In addition, we expect to reclassify approximately $ 74 million of net gains related to terminated cash flow hedges from AOCI to income during the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2020, the maximum length of time over which we hedge forecasted transactions is 9 years. 

The following tables summarize the effect of fair value and cash flow hedge accounting on the income statement for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020, and September 30, 2019.

Net investment hedges. We previously entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to changes in the carrying value of our investments in foreign subsidiaries as a result of changes in the related foreign exchange rates. In December 2019, our last remaining net investment hedge was discontinued in connection with the substantial liquidation of the net assets of KEF&#8217;s Canadian subsidiary. Additional information regarding the discontinuance of this net investment hedge is provided in Note 8 (&#8220;Derivatives and Hedging Activities&#8221;) on page 137 of our 2019 Form 10-K.

Counterparty Credit Risk 

We hold collateral in the form of cash and highly rated securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, government-sponsored enterprises, or GNMA. Cash collateral of $ 44 million was netted against derivative assets on the balance sheet at September 30, 2020, compared to $ 207 million of cash collateral netted against derivative assets at December 31, 2019. The cash collateral netted against derivative liabilities totaled $ 234 million at September 30, 2020, and $ 69 million at December 31, 2019. Our means of mitigating and managing exposure to credit risk on derivative contracts is described in Note 8 (&#8220;Derivatives and Hedging Activities&#8221;) beginning on page 138 of our 2019 Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Counterparty Credit Risk.&#8221; 

The following table summarizes the fair value of our derivative assets by type at the dates indicated. These assets represent our gross exposure to potential loss after taking into account the effects of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements and other means used to mitigate risk.

We enter into derivative transactions with two primary groups: broker-dealers and banks, and clients. Given that these groups have different economic characteristics, we have different methods for managing counterparty credit exposure and credit risk. 

We enter into transactions with broker-dealers and banks for various risk management purposes. These types of 

transactions are primarily high dollar volume. We enter into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements with 

these counterparties. We clear certain types of derivative transactions with these counterparties, whereby central 

clearing organizations become the counterparties to our derivative contracts. In addition, we enter into derivative 

contracts through swap execution facilities. Swap clearing and swap execution facilities reduce our exposure to 

counterparty credit risk. At September 30, 2020, we had gross exposure of $ 411 million to broker-dealers and banks. We had net exposure of $ 260 million after the application of master netting agreements and cash collateral, where such qualifying agreements exist. We had net exposure of $ 257 million after considering $ 3 million of additional collateral held in the form of securities. 

We enter into transactions using master netting agreements with clients to accommodate their business needs. In 

most cases, we mitigate our credit exposure by cross-collateralizing these transactions to the underlying loan collateral. For transactions that are not clearable, we mitigate our market risk by buying and selling U.S. Treasuries and Eurodollar futures or entering into offsetting positions. Due to the cross-collateralization to the underlying loan, we typically do not exchange cash or marketable securities collateral in connection with these transactions. To address the risk of default associated with these contracts, we have established a CVA reserve (included in 

&#8220;accrued income and other assets&#8221;) in the amount of $ 72 million at September 30, 2020. The CVA is calculated from 

potential future exposures, expected recovery rates, and market-implied probabilities of default. At September 30, 2020, we had gross exposure of $ 1.9 billion to client counterparties and other entities that are not broker-dealers or banks for derivatives that have associated master netting agreements. We had net exposure of $ 1.7 billion on our derivatives with these counterparties after the application of master netting agreements, collateral, and the related reserve. 

Credit Derivatives 

We are a buyer and, under limited circumstances, may be a seller of credit protection through the credit derivative market. We purchase credit derivatives to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending and swap obligations as well as exposures to debt securities. Our credit derivative portfolio was in a net liability position of $ 12 million as of September 30, 2020, and $ 9 million as of December 31, 2019. Our credit derivative portfolio consists of traded credit default swap indices and risk participation agreements. Additional descriptions of our credit derivatives are provided in Note 8 (&#8220;Derivatives and Hedging Activities&#8221;) beginning on page 139 of our 2019 Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Credit Derivatives.&#8221; 

The following table provides information on the types of credit derivatives sold by us and held on the balance sheet at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. The notional amount represents the amount that the seller could 

be required to pay. The payment/performance risk shown in the table represents a weighted average of the default 

probabilities for all reference entities in the respective portfolios. These default probabilities are implied from 

observed credit indices in the credit default swap market, which are mapped to reference entities based on Key&#8217;s 

internal risk rating.

Credit Risk Contingent Features 

We have entered into certain derivative contracts that require us to post collateral to the counterparties when these contracts are in a net liability position. The amount of collateral to be posted is based on the amount of the net liability and thresholds generally related to our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings with Moody&#8217;s and S&#38;P. Collateral requirements also are based on minimum transfer amounts, which are specific to each Credit Support Annex (a component of the ISDA Master Agreement) that we have signed with the counterparties. In a limited number of instances, counterparties have the right to terminate their ISDA Master Agreements with us if our ratings fall below a certain level, usually investment-grade level (i.e., &#8220;Baa3&#8221; for Moody&#8217;s and &#8220;BBB-&#8221; for S&#38;P). At September 30, 2020, KeyBank&#8217;s rating was &#8220;A3&#8221; with Moody&#8217;s and &#8220;A-&#8221; with S&#38;P, and KeyCorp&#8217;s rating was &#8220; Baa1 &#8221; with Moody&#8217;s and &#8220; BBB+ &#8221; with S&#38;P. As of September 30, 2020, the aggregate fair value of all derivative contracts with credit risk contingent features (i.e., those containing collateral posting or termination provisions based on our ratings) held by KeyBank that were in a net liability position totaled $ 177 million, which was comprised of $ 108 million in derivative assets and $ 285 million in derivative liabilities. We had $ 175 million in cash and securities collateral posted to cover those positions as of September 30, 2020. There were no derivative contracts with credit risk contingent features held by KeyCorp at September 30, 2020. 

The following table summarizes the additional cash and securities collateral that KeyBank would have been required to deliver under the ISDA Master Agreements had the credit risk contingent features been triggered for the derivative contracts in a net liability position as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. The additional collateral amounts were calculated based on scenarios under which KeyBank&#8217;s ratings are downgraded one, two, or three ratings as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, and take into account all collateral already posted. A similar calculation was performed for KeyCorp, and no additional collateral would have been required as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. For more information about the credit ratings for KeyBank and KeyCorp, see the discussion under the heading &#8220;Factors affecting liquidity&#8221; in the section entitled &#8220;Liquidity risk management&#8221; in Item 2 of this report.

KeyBank&#8217;s long-term senior unsecured credit rating was four ratings above noninvestment grade at Moody&#8217;s and S&#38;P as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. If KeyBank&#8217;s ratings had been downgraded below investment grade as of September 30, 2020, or December 31, 2019, payments of $ 3 million and $ 3 million, respectively, would have been required to either terminate the contracts or post additional collateral for those contracts in a net liability position, taking into account all collateral already posted. If KeyCorp&#8217;s ratings had been downgraded below investment grade as of September 30, 2020, or December 31, 2019, no payments would have been required to either terminate the contracts or post additional collateral for those contracts in a net liability position, taking into account all collateral already posted. 

8. Mortgage Servicing Assets 

We originate and periodically sell commercial and residential mortgage loans but continue to service those loans for the buyers. We also may purchase the right to service commercial mortgage loans for other lenders. We record a servicing asset if we purchase or retain the right to service loans in exchange for servicing fees that exceed the going market servicing rate and are considered more than adequate compensation for servicing. Additional information pertaining to the accounting for mortgage and other servicing assets is included in Note 1 (&#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Servicing Assets&#8221; beginning on page 106 of our 2019 Form 10-K.

Commercial 

Changes in the carrying amount of commercial mortgage servicing assets are summarized as follows: 

&#160; Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, in millions 2020 2019 2020 2019 Balance at beginning of period $ 565 &#160; $ 509 &#160; $ 539 &#160; $ 502 &#160; Servicing retained from loan sales 30 &#160; 30 &#160; 107 &#160; 71 &#160; Purchases 6 &#160; 10 &#160; 24 &#160; 33 &#160; Amortization ( 29 ) ( 29 ) ( 88 ) ( 86 ) Temporary impairments ( 6 ) ( 2 ) ( 16 ) ( 2 ) Balance at end of period $ 566 &#160; $ 518 &#160; $ 566 &#160; $ 518 &#160; Fair value at end of period $ 685 &#160; $ 681 &#160; $ 685 &#160; $ 681 &#160; 

The fair value of commercial mortgage servicing assets is determined by calculating the present value of future cash flows associated with servicing the loans. This calculation uses a number of assumptions that are based on current market conditions. The range and weighted average of the significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value of our commercial mortgage servicing assets at September 30, 2020, and September 30, 2019, along with the valuation techniques, are shown in the following table: &#160; 

dollars in millions September 30, 2020 September 30, 2019 Valuation Technique Significant 

Unobservable Input 

Range 

(Weighted Average) 

Discounted cash flow Expected defaults 1.00 - 2.00% (1.17%) 1.00 - 2.00% (1.13%) Residual cash flows discount rate 7.72 - 10.66% (9.30%) 7.00 - 11.50% (9.30%) Escrow earn rate 0.92 - 1.16% (1.05%) 1.46 - 2.36% (2.02%) Loan assumption rate 0.00 - 1.78% (1.39%) 0.01 - 3.37% (1.38%) 

If these economic assumptions change or prove incorrect, the fair value of commercial mortgage servicing assets may also change. Expected credit losses, escrow earning rates, and discount rates are critical to the valuation of commercial mortgage servicing assets. Estimates of these assumptions are based on how a market participant would view the respective rates, and reflect historical data associated with the commercial mortgage loans, industry trends, and other considerations. Actual rates may differ from those estimated due to changes in a variety of economic factors. A decrease in the value assigned to the escrow earning rates would cause a decrease in the fair value of our commercial mortgage servicing assets. An increase in the assumed default rates of commercial mortgage loans or an increase in the assigned discount rates would cause a decrease in the fair value of our commercial mortgage servicing assets. Prepayment activity on commercial serviced loans does not significantly affect the valuation of our commercial mortgage servicing assets. Unlike residential mortgages, commercial mortgages experience significantly lower prepayments due to certain contractual restrictions affecting the borrower&#8217;s ability to prepay the mortgage. 

The amortization of commercial servicing assets is determined in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated net servicing income. The amortization of commercial servicing assets for each period, as shown in the table at the beginning of this note, is recorded as a reduction to contractual fee income. The contractual fee income from servicing commercial mortgage loans totaled $ 154 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, and $ 147 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019. This fee income was offset by $ 88 million of amortization for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, and $ 86 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019. Both the contractual fee income and the amortization are recorded, net, in &#8220;commercial mortgage servicing fees&#8221; on the income statement.

The fair value of mortgage servicing assets is determined by calculating the present value of future cash flows associated with servicing the loans. This calculation uses a number of assumptions that are based on current market conditions. The range and weighted-average of the significant unobservable inputs used to fair value our mortgage servicing assets at September 30, 2020, and September 30, 2019, along with the valuation techniques, are shown in the following table: 

September 30, 2020 September 30, 2019 Valuation Technique Significant

If these economic assumptions change or prove incorrect, the fair value of residential mortgage servicing assets may also change. Prepayment speed, discount rates, and servicing cost are critical to the valuation of servicing assets. Estimates of these assumptions are based on how a market participant would view the respective rates, and reflect historical data associated with the loans, industry trends, and other considerations. Actual rates may differ from those estimated due to changes in a variety of economic factors. An increase in the prepayment speed, assigned discount rates, and servicing cost assumptions would also cause a negative impact on the fair value of our residential mortgage servicing assets. 

The amortization of residential servicing assets is determined in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated net residential servicing income. The amortization of servicing assets for September 30, 2020, as shown in the table above, is recorded as a reduction to contractual fee income. The contractual fee income from servicing residential mortgage loans totaled $ 24 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, and $ 15 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019. This fee income was offset by $ 9 million of amortization for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, and $ 5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019. Both the contractual fee income and the amortization are recorded, net, in &#8220;consumer mortgage income&#8221; on the income statement. 

9. Leases 

As a lessee, we enter into leases of land, buildings, and equipment. Our real estate leases primarily relate to bank branches and office space. The leases of equipment principally relate to technology assets for data processing and data storage. As a lessor, we primarily provide financing through our equipment leasing business. For more information on our leasing activity, see Note 10 (&#8220;Leases&#8221;) beginning on page 143 of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Lessor Equipment Leasing 

Leases may have fixed or floating rate terms. Variable payments are based on an index or other specified rate and are included in rental payments. Certain leases contain an option to extend the lease term or the option to terminate at the discretion of the lessee. Under certain conditions, lease agreements may also contain the option for a lessee to purchase the underlying asset. 

Interest income from sales-type and direct financing leases is recognized in "interest income &#8212; loans" on the income statement. Income related to operating leases is recognized in &#8220;operating lease income and other leasing gains&#8221; on the income statement. The components of equipment leasing income are summarized in the table below:

In April 2020, the FASB provided elections under which entities can choose to account for eligible rent concessions either by applying the modification accounting in ASC 842 or by applying an expedient to account for them outside of the modification framework, thus, forgoing the performance of an assessment to determine whether contractual provisions in existing lease arrangements provide enforceable rights and obligations. Modification accounting may require remeasurement and reallocation of contract consideration. To be eligible for the expedient, rent concessions must relate to the COVID-19 pandemic and meet certain criteria. As a result of the pandemic, Key has begun providing lessees with 90 day deferrals on its equipment leases and has elected not to apply modification accounting. Rent concessions were not material at September 30, 2020. 

10. Goodwill 

Our annual goodwill impairment testing is performed as of October 1 each year, or more frequently as events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Additional information pertaining to our accounting policy for goodwill and other intangible assets is summarized in Note 1 (&#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#8221; beginning on page 145 of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Due to continued deterioration in the market and length of disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted Key&#8217;s market capitalization, we determined a triggering event occurred in the three months ended September 30, 2020. We conducted a quantitative interim impairment test as of September 30, 2020, and concluded goodwill was not impaired. 

Through the quantitative interim impairment test as of September 30, 2020, we determined that the estimated fair value of each of Key&#8217;s reporting units was greater than its carrying amount. The estimated fair value of the Consumer Bank reporting unit was 11 % greater than its carrying amount, the estimated fair value of the Commercial Bank reporting unit was 17 % greater than its carrying amount, and the estimated fair value of the Institutional Bank reporting unit, which is aggregated in the Commercial Bank reporting segment, was 11 % greater than its carrying amount. The fair values of each reporting unit were estimated using a combination of income and market approaches. The income approach, which was weighted at 75%, utilized discounted cash flow projections for each reporting unit. The market approach, which was weighted at 25%, consisted primarily of public company metrics but also considered recent transactions in the financial services industry. The carrying amounts of Key&#8217;s reporting units represent the average equity based on risk-weighted regulatory capital for goodwill impairment testing and management reporting purposes. 

We will continue to monitor and review for impairment indicators that could impact goodwill. 

11. Variable Interest Entities 

Our significant VIEs are summarized below. Additional information pertaining to the criteria used in determining if an entity is a VIE is included in Note 13 (&#8220;Variable Interest Entities &#8220;) beginning on page 146 of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

LIHTC investments. &#160; We had $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.5 billion of investments in LIHTC operating partnerships at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. These investments are recorded in &#8220;accrued income and other assets&#8221; on our balance sheet. We do not have any loss reserves recorded related to these investments because we believe the likelihood of any loss to be remote. For all legally binding, unfunded equity commitments, we increase our recognized investment and recognize a liability. As of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, we had liabilities of $ 477 million and $ 546 million, respectively, related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects, which are recorded in &#8220;accrued expenses and other liabilities&#8221; on our balance sheet. We continue to invest in these LIHTC operating partnerships. 

The assets and liabilities presented in the table below convey the size of KCDC&#8217;s direct and indirect investments at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. As these investments represent unconsolidated VIEs, the assets and liabilities of the investments themselves are not recorded on our balance sheet. Additional information pertaining to our LIHTC investments is included in Note 13 (&#8220;Variable Interest Entities&#8221;) beginning on page 146 of our 2019 Form 10-K.

We amortize our LIHTC investments over the period that we expect to receive the tax benefits. During the first nine months of 2020, we recognized $ 146 million of amortization and $ 134 million of tax credits associated with these investments within &#8220;income taxes&#8221; on our income statement. During the first nine months of 2019, we recognized $ 137 million of amortization and $ 135 million of tax credits associated with these investments within &#8220;income taxes&#8221; on our income statement. 

Principal investments. &#160; Our maximum exposure to loss associated with indirect principal investments consists of the investments&#8217; fair value plus any unfunded equity commitments. The fair value of our indirect principal investments totaled $ 60 million and $ 68 million at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. These investments are recorded in &#8220;other investments&#8221; on our balance sheet. The table below reflects the size of the private equity funds in which we were invested as well as our maximum exposure to loss in connection with these investments at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019.

Through our principal investing entities, we have formed and funded operating entities that provide management and other related services to our investment company funds, which directly invest in portfolio companies. These entities had no assets at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, that can be used to settle the entities&#8217; obligations. The entities had no liabilities at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, and other equity investors have no recourse to our general credit. 

Additional information on our indirect and direct principal investments is provided in Note 5 (&#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221;) and in Note 13 (&#8220;Variable Interest Entities &#8220;) beginning on page 146 of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Other unconsolidated VIEs. We are involved with other various entities in the normal course of business which we have determined to be VIEs. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our assets associated with these unconsolidated VIEs totaled $ 335 million at September 30, 2020, and $ 282 million at December 31, 2019. These assets are recorded in &#8220;accrued income and other assets,&#8221; &#8220;other investments,&#8221; &#8220;securities available for sale,&#8221; and &#8220;loans, net of unearned income&#8221; on our balance sheet. We had liabilities totaling $ 1 million and $ 1 million associated with these unconsolidated VIEs at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. Additional information pertaining to our other unconsolidated VIEs is included in Note 13 (&#8220;Variable Interest Entities&#8220;) under the heading &#8220;Other unconsolidated VIEs&#8221; on page 148 of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

12. Income Taxes 

Income Tax Provision 

In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the principal method established for computing the provision for income taxes in interim periods requires us to make our best estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year. This estimated effective tax rate is then applied to interim consolidated pre-tax operating income to determine the interim provision for income taxes. 

The effective tax rate, which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes, was 12.5 % for the third quarter of 2020 and 14.5 % for the third quarter of 2019. The effective tax rates are less than our combined federal and state statutory tax rate of 23.7 %, primarily due to income from investments in tax-advantaged 

Table of contents 

assets such as corporate-owned life insurance and credits associated with renewable energy and low-income housing investments. 

Deferred Taxes 

At September 30, 2020, we had a net deferred tax liability of $ 110 million, compared to a net deferred tax liability of $ 89 million at December 31, 2019, which are both included in &#8220;accrued income and other assets&#8221; on the balance sheet. 

To determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized, and therefore recorded, we conduct a quarterly assessment of all available evidence. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, taxable income in prior periods, projected future taxable income, and projected future reversals of deferred tax items. These assessments involve a degree of subjectivity and may undergo change. Based on these criteria, we had no valuation allowance at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. 

Unrecognized Tax Benefits 

At September 30, 2020, Key&#8217;s unrecognized tax benefits were $ 58 million. As permitted under the applicable accounting guidance for income taxes, it is our policy to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in &#8220;income tax expense.&#8221; 

Pre-1988 Bank Reserves Acquired in a Business Combination 

Retained earnings of KeyBank included approximately $ 92 million of allocated bad debt deductions for which no income taxes have been recorded. Under current federal law, these reserves are subject to recapture into taxable income if KeyBank, or any successor, fails to maintain its bank status under the Internal Revenue Code or makes non-dividend distributions or distributions greater than its accumulated earnings and profits. No deferred tax liability has been established as these events are not expected to occur in the foreseeable future. 

13. Acquisition and Discontinued Operations 

Acquisition 

Laurel Road Digital Lending Business. On April 3, 2019, KeyBank acquired Laurel Road's digital lending business from Laurel Road Bank. Laurel Road Bank's three bank branches located in southeast Connecticut were not part of this transaction. Through the acquisition, KeyBank expects to enhance its digital capabilities with state-of-the-art, customer-centric technology and to leverage Laurel Road's proven ability to attract and serve professional millennial clients. The acquisition is accounted for as a business combination. As a result of the acquisition, we recognized identifiable intangible assets with a fair value of $ 37 million and goodwill of $ 148 million. The valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities of Laurel Road was final at June 30, 2020. 

Discontinued operations 

Discontinued operations primarily includes our government-guaranteed and private education lending business. At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, approximately $ 743 million and $ 865 million, respectively, of education loans are included in discontinued assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Net interest income after provision for credit losses for this business is not material and is included in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes on the consolidated statements of income.

14. Securities Financing Activities 

We enter into repurchase agreements to finance overnight customer sweep deposits. We also enter into repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements to settle other securities obligations. We account for these securities financing agreements as collateralized financing transactions. Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements are recorded on the balance sheet at the amounts for which the securities will be subsequently sold or repurchased. Securities borrowed transactions are recorded on the balance sheet at the amounts of cash collateral advanced. While our securities financing agreements incorporate a right of set off, the assets and liabilities are reported on a gross basis. Reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are included in &#8220;short-term investments&#8221; on the balance sheet; repurchase agreements are included in &#8220;federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements.&#8221; Additional information regarding our securities financing activities, including risk management activities, is provided in Note 16 (&#8220;Securities Financing Activities&#8221;) beginning on page 151 of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

The following table summarizes our securities financing agreements at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019:

(a) Netting adjustments take into account the impact of master netting agreements that allow us to settle with a single counterparty on a net basis. 

(b) These adjustments take into account the impact of bilateral collateral agreements that allow us to offset the net positions with the related collateral. The application of collateral cannot reduce the net position below zero. Therefore, excess collateral, if any, is not reflected above. 

(c) Repurchase agreements are collateralized by mortgaged-backed agency securities and are contracted on an overnight or continuous basis. 

As of September 30, 2020, the carrying amount of assets pledged as collateral against repurchase agreements totaled $ 396 million. Assets pledged as collateral are reported in &#8220;securities available for sale&#8221; and &#8220;held-to-maturity securities&#8221; on our balance sheet. At September 30, 2020, the liabilities associated with collateral pledged were solely comprised of customer sweep financing activity and had a carrying value of $ 193 million. The collateral pledged under customer sweep repurchase agreements is posted to a third-party custodian and cannot be sold or repledged by the secured party. The risk related to a decline in the market value of collateral pledged is minimal given the collateral's high credit quality and the overnight duration of the repurchase agreements.

preferred securities and common stock to buy debentures issued by KeyCorp. These debentures are the trusts&#8217; only assets; the interest payments from the debentures finance the distributions paid on the mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities. The outstanding common stock of these business trusts is recorded in &#8220;other investments&#8221; on our balance sheet. We unconditionally guarantee the following payments or distributions on behalf of the trusts: 

&#160; 

&#8226; required distributions on the trust preferred securities; 

&#8226; the redemption price when a capital security is redeemed; and 

&#8226; the amounts due if a trust is liquidated or terminated. 

The Regulatory Capital Rules, discussed in &#8220;Supervision and regulation&#8221; in Item 2 of this report, require us to treat our mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities as Tier 2 capital.

(a) The trust preferred securities must be redeemed when the related debentures mature, or earlier if provided in the governing indenture. Each issue of trust preferred securities carries an interest rate identical to that of the related debenture. Certain trust preferred securities include basis adjustments related to fair value hedges totaling $ 75 million at September 30, 2020, and $ 57 million at December 31, 2019. See Note 7 (&#8220;Derivatives and Hedging Activities&#8221;) for an explanation of fair value hedges. 

(b) We have the right to redeem these debentures. If the debentures purchased by KeyCorp Capital I, HNC Statutory Trust III, Willow Grove Statutory Trust I, HNC Statutory Trust IV, Westbank Capital Trust II, or Westbank Capital Trust III are redeemed before they mature, the redemption price will be the principal amount, plus any accrued but unpaid interest. If the debentures purchased by KeyCorp Capital II or KeyCorp Capital III are redeemed before they mature, the redemption price will be the greater of: (i) the principal amount, plus any accrued but unpaid interest, or (ii) the sum of the present values of principal and interest payments discounted at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the applicable indenture), plus 20 basis points for KeyCorp Capital II or 25 basis points for KeyCorp Capital III, or 50 basis points in the case of redemption upon either a tax or a capital treatment event for either KeyCorp Capital II or KeyCorp Capital III, plus any accrued but unpaid interest. The principal amount of certain debentures includes basis adjustments related to fair value hedges totaling $ 75 million at September 30, 2020, and $ 57 million at December 31, 2019. See Note 7 (&#8220;Derivatives and Hedging Activities&#8221;) for an explanation of fair value hedges. The principal amount of debentures, net of discounts, is included in &#8220;long-term debt&#8221; on the balance sheet. 

(c) The interest rates for the trust preferred securities issued by KeyCorp Capital II and KeyCorp Capital III are fixed. The trust preferred securities issued by KeyCorp Capital I have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 74 basis points, that reprices quarterly. The trust preferred securities issued by HNC Statutory Trust III have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 140 basis points, that reprices quarterly. The trust preferred securities issued by Willow Grove Statutory Trust I have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 131 basis points, that reprices quarterly. The trust preferred securities issued by HNC Statutory Trust IV have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 128 basis points, that reprices quarterly. The trust preferred securities issued by Westbank Capital Trust II and Westbank Capital Trust III each have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 219 basis points, that reprices quarterly. The total interest rates are weighted-average rates. 

17. Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees 

Legal Proceedings 

Litigation. &#160; From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are subject to various litigation, investigations, and administrative proceedings. Private, civil litigations may range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to putative class action lawsuits with potentially thousands of class members. Investigations may involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both government agencies and self-regulatory bodies. These matters may involve claims for substantial monetary relief. At times, these matters may present novel claims or legal theories. Due to the complex nature of these various other matters, it may be years before some matters are resolved. While it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability, based on information presently known to us, we do not believe there is any matter to which we are a party, or involving any of our properties that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We continually monitor and reassess the potential materiality of these litigation matters. We note, however, that in light of the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution will not exceed established reserves. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter, or a combination of matters, may be material to our results of operations for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period. 

Table of contents 

Guarantees 

We are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties. The following table shows the types of guarantees that we had outstanding at September 30, 2020. Information pertaining to the basis for determining the liabilities recorded in connection with these guarantees is included in Note 1 (&#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Contingencies and Guarantees&#8221; beginning on page 108 of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

September 30, 2020 Maximum Potential Undiscounted Future Payments Liability Recorded in millions Financial guarantees: Standby letters of credit $ 3,107 &#160; $ 72 &#160; Recourse agreement with FNMA 5,662 &#160; 23 &#160; Residential mortgage reserve 2,280 &#160; 9 &#160; Written put options (a) 

3,284 &#160; 63 &#160; Total $ 14,333 &#160; $ 167 &#160; 

(a) The maximum potential undiscounted future payments represent notional amounts of derivatives qualifying as guarantees. 

We determine the payment/performance risk associated with each type of guarantee described below based on the probability that we could be required to make the maximum potential undiscounted future payments shown in the preceding table. We use a scale of low ( 0 % to 30 % probability of payment), moderate (greater than 30 % to 70 % probability of payment), or high (greater than 70 % probability of payment) to assess the payment/performance risk, and have determined that the payment/performance risk associated with each type of guarantee outstanding at September 30, 2020, is low. Information pertaining to the nature of each of the guarantees listed below is included in Note 22 (&#8220;Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Guarantees&#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Guarantees&#8221; beginning on page 165 of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Standby letters of credit. At September 30, 2020, our standby letters of credit had a remaining weighted-average life of 1.8 years, with remaining actual lives ranging from less than 1 year to as many as 14.2 years. 

Recourse agreement with FNMA. At September 30, 2020, the outstanding commercial mortgage loans in this program had a weighted-average remaining term of 7.9 years, and the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold by us as a participant was $ 18.8 billion. The maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments that we could be required to make under this program, as shown in the preceding table, is equal to approximately 30 % of the principal balance of loans outstanding at September 30, 2020. FNMA delegates responsibility for originating, underwriting, and servicing mortgages, and we assume a limited portion of the risk of loss during the remaining term on each commercial mortgage loan that we sell to FNMA. We maintain a reserve for such potential losses in an amount that we believe approximates the fair value of our liability in addition to the expected credit loss for the guarantee as described in Note 4 (&#8220;Asset Quality&#8220;). 

&#160; 

Residential Mortgage Banking. At September 30, 2020, the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold by us in this program was $ 7.6 billion. The maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments that we could be required to make under this program, as shown in the preceding table, is equal to approximately 30 % of the principal balance of loans outstanding at September 30, 2020. 

Our liability for estimated repurchase obligations on loans sold, which is included in other liabilities on our balance sheet, was $ 9 million at September 30, 2020. For more information on our residential mortgages, see Note 8 (&#8220;Mortgage Servicing Assets&#8220;). 

Written put options. At September 30, 2020, our written put options had an average life of three years . These written put options are accounted for as derivatives at fair value, as further discussed in Note 7 (&#8220;Derivatives and Hedging Activities&#8221;). 

Written put options where the counterparty is a broker-dealer or bank are accounted for as derivatives at fair value but are not considered guarantees since these counterparties typically do not hold the underlying instruments. In addition, we are a purchaser and seller of credit derivatives, which are further discussed in Note 7 (&#8220;Derivatives and Hedging Activities&#8221;). 

Table of contents 

Other Off-Balance Sheet Risk 

Other off-balance sheet risk stems from financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee as specified in the applicable accounting guidance, and from other relationships. Additional information pertaining to types of other off-balance sheet risk is included in Note 22 (&#8220;Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Guarantees&#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Other Off-Balance Sheet Risk&#8221; on page 168 of our 2019 Form 10-K.

20. Business Segment Reporting 

Consumer Bank 

The Consumer Bank serves individuals and small businesses throughout our 15 -state branch footprint by offering a variety of deposit and investment products, personal finance and financial wellness services, lending, mortgage and home equity, student loan refinancing, credit card, treasury services, and business advisory services. In addition, wealth management and investment services are offered to assist institutional, non-profit, and high-net-worth clients with their banking, trust, portfolio management, life insurance, charitable giving, and related needs. 

Table of contents 

Commercial Bank 

The Commercial Bank is an aggregation of our Institutional and Commercial operating segments. The Commercial operating segment is a full-service corporate bank focused principally on serving the needs of middle market clients in seven industry sectors: consumer, energy, healthcare, industrial, public sector, real estate, and technology. The Commercial operating segment is also a significant servicer of commercial mortgage loans and a significant special servicer of CMBS. The Institutional operating segment delivers a broad suite of banking and capital markets products to its clients, including syndicated finance, debt and equity capital markets, commercial payments, equipment finance, commercial mortgage banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, financial advisory, and public finance. 

Other 

Other includes various corporate treasury activities such as management of our investment securities portfolio, long-term debt, short-term liquidity and funding activities, and balance sheet risk management, our principal investing unit, and various exit portfolios as well as reconciling items which primarily represents the unallocated portion of nonearning assets of corporate support functions. Charges related to the funding of these assets are part of net interest income and are allocated to the business segments through noninterest expense. Reconciling items also include intercompany eliminations and certain items that are not allocated to the business segments because they do not reflect their normal operations. 

The development and application of the methodologies that we use to allocate items among our business segments is a dynamic process. Accordingly, financial results may be revised periodically to reflect enhanced alignment of expense base allocations drivers, changes in the risk profile of a particular business, or changes in our organizational structure. 

The table below shows selected financial data for our business segments for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020, and September 30, 2019.

Report of Ernst &#38; Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of KeyCorp 

Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements 

We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of KeyCorp as of September 30, 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, the related consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated interim financial statements&#8221;). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of KeyCorp as of December 31, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 26, 2020, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 

Basis for Review Results 

These financial statements are the responsibility of KeyCorp's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to KeyCorp in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
