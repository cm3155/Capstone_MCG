 Item 1A. Risk Factors 

For a discussion of certain risk factors affecting us, see the section titled &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; in Part I, Item 1. Business, on pages 12-29 of our 2022 Form 10-K; Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, on pages 29-43 of our 2022 Form 10-K; the sections titled &#8220;Supervision and regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Strategic developments&#8221; in this Form 10-Q; and our disclosure regarding forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q. The additional risk factor set forth below discusses new material risks that have become applicable since the filing of our 2022 Form 10-K. 

Recent bank failures have created significant market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and decreased confidence in the U.S. banking system. 

The failures of Silicon Valley Bank (&#8220;SVB&#8221;) and Signature Bank (&#8220;Signature) in March 2023, followed by the failure of First Republic Bank in May 2023, have caused significant market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and decreased confidence in the U.S. banking system. The recent bank failures occurred during a period of rapidly rising interest rates which, among other things, has resulted in unrealized losses in longer duration securities and more competition for bank deposits, and may increase the risk of a potential economic recession in the United States. Given the current environment, we may experience more deposit volatility as customers react to adverse events or market speculation involving financial institutions. 

Ratings agencies have also reacted to recent events by issuing updated ratings and assessments. On April 21, 2023, Moody&#8217;s lowered the macro profile of the U.S. banking system reflecting general concern around the banking industry as a whole. Moody&#8217;s also changed the credit ratings, or outlooks, for 20 U.S. banks, including Key. Moody&#8217;s affirmed all long-term and short-term ratings and assessments of KeyCorp and KeyBank, while changing KeyCorp and KeyBank&#8217;s rating outlook from &#8220;stable&#8221; to &#8220;negative&#8221; related to uncertainty in the banking industry following the recent bank failures. Our ratings are subject to further adjustments based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings as well as factors not entirely within our control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. 

In response to the bank failures, the United States government may adopt a variety of measures and new regulations designed to strengthen capital levels, liquidity standards, and risk management practices and otherwise restore confidence in financial institutions. Any reforms, if adopted, could have a significant impact on banks and BHCs, including Key. We may also be subject to any special assessment that the FDIC adopts to recover the loss to the DIF arising from the use of the systemic risk exception with respect to SVB and Signature Bank which assessment, if significant, could have a material impact to our results of operations.
