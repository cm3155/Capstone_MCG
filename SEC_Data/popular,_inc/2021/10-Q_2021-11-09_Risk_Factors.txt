 Item 1A. Risk Factors 

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed under &#8220;Part I - Item 1A - Risk Factors&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K and under &#8220;Part II &#8211; Item 1A - Risk Factors&#8221; of any subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position, and could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Also refer to the discussion in &#8220;Part I - Item 2 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in this report for additional information that may supplement or update the discussion of the risk factors below and in our 2020 Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 

&#160; 

The risks described in our 2020 Form 10-K and in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position. 

&#160; 

There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed under &#8220;Part I - Item 1- A - Risk Factors&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K, except for the risks included below which supplement the risk factors described in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

We are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks, that if realized, may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. These cybersecurity risks have been heightened by the increase on our employees&#8217; remote work capabilities and in the use of digital channels by our customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#160; 

Information security risks for large financial institutions such as Popular have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as Internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, hacktivists and other parties. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to transmit and store sensitive data. We employ a layered defensive approach that employs people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls through a variety of preventative and detective tools that monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity and identify suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding our defensive measures and the significant resources we devote to protect the security of our systems, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective at all times, especially as the threats from cyber-attacks is continuous and severe. T he risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future as we continue to expand our mobile banking and other internet-based product offerings and Popular&#8217;s internal use of internet-based products and applications. 

&#160; 

We continue to detect and identify attacks that are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume, as well as attackers that respond rapidly to changes in defensive countermeasures. We have been the target of phishing attacks in the past, targeting both our customers and employees through brand and email impersonation, that have compromised the email accounts of certain of our customers and employees. We continually monitor and address those vulnerabilities and continue to enhance our security measures to detect and prevent such events, while enhancing employee and customer trainings and awareness campaigns. There can be no assurances, however, that there will not be further compromises of sensitive customer information in the future. Furthermore, increased use of remote access and third-party video conferencing solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic, to facilitate work-from-home arrangements for employees, and facilitating the use of digital channels by our customers, could increase our exposure to cyber attacks. In addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by Popular&#8217;s employees. 

&#160; 

The most significant cyber-attack risks that we may face are e-fraud, denial-of-service, ransomware and computer intrusion that might result in disruption of services and in the exposure or loss of customer or proprietary data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals compromise our systems and extract funds from customer&#8217;s credit cards or bank accounts. 

&#160; 

Denial-of-service disrupts services available to our customers through our on-line banking system. Computer intrusion attempts might result in the compromise of sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, and could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs to Popular if successful. Risks and exposures related to cyber security attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as the expanding use of digital channels for banking, such as mobile banking and other technology-based products and services used by us and our customers. 

Although we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties, we have not, to date, experienced any material losses as a result of any cyber-attacks. 

&#160; 

A successful compromise or circumvention of the security of our systems could have serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations and those of our clients, customers and counterparties, misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients, customers, counterparties or employees, or damage to computers or systems used by us or by our clients, customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. For example, if personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information in our possession were to be mishandled, misused or stolen, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, Popular may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, and that damage may continue to spread. These factors may inhibit our ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information about the cyber attack to its clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack. For a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; in Part I, Item 1 &#8212; Business, included in our 2020 Form 10-K. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. 

&#160; 

We rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information security, technology and business process services. As a result, a successful compromise or circumvention of the security of the systems of these third-party service providers could have serious negative consequences for us, including misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients, customers, counterparties or employees, or other negative implications identified above with respect to a cyber attack on our systems, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The most important of these third-party service providers for us is EVERTEC, and certain risks particular to EVERTEC are discussed under &#8220;Part I - Item 1- A - Risk Factors&#8221; in our 2020 Form 10-K . During 2021, we determined that, as a result of the widely reported breach of Accellion, Inc.&#8217;s File Transfer Appliance tool, which was being used at the time of such breach by a U.S.-based third-party advisory services vendor of Popular, personal information of certain Popular customers was compromised. As a result, Popular has notified, as required or otherwise deemed appropriate, customers identified as affected by the incident. Although we are not aware of fraudulent activity in connection with this incident, Popular&#8217;s networks and systems were not impacted and our third-party service provider has agreed to cover external remediation costs associated with the incident, a compromise of the personal information of our customers maintained by third party vendors could result in significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss to us. The success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these (and other) third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner, which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties&#8217; suppliers or vendors (so-called &#8220;fourth party risk&#8221;). We may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate fourth-party risk, in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us. 

&#160; 

As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. System enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including risks associated with supply chain compromises and the software development lifecycle of the systems used by us and our service providers. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, addressing certain information security 

&#160; 

vulnerabilities, such as hardware-based vulnerabilities, may affect the performance of our information technology systems. The ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors. 

&#160; 

If Popular&#8217;s operational systems, or those of external parties on which Popular&#8217;s businesses depend, are unable to meet the requirements of our businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, Popular could be materially and adversely affected.
