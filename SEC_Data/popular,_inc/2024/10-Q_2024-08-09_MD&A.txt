Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This Form 10-Q &#160;

contains financial information &#160;

prepared under accounting &#160;

principles generally accepted in &#160;

the United States &#160;

(&#8220;U.S. 

GAAP&#8221;) and &#160;

non-GAAP financial &#160;

measures. Management &#160;

uses non-GAAP &#160;

financial measures &#160;

when it &#160;

has determined &#160;

that these 

measures provide &#160;

meaningful information &#160;

about the &#160;

underlying performance &#160;

of the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s ongoing &#160;

operations. Non-GAAP 

financial measures used by the Corporation may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by &#160;

other 

companies. 

Adjusted net income - Non-GAAP Financial Measure 

In &#160;

addition &#160;

to &#160;

analyzing &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

results &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

reported &#160;

basis, &#160;

management &#160;

monitors &#160;

the &#160;

&#8220;adjusted &#160;

net &#160;

income&#8221; &#160;

of &#160;

the 

Corporation and excludes the impact of certain transactions on the results of its operations. Management believes that the &#8220;adjusted 

net &#160;

income&#8221; &#160;

provides &#160;

meaningful &#160;

information &#160;

about &#160;

the &#160;

underlying &#160;

performance &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

ongoing &#160;

operations. &#160;

The 

&#8220;adjusted net income&#8221; is a non-GAAP financial measure. 

The &#160;

following &#160;

table &#160;

presents &#160;

the &#160;

Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis &#160;

&#8211; Non-GAAP Financial Measure 

Net interest &#160;

income on &#160;

a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis &#160;

is a &#160;

non-GAAP financial &#160;

measure. Management &#160;

believes that &#160;

this presentation 

provides meaningful information since it facilitates the comparison &#160;

of revenues arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

interest earning &#160;

assets include &#160;

investment securities &#160;

and loans &#160;

that are &#160;

exempt from &#160;

income tax, &#160;

principally in 

Puerto &#160;

Rico. The &#160;

main sources &#160;

of tax-exempt &#160;

interest income &#160;

are certain &#160;

investments in &#160;

obligations of &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. Government, &#160;

its 

agencies and &#160;

sponsored entities, &#160;

certain obligations &#160;

of the &#160;

Commonwealth of &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

and/or its &#160;

agencies and &#160;

municipalities, 

and assets &#160;

held by the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s international banking &#160;

entities. To &#160;

facilitate the comparison &#160;

of interest related &#160;

to these &#160;

assets, 

the &#160;

interest &#160;

has &#160;

been &#160;

converted &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

taxable &#160;

equivalent &#160;

basis, &#160;

using &#160;

the &#160;

applicable &#160;

statutory &#160;

income &#160;

tax &#160;

rates &#160;

for &#160;

each &#160;

period. &#160;

According to the &#160;

Puerto Rico tax &#160;

law, a &#160;

portion of interest &#160;

cost, based on &#160;

an equal proportion &#160;

of tax-exempt assets to &#160;

total assets, 

and an &#160;

allocation of &#160;

general and &#160;

administrative expenses &#160;

should be &#160;

attributed to &#160;

exempt income, &#160;

reducing the &#160;

benefit of &#160;

the tax 

exempt income, and as such &#160;

the disallowance of such &#160;

deduction is considered in the &#160;

taxable equivalent computation. The effective 

yield, on &#160;

a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis, will &#160;

vary depending on &#160;

the level &#160;

of these expenses &#160;

that are &#160;

attributed to the &#160;

available exempt 

income. 

Net interest income on &#160;

a taxable equivalent basis, &#160;

with its different components, &#160;

along with the reconciliation to &#160;

net interest income 

(GAAP), for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023, segregated by major categories of interest 

earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are &#160;

included in Table 3 of the Operating Results Analysis section below.

Financial highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 

&#9679;

&#160;

For the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2024, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

recorded net &#160;

income of &#160;

$ 177.8 &#160;

million, compared &#160;

to net &#160;

income of &#160;

$ 

151.2 &#160;

million for &#160;

the same &#160;

quarter of &#160;

the &#160;

previous year. &#160;

Net interest &#160;

margin for &#160;

the second &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2024 &#160;

was 3.22%, &#160;

an 

increase of 8 basis points when compared to 3.14% for the same quarter of the previous year. &#160;

The increase was mainly due to 

the reinvestment of maturities in higher yielding &#160;

U.S. Treasury bills and due &#160;

to higher average loan balances and &#160;

higher yields 

in all &#160;

loans portfolios, &#160;

which was partially &#160;

offset by &#160;

higher deposit &#160;

costs, principally &#160;

due to &#160;

higher average volume &#160;

and higher 

cost &#160;

of &#160;

interest-bearing &#160;

deposits &#160;

and &#160;

time &#160;

deposits. &#160;

On &#160;

a &#160;

taxable &#160;

equivalent &#160;

basis, &#160;

the &#160;

net &#160;

interest &#160;

margin &#160;

was &#160;

3.48%, 

compared to 3.29% for the same quarter of &#160;

the previous year. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

For &#160;

the &#160;

quarter &#160;

ended June &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation recorded &#160;

a &#160;

provision for &#160;

credit &#160;

losses &#160;

of &#160;

$46.8 million, &#160;

compared &#160;

to 

$37.2 million for the same quarter of the previous year. &#160;

The increase in provision for credit losses was driven by loan growth in 

BPPR and &#160;

higher reserves &#160;

in the &#160;

auto leasing &#160;

portfolio resulting &#160;

from recent &#160;

loss history, &#160;

partially offset &#160;

by lower &#160;

reserves in 

the PB commercial portfolio mainly due to improvements &#160;

in credit ratings. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Non-interest income was $166.3 &#160;

million for the &#160;

quarter, &#160;

an increase of $5.8 &#160;

million when compared to &#160;

the quarter ended June 

30, 2023, mainly &#160;

due to higher &#160;

income from mortgage banking &#160;

activities resulting from the &#160;

fair value adjustments &#160;

of mortgage 

servicing rights and higher other service fees. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Operating expenses of $469.6 million for the quarter were higher by $9.3 million when compared to the quarter ended June 30, 

2023

. &#160;

Higher &#160;

operating &#160;

expenses &#160;

were &#160;

driven &#160;

mainly &#160;

by &#160;

higher &#160;

technology &#160;

and &#160;

software &#160;

expenses, &#160;

personnel &#160;

costs, &#160;

other 

operating expenses, &#160;

FDIC deposit insurance expense and processing &#160;

and transactional services expenses. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Income tax expense during the quarter was lower &#160;

by $3.0 million mainly due to higher exempt &#160;

income and other tax credits. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Total &#160;

assets at June &#160;

30, 2024 amounted to &#160;

$72.8 billion, compared to &#160;

$70.8 billion, at &#160;

December 31, 2023. &#160;

The increase was 

driven by &#160;

an increase &#160;

in available-for-sale &#160;

(&#8220;AFS&#8221;) investment &#160;

securities, mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

purchases of &#160;

U.S. Treasury &#160;

bills and 

loan growth, mainly in &#160;

the commercial portfolio, &#160;

partially offset by a &#160;

decrease in held-to-maturity (&#8220;HTM&#8221;) investment &#160;

securities 

driven by maturities of U.S. Treasury securities. 

&#9679;

Total &#160;

deposits at June 30, 2024 increased by &#160;

$1.9 billion when compared to deposits at &#160;

December 31, 2023, mainly due to &#160;

an 

increase in Puerto Rico public sector deposits and higher &#160;

deposits in PB, mainly those captured via the online channel.

&#9679;

&#160;

Stockholders&#8217; equity as &#160;

of June 30, &#160;

2024 increased by &#160;

$225.7 million from &#160;

the December 31, &#160;

2023, mainly due &#160;

to net income 

for the six &#160;

months ended June &#160;

30, 2023 of &#160;

$281.1 million and &#160;

the amortization of unrealized &#160;

losses from securities &#160;

previously 

reclassified to &#160;

held-to-maturity (&#8220;HTM&#8221;) of &#160;

$70.7 million, &#160;

net of &#160;

taxes, partially &#160;

offset by &#160;

the after-tax &#160;

impact of &#160;

the increase &#160;

in 

net unrealized &#160;

losses in &#160;

the portfolio &#160;

of AFS &#160;

securities of &#160;

$54.2 million and &#160;

common and &#160;

preferred dividends declared &#160;

during 

the &#160;

period of &#160;

$90.4 million. &#160;

As &#160;

of &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2024, the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s tangible &#160;

book value &#160;

per common &#160;

share was &#160;

$62.71, an 

increase of $2.97 from December 31, 2023. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Regulatory capital ratios remain strong. At June 30, 2024, the Corporation&#8217;s common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 16.48%, the 

tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.53%, and the &#160;

total capital ratio was 18.30%. Refer to Table 9 for capital ratios.

within this &#160;

MD&#38;A for &#160;

additional discussion &#160;

of significant 

quarterly variances and items impacting the financial performance &#160;

of the Corporation. 

As a financial services company, &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s earnings are significantly affected &#160;

by general business and economic conditions 

in the &#160;

markets which &#160;

we serve. &#160;

Lending and &#160;

deposit activities &#160;

and fee &#160;

income generation &#160;

are influenced &#160;

by the &#160;

level of &#160;

business 

spending and &#160;

investment, consumer &#160;

income, spending &#160;

and savings, &#160;

capital market &#160;

activities, competition, &#160;

customer preferences, 

interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates &#160;

on competing products. 

The Corporation &#160;

operates in &#160;

a highly &#160;

regulated environment &#160;

and may &#160;

be adversely &#160;

affected by &#160;

changes in &#160;

federal and &#160;

local laws 

and &#160;

regulations. &#160;

Also, &#160;

competition &#160;

with &#160;

other &#160;

financial &#160;

institutions, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

with &#160;

non-traditional financial &#160;

service &#160;

providers &#160;

and 

technology &#160;

companies &#160;

that &#160;

provide &#160;

electronic &#160;

and &#160;

internet-based &#160;

financial &#160;

solutions &#160;

and &#160;

services, &#160;

could &#160;

adversely &#160;

affect &#160;

its 

profitability. 

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

continuously &#160;

monitors &#160;

general &#160;

business &#160;

and &#160;

economic &#160;

conditions, &#160;

industry-related &#160;

indicators &#160;

and &#160;

trends, 

competition, interest rate volatility, credit &#160;

quality indicators, loan and deposit demand, operational and systems efficiencies, &#160;

OPERATING RESULTS ANALYSIS 

NET INTEREST INCOME 

Net interest &#160;

income for &#160;

the quarter &#160;

ended June &#160;

30, 2024 &#160;

was $568.3 &#160;

million, compared &#160;

to &#160;

$531.7 million &#160;

in the &#160;

same quarter &#160;

of 

2023, an &#160;

increase of &#160;

$36.6 million. &#160;

Net interest &#160;

income on &#160;

a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis &#160;

for the &#160;

second quarter &#160;

of 2024 &#160;

was $614.8 

million compared to $558.4 million in the second quarter &#160;

of 2023, an increase of $56.4 million. &#160;

Net interest margin for the quarter was 3.22% compared to 3.14% &#160;

in the second quarter of 2023 or an increase of eight basis &#160;

points. 

On a &#160;

taxable &#160;

equivalent basis, &#160;

net interest &#160;

margin for &#160;

the second &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2024 was &#160;

3.48%, compared &#160;

to &#160;

3.29% for &#160;

the same 

quarter the prior year. The main variances in net interest income on &#160;

a taxable equivalent basis were: &#160;

&#9679;

higher interest income from investment securities by $80.5 million mainly driven by higher volume by $1.6 billion driven by 

the deployment of liquidity to invest in short-term treasury bills, whose interest is tax exempt in Puerto Rico. Also, a higher 

yield by 101 basis points, &#160;

driven by a higher interest rate environment and reinvestment of investment maturities in higher 

yielding U.S. Treasury bills; 

&#9679;

higher interest &#160;

income from &#160;

loans by &#160;

$79.6 million &#160;

resulting from &#160;

an increase &#160;

in average &#160;

loans by &#160;

$2.7 billion &#160;

reflecting 

loan &#160;

increases &#160;

in &#160;

both &#160;

PB &#160;

and &#160;

BPPR &#160;

and &#160;

across &#160;

most &#160;

portfolios &#160;

and &#160;

higher &#160;

yield &#160;

on &#160;

loans &#160;

by &#160;

37 &#160;

basis &#160;

points &#160;

when 

compared to the same quarter of 2023 due to origination of loans in &#160;

a higher interest rate environment and the repricing of 

adjustable-rate loans. The portfolio with the highest variances included commercial loans with an increase of $38.1 million 

in interest income, or 34 basis points. Mortgage loans, auto loans and consumer loans increased approximately $9 million 

each in &#160;

interest income, &#160;

while construction &#160;

loans increased &#160;

$7.8 million. &#160;

All loan &#160;

portfolios showed &#160;

increases in &#160;

volume 

and yield 

Partially offset by: 

&#9679;

higher interest &#160;

expense on &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$96.5 million &#160;

driven by &#160;

higher cost &#160;

of deposits &#160;

by 65 &#160;

basis points &#160;

due to &#160;

higher 

average volume and higher cost of market linked interest-bearing &#160;

P.R. &#160;

public deposits by $2.1 billion and higher volume of 

U.S. deposits, mainly those captured via the online &#160;

channel. 

Net interest income for the BPPR segment amounted to $488.7 &#160;

million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $453.1 &#160;

million in 

the second quarter of 2023. Net interest margin increased to 3.40% &#160;

compared to 3.21% in the second quarter of 2023. The increase 

in net interest income of $35.6 million was &#160;

driven by higher yield and volume of earning assets &#160;

partially offset by the increase in the 

cost of deposits, &#160;

mainly from the &#160;

P.R. &#160;

public sector. &#160;

The cost of &#160;

interest-bearing deposits increased 52 &#160;

basis points to &#160;

2.47% from 

1.95% &#160;

in the &#160;

same &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2023. Total &#160;

deposit costs &#160;

for &#160;

the quarter &#160;

increased by &#160;

39 basis &#160;

points, from &#160;

1.44% in &#160;

the second 

quarter of 2023 to 1.83%. 

&#160;

Net interest &#160;

income for &#160;

PB was &#160;

$85.9 million &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2024, compared &#160;

to $87.5 &#160;

million during &#160;

the second 

quarter &#160;

of &#160;

2023, &#160;

a &#160;

decrease &#160;

of &#160;

$1.6 &#160;

million. &#160;

Net &#160;

interest margin &#160;

decreased &#160;

41 &#160;

basis &#160;

points &#160;

to &#160;

2.60% &#160;

when compared &#160;

to &#160;

3.01% 

during the second quarter of 2023. The decrease in net interest margin was mostly driven by a higher cost of deposits in all interest-

bearing categories, partially offset by the increase in loan volume and the repricing of adjustable-rate loans driven by the changes in 

interest rates. The cost of interest-bearing deposits was 3.89% compared to &#160;

3.02% in the second quarter of 2023, or &#160;

an increase of 

87 basis points, while total deposit cost was &#160;

3.43% compared to 2.55% in the second quarter &#160;

of 2023.

Note: The changes that are not due solely to volume or &#160;

rate are allocated to volume and rate based on the &#160;

proportion of the change in each category. 

[1] Average balances exclude unrealized gains or losses &#160;

on debt securities available-for-sale and the unrealized &#160;

loss related to certain securities transferred from 

available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. 

[2] Includes interest bearing demand deposits corresponding &#160;

to certain government entities in Puerto Rico. 

Net interest income for &#160;

the six-month period ended &#160;

June 30, 2024 &#160;

was $1.1 billion, &#160;

or $55.7 million higher &#160;

than the same &#160;

period in 

2023. Taxable &#160;

equivalent net &#160;

interest income &#160;

was $1.2 &#160;

billion, an &#160;

increase of &#160;

$75.6 million &#160;

when compared &#160;

to the &#160;

same period &#160;

in 

2023. Net interest margin &#160;

was 3.20%, an increase &#160;

of 2 basis &#160;

points when compared to &#160;

3.18% in 2023. The &#160;

increase in net interest 

margin &#160;

was &#160;

mainly &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

a &#160;

higher &#160;

yield &#160;

on &#160;

earning &#160;

assets &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

reinvestment &#160;

of &#160;

investment &#160;

securities &#160;

maturities, 

adjustable-rate loans &#160;

and higher volume &#160;

of earning &#160;

assets in &#160;

a higher interest &#160;

rate environment. Net &#160;

interest margin, &#160;

on a &#160;

taxable 

equivalent basis, for &#160;

the six months &#160;

ended June 30, &#160;

2024, was 3.44%, &#160;

an increase of &#160;

7 basis points when &#160;

compared to the &#160;

3.37% 

for the same period of 2023. The drivers of &#160;

the variances in net interest income for the &#160;

six-month period are: &#160;

Positive variances: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher interest &#160;

income from &#160;

investment securities &#160;

by &#160;

$112.7 &#160;

million resulting &#160;

from &#160;

higher yield &#160;

of the &#160;

portfolio by &#160;

75 basis 

points &#160;

driven by &#160;

the re-investment &#160;

of &#160;

maturities and &#160;

deployment of &#160;

liquidity to &#160;

higher yield &#160;

short-term treasury &#160;

bills, &#160;

whose 

interest is tax exempt in Puerto Rico; 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher interest income from commercial loans by $92.1 million due to higher yield by 43 basis points related to higher rates in 

adjustable rate loans and higher volume of $1.7 &#160;

billion, increasing in BPPR and PB; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher interest income from consumer loans &#160;

by $25.4 million and auto &#160;

loans by $20.4 million mostly due &#160;

to a higher average 

yield and volume of &#160;

personal loans and credit cards &#160;

driven by the increase in &#160;

market rates of approximately 150 &#160;

basis points 

throughout 2023. 

Partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher interest expense from deposits by &#160;

$232.7 million mainly due to the &#160;

increase in interest rates that has &#160;

resulted in a 

higher cost in &#160;

most deposit categories &#160;

in both BPPR &#160;

and PB; but &#160;

particularly from Puerto &#160;

Rico government deposits &#160;

that 

are market-linked and PB online deposits.

Provision for Credit Losses - Loans Held-in-Portfolio &#160;

and Unfunded Commitments 

For &#160;

the quarter &#160;

ended June &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

recorded a &#160;

provision expense &#160;

of &#160;

$46.3 million &#160;

for credit &#160;

losses related &#160;

to 

loans held-in-portfolio &#160;

and unfunded &#160;

commitments. The &#160;

provision for &#160;

loan losses &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2024 was &#160;

$44.2 

million, compared &#160;

to &#160;

a provision &#160;

expense of &#160;

$35.7 million &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2023. The &#160;

reserve related &#160;

to unfunded 

commitments for the second quarter &#160;

of 2024 was $2.1 million, &#160;

compared to a provision &#160;

expense of $2.2 million for &#160;

the same period 

of 2023. The drivers of the variance &#160;

in the provision for loan losses by &#160;

business segments when comparing the quarter ended June 

30, 2024, to the same quarter in 2023 were as &#160;

follows: 

&#9679;

&#160;

In the &#160;

BPPR segment, &#160;

a higher &#160;

provision expense &#160;

was recorded &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2024 of &#160;

$48.6 million, 

compared to &#160;

a provision &#160;

expense of &#160;

$28.4 million &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2023, driven &#160;

by loan &#160;

growth in &#160;

BPPR 

and higher reserves in our auto leasing portfolio &#160;

resulting from recent loss history. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

In the Popular U.S. segment, &#160;

a release of $4.4 million &#160;

was recorded for the quarter &#160;

ended June 30, 2024, compared to &#160;

a 

provision expense of $7.3 million for the same quarter &#160;

in 2023, driven by improvements in commercial credit ratings &#160;

in PB. 

For the &#160;

six months &#160;

ended June &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

recorded a &#160;

provision for &#160;

credit loss &#160;

of $118.4 &#160;

million for &#160;

its reserve &#160;

for 

credit losses related to loans held-in-portfolio and unfunded commitments. The &#160;

provision for loan losses expense for the six &#160;

months 

ended June &#160;

30, 2024 &#160;

was $116.5 &#160;

million, compared &#160;

to an &#160;

expense of &#160;

$82.8 million &#160;

for the &#160;

six months &#160;

ended June &#160;

30, 2023. &#160;

The 

provision for &#160;

unfunded commitments for &#160;

the six &#160;

months ended June &#160;

30, 2024 &#160;

reflected an &#160;

expense of &#160;

$1.9 million, &#160;

compared to &#160;

a 

provision expense of $2.8 million for the same period &#160;

of 2023. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

In the BPPR &#160;

segment, the provision for &#160;

loan losses was an &#160;

expense of $109.6 million &#160;

for the six &#160;

months ended June 30, 

2024, compared to an expense of $73.6 million for &#160;

the six months ended June 30, 2023, attributable to higher reserves &#160;

in 

our auto &#160;

leasing portfolio &#160;

mostly due &#160;

to the &#160;

recent loss &#160;

history and &#160;

changes in &#160;

the credit &#160;

quality of &#160;

the BPPR &#160;

consumer 

portfolio. 

&#9679;

&#160;

In the Popular U.S. segment, &#160;

the provision for loan losses &#160;

was an expense of $7.0 &#160;

million for the six months &#160;

ended June 

30, 2024, &#160;

compared to &#160;

an expense &#160;

of &#160;

$9.2 million &#160;

for the &#160;

same &#160;

period in &#160;

2023. The &#160;

lower provision &#160;

was driven &#160;

by an 

improvement in commercial credit ratings in PB. 

At June &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

the total &#160;

allowance for &#160;

credit losses &#160;

for loans &#160;

held-in-portfolio amounted to &#160;

$730.1 million, &#160;

compared to &#160;

$729.3 

million as of December 31, 2023. &#160;

The ratio of the allowance for &#160;

credit losses to loans held-in-portfolio was &#160;

2.05% at June 30, 2024, 

compared &#160;

to &#160;

2.08% &#160;

at &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2023. &#160;

Non-Interest Income 

Non-interest &#160;

income &#160;

amounted to &#160;

$166.3 &#160;

million &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

June &#160;

30, &#160;

2024, compared &#160;

to &#160;

$160.5 &#160;

million &#160;

for the &#160;

same 

quarter of the previous year. The main factors that contributed to the variance &#160;

in non-interest income were: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

income &#160;

from &#160;

mortgage &#160;

banking &#160;

activities &#160;

by &#160;

$3.4 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

fair &#160;

value &#160;

adjustments of &#160;

mortgage &#160;

servicing 

rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;); and &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other service fees &#160;

by $2.6 million mainly &#160;

due to higher debit &#160;

card service fees as &#160;

a result of higher volume &#160;

of costumer 

transactions. 

Non-interest income amounted to &#160;

$330.1 million for &#160;

the six months ended &#160;

June 30, 2024, &#160;

compared to $322.4 million &#160;

for the same 

period of the previous year. The main factors that contributed to the &#160;

variance in non-interest income were: &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other service fees &#160;

by $6.8 million mainly due &#160;

to an increase in &#160;

debit cards transactional volume related fee &#160;

income and 

higher credit card fees as a result of higher interchange &#160;

transactional volumes; &#160;

and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

service &#160;

charges &#160;

on &#160;

deposit &#160;

accounts &#160;

by &#160;

$2.5 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

fees &#160;

resulting &#160;

mainly &#160;

from &#160;

non-balance 

compensation in commercial deposits. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses amounted to &#160;

$469.6 million for &#160;

the quarter ended &#160;

June 30, 2024, &#160;

an increase of &#160;

$9.3 million, when &#160;

compared 

with the same quarter of 2023. The variance &#160;

in operating expenses was driven primarily by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher technology &#160;

and software &#160;

expenses &#160;

by &#160;

$7.4 million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

higher IT &#160;

professional and &#160;

consulting &#160;

fees &#160;

by &#160;

$3.4 

million and higher software amortization expense by &#160;

$2.5 million; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher personnel costs by $6.0 million mainly due to higher &#160;

salaries by $3.7 million as a result of annual salary &#160;

revisions and an 

increase in headcount, and higher commissions and &#160;

incentive compensation by $3.4 million; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other &#160;

operating expenses &#160;

by $4.7 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

build up &#160;

on reserves &#160;

for operational &#160;

losses, &#160;

partially offset &#160;

by 

lower pension plan costs as a result of annual &#160;

changes in actuarial assumptions; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher FDIC deposit insurance expense by $3.8 &#160;

million mainly due to higher average total assets; &#160;

and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher processing and transactional services expenses by $2.3 million mainly due to &#160;

higher credit card processing related fees 

as a result of higher volume of transactions; 

partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower professional &#160;

fees by &#160;

$12.4 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to lower &#160;

advisory expenses &#160;

arising from &#160;

corporate initiatives &#160;

focused on 

regulatory, compliance and cyber security efforts, as well as those related to the Corporation's &#160;

transformation initiative; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other real estate owned (OREO) benefit &#160;

by $2.4 million mainly due to higher gain &#160;

on sale of commercial properties. 

Operating &#160;

expenses &#160;

amounted &#160;

to &#160;

$952.7 &#160;

million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

six &#160;

months &#160;

ended &#160;

June &#160;

30, &#160;

2024, &#160;

an &#160;

increase &#160;

of &#160;

$51.7 &#160;

million &#160;

when 

compared with the &#160;

same period of &#160;

2023. Excluding the &#160;

$6.4 million of &#160;

interest accrued related &#160;

to prior period &#160;

tax withholdings and 

the $14.3 million impact of the &#160;

FDIC Special Assessment, total expenses for six &#160;

months ended June 30, 2024, were &#160;

$932.0 million, 

an increase of $31.0 million, when compared &#160;

with the same period of 2023. The main drivers &#160;

of the $31.0 million variance were: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

personnel &#160;

costs &#160;

by &#160;

$22.6 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher salaries &#160;

expense by &#160;

$7.7 &#160;

million &#160;

as &#160;

a &#160;

result &#160;

of &#160;

annual salary 

revisions &#160;

and &#160;

an &#160;

increase &#160;

in &#160;

headcount, &#160;

higher &#160;

commissions &#160;

and &#160;

incentive &#160;

compensation &#160;

by &#160;

$7.3 &#160;

million, &#160;

an &#160;

increase &#160;

in 

restricted stock expense by $2.8 million, and higher payroll &#160;

taxes by $2.1 million; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher technology and software expenses by $18.3 million mainly &#160;

due to higher software amortization expense by $5.7 million, 

higher IT professional fees &#160;

by $5.3 million, &#160;

an increase of $4.8 &#160;

million from network management &#160;

services and an increase &#160;

of 

$1.9 million in application processing and hosting &#160;

services; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other &#160;

operating expenses &#160;

by $8.6 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

build up &#160;

on reserves &#160;

for operational &#160;

losses; partially &#160;

offset by 

lower pension plan costs as a result of annual &#160;

changes in actuarial assumptions; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher processing and transactional services expenses by $2.6 million mainly due higher credit card processing related fees as 

a result of higher volume of transactions; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher business &#160;

promotion expenses &#160;

by $2.5 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

higher customer &#160;

rewards programs &#160;

expense in &#160;

our credit 

card business; 

partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower professional &#160;

fees by &#160;

$16.9 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to lower &#160;

advisory expenses &#160;

arising from &#160;

corporate initiatives &#160;

focused on 

regulatory, compliance and cyber security efforts, as well as those related to the Corporation's &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other real estate &#160;

$6.1 million mainly due &#160;

to higher gain on &#160;

sale of mortgage and &#160;

properties and a reduction in corporate advances &#160;

on mortgage loans.

Income Taxes 

For the quarter &#160;

and six months &#160;

ended June 30, &#160;

2024, the Corporation recorded &#160;

an income tax &#160;

expense of $40.5 &#160;

million and $96.0 

million with &#160;

an effective tax &#160;

rate (ETR) of &#160;

19% and 26%, &#160;

respectively, compared &#160;

to $43.5 million &#160;

and $89.8 million &#160;

with an ETR &#160;

of 

22% and 24% for the respective periods of 2023. &#160;

The variance in income tax expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, reflects 

the &#160;

impact of &#160;

higher exempt &#160;

income and &#160;

other tax &#160;

credits when &#160;

compared to &#160;

the same &#160;

quarter of &#160;

year &#160;

2023. For &#160;

the six-month 

period ended June 30, &#160;

2024, the higher income &#160;

tax reflects the tax withholding &#160;

expense recorded during the first &#160;

quarter on certain 

intercompany distributions, amounting to $22.9 million, out of which $16.5 million corresponded to years 2014-2023 and $6.5 million 

was related &#160;

to a &#160;

distribution completed during &#160;

the period &#160;

ended March &#160;

31, 2024; &#160;

this negative variance &#160;

was partially &#160;

offset by &#160;

the 

higher exempt income and other tax credits recorded this &#160;

year, compared with the same period of year 2023. Based on the Adjusted 

Net Income, as &#160;

defined in the &#160;

non-GAAP Financial Measures &#160;

section of &#160;

this MD&#38;A, the &#160;

ETR for &#160;

the six-month period &#160;

ended June 

30, 2024, would have &#160;

been 21.3%. Refer to the &#160;

Non- GAAP Financial Measures section in &#160;

this MD&#38;A for more &#160;

details on Adjusted 

Net Income. 

At June 30, 2024, the Corporation had a net deferred tax asset amounting to $1.0 billion, net of a valuation allowance of $0.5 billion. 

The net deferred tax asset related to the U.S. &#160;

operations was $0.3 billion, net of &#160;

a valuation allowance of $0.4 billion. 

Refer to &#160;

REPORTABLE SEGMENT RESULTS 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

reportable segments &#160;

for managerial &#160;

reporting purposes &#160;

consist of &#160;

Banco Popular &#160;

de Puerto &#160;

Rico and &#160;

Popular 

U.S. A Corporate group &#160;

has also been defined to support the reportable &#160;

segments. &#160;

&#160;

For &#160;

a &#160;

description &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

reportable &#160;

segments, &#160;

including &#160;

additional &#160;

financial &#160;

information &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

underlying 

management accounting process, refer to Note 32 &#160;

to the Consolidated Financial Statements. &#160;

The Corporate group reported a net income of $3.8 million for the quarter &#160;

ended June 30, 2024, compared with a net income of $4.7 

million for the same quarter of the previous year. &#160;

For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Corporate group reported net &#160;

loss of 

$21.6 million, compared to a net &#160;

income of $6.0 million for the &#160;

same period of the previous year. &#160;

The negative variance was mainly 

attributed to the $22.9 million adjustment to recognize the tax impact associated with prior period intercompany distributions and the 

additional $6.5 million recognized for the tax &#160;

impact related to intercompany distributions paid &#160;

during the first quarter of 2024. &#160;

Highlights on the earnings results for the reportable &#160;

segments are discussed below: 

Banco Popular de Puerto Rico &#160;

The Banco &#160;

Popular de &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

reportable segment&#8217;s &#160;

net income &#160;

amounted to &#160;

$157.2 million &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

June 30, 

2024, compared &#160;

with net &#160;

income of &#160;

$131.8 million &#160;

for the &#160;

same quarter &#160;

of &#160;

the previous &#160;

year. &#160;

The factors &#160;

that contributed &#160;

to the 

variance in the financial results included the following: &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher net interest income by $35.7 million mainly &#160;

due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income from money market and investment &#160;

securities by $33.8 million due to higher yields driven 

by &#160;

the &#160;

increase &#160;

in &#160;

interest &#160;

rates &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Federal &#160;

Reserve &#160;

and &#160;

higher &#160;

average &#160;

balances &#160;

of &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Treasury 

securities; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income from loans by $58.2 million mainly &#160;

due to higher average balances from commercial and 

consumer loans, reflected in auto loans, credit cards &#160;

and personal loans; 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

expense on &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$56.2 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

costs &#160;

on the &#160;

market-linked Puerto 

Rico &#160;

government &#160;

deposits, &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

higher &#160;

interest &#160;

rate &#160;

environment&#8217;s &#160;

impact &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

cost &#160;

of &#160;

interest-bearing 

demand accounts and time deposits. 

The &#160;

net &#160;

interest &#160;

margin &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

quarter &#160;

ended &#160;

June &#160;

30, &#160;

2024 &#160;

was &#160;

3.40% &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

3.21% &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

same &#160;

quarter &#160;

in &#160;

the 

previous year. &#160;

The increase in &#160;

net interest margin &#160;

is driven by &#160;

the earnings assets &#160;

mix and the &#160;

higher yields from &#160;

investment 

securities and loans, particularly commercial and consumer loans, due to the increase in rates; partially offset by &#160;

higher cost of 

deposits.

&#9679;

&#160;

A provision &#160;

for loan &#160;

losses expense of &#160;

$50.4 million, compared &#160;

to a &#160;

provision expense of &#160;

$29.3 million in &#160;

quarter ended 

June &#160;

30, &#160;

2023, &#160;

or &#160;

an &#160;

unfavorable &#160;

variance &#160;

of &#160;

$21.0 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

higher &#160;

reserves &#160;

in &#160;

auto &#160;

leasing &#160;

portfolio 

mostly due to the recent loss history and loan &#160;

growth; &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Non-interest income was higher by $8.5 million mainly &#160;

due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

income &#160;

from &#160;

mortgage &#160;

banking &#160;

activities &#160;

by &#160;

$3.4 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

favorable &#160;

variance &#160;

of &#160;

$4.3 

million in the fair value adjustment of mortgage service &#160;

rights; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other &#160;

service fees &#160;

by $2.5 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to &#160;

higher debit &#160;

card &#160;

fees as &#160;

result of &#160;

higher volumes &#160;

of 

customer transactions; &#160;

and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other &#160;

operating income &#160;

by $2.0 &#160;

million mostly &#160;

due to &#160;

a realized gain &#160;

resulting from &#160;

previously acquired 

mortgage portfolios; 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher operating expenses by $1.6 million mostly &#160;

due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other operating expense &#160;

by $5.4 million mostly &#160;

due to reserves for &#160;

operational losses; partially offset &#160;

by 

lower pension plan expense as a result of &#160;

annual changes in actuarial assumptions; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

processing &#160;

and &#160;

transactional &#160;

services &#160;

by &#160;

$2.3 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

credit &#160;

card &#160;

processing 

expense as result of higher customer transactional &#160;

volumes; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher personnel costs by $3.8 million driven by &#160;

higher annual salary revisions, &#160;

and increase in headcount; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher FDIC deposit insurance expense by $2.2 &#160;

million due to higher average total assets; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher technology &#160;

and software &#160;

expenses by &#160;

$1.5 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

IT professional &#160;

and consulting 

fees, higher amortization of software costs and higher &#160;

network management fees; 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower professional fees of $11.2 million mainly related to corporate initiatives focused on regulatory, &#160;

compliance 

and cyber security efforts as well the Corporations &#160;

transformation initiatives; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

recoveries &#160;

from &#160;

OREO &#160;

by &#160;

$2.5 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

an &#160;

increase &#160;

in &#160;

gain &#160;

on &#160;

sale &#160;

of &#160;

commercial 

properties; 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower income tax expense by $3.8 million is &#160;

mainly due to higher net exempt income. &#160;

For the &#160;

six months &#160;

ended June 30, &#160;

2024, the BPPR &#160;

segment recorded net &#160;

income of $278.5 &#160;

million compared to &#160;

a net &#160;

income of 

$264.7 million for the &#160;

same period of the &#160;

previous year. The &#160;

factors that contributed to the &#160;

variance in the financial &#160;

results included 

the following: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher net interest income by $58.7 million &#160;

mainly due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income from money market and investment &#160;

securities by $72.5 million due to higher yields driven 

by the &#160;

re-investments of &#160;

maturities and &#160;

deployment of &#160;

liquidity to &#160;

higher yield &#160;

short-term treasury &#160;

bills, whose 

interest is tax exempt in Puerto Rico. 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

income from &#160;

loans by &#160;

$129.4 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

average balances &#160;

from commercial 

and consumer loans, 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

expense on &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$143.0 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

costs on &#160;

the market-linked &#160;

Puerto 

Rico &#160;

government &#160;

deposits, &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

higher &#160;

interest &#160;

rate &#160;

environment&#8217;s &#160;

impact &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

cost &#160;

of &#160;

interest-bearing 

demand accounts, time deposits, and savings deposits. 

The net interest margin for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was 3.36% compared to 3.26% for the same quarter in the previous 

year. The &#160;

increase in net &#160;

interest margin is driven &#160;

by the earnings assets &#160;

mix and the &#160;

higher yields from &#160;

investment securities and 

loans, particularly commercial and consumer loans, &#160;

due to the increase in rates; partially offset by &#160;

higher cost of deposits. 

&#9679;

&#160;

A unfavorable variance of &#160;

$36.0 million on the &#160;

provision for loan losses &#160;

mainly attributable to &#160;

higher reserves in our &#160;

auto 

leasing portfolio and changes in credit quality &#160;

mostly due to consumer portfolios; &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Non-interest income was higher by $6.7 million &#160;

mainly due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other service fees &#160;

by $5.1 million mainly due &#160;

to higher debit card &#160;

fees by $3.8 million &#160;

as result of higher 

volume of customer transactions; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher service charges on deposit accounts by &#160;

$2.7 million mainly due to higher no balance &#160;

compensation. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher operating expenses by $33.0 million mostly due &#160;

to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher personnel costs by $15.3 million driven by &#160;

higher annual salary revisions and increase in &#160;

headcount;

from &#160;

higher &#160;

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower professional fees of $11.5 &#160;

costs associated with several initiatives focused on 

regulatory, compliance and cyber security efforts as well as the transformation initiative; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher net &#160;

recoveries from &#160;

recorded 

during this period. 

Popular U.S. 

For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the reportable segment of Popular U.S. reported a net income of $17.7 million, compared with 

a net income &#160;

of $15.3 million for &#160;

the same quarter of &#160;

the previous year. &#160;

The factors that contributed &#160;

to the variance &#160;

in the financial 

results included the following: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower &#160;

net interest income by $1.7 million due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

expense on &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$36.0 million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher interest &#160;

rates &#160;

and &#160;

higher average 

balance; 

partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

income from &#160;

loans by &#160;

$20.4 million, &#160;

mainly from &#160;

growth in &#160;

the commercial &#160;

portfolio as &#160;

well as 

higher yields due to increase in rates; &#160;

and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income from money market and investment &#160;

securities by $13.5 million due to higher yields. 

The net &#160;

interest margin for &#160;

the quarter &#160;

ended June &#160;

30, 2024 &#160;

was 2.60% &#160;

compared to &#160;

3.01% for &#160;

the same &#160;

quarter in &#160;

the previous 

year driven by the higher cost of deposits. 

&#9679;

&#160;

An favorable variance of &#160;

$11.5 million &#160;

on the provision for &#160;

loan losses and unfunded commitments &#160;

reflecting a release of 

the reserve &#160;

for credit &#160;

losses of &#160;

$3.6 million &#160;

for the &#160;

second quarter &#160;

of &#160;

2024 mostly &#160;

due to &#160;

improvements in &#160;

commercial 

credit ratings, &#160;

compared to a provision expense of $7.9 million &#160;

recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2023; 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher operating expenses by $6.3 million mostly &#160;

due to: &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other &#160;

operating expense &#160;

by &#160;

$3.3 million &#160;

due to &#160;

higher charges &#160;

allocated from &#160;

the &#160;

Corporate segment 

group by $1.6 million mainly from higher personnel costs &#160;

and higher consulting fees. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher income tax expense by $1.1 million is &#160;

related to higher income before tax. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the reportable segment of Popular &#160;

U.S. recorded a net income of $24.8 million, compared 

with &#160;

a &#160;

net &#160;

income &#160;

of &#160;

$40.3 &#160;

million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

same &#160;

period &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

previous &#160;

year. &#160;

The &#160;

factors &#160;

that &#160;

contributed &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

variance &#160;

in &#160;

the 

financial results included the following: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower net interest income by $6.9 million due &#160;

to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

expense on &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$87.3 million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher interest &#160;

rates &#160;

and &#160;

higher average 

balance; 

partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

income from &#160;

loans by &#160;

$46.8 million, &#160;

mainly from &#160;

growth in &#160;

the commercial &#160;

portfolio as &#160;

well as 

higher yields due to increase in rates; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income &#160;

from money market &#160;

and investment securities &#160;

by $31.7 million &#160;

due to higher &#160;

yields and 

higher average balance. 

The net interest margin for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was 2.60% compared to 3.17% for the same quarter in the previous 

year. 

&#9679;

&#160;

An &#160;

favorable &#160;

variance &#160;

of &#160;

$2.1 &#160;

provision &#160;

for &#160;

loan &#160;

losses &#160;

and &#160;

unfunded &#160;

commitments &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

an 

improvement in credit quality; 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher operating expenses by $10.9 million mostly due &#160;

to: &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other &#160;

operating expense &#160;

by &#160;

$4.9 million &#160;

due to &#160;

higher charges &#160;

allocated from &#160;

the &#160;

Corporate segment 

group by $3.4 million, mainly from higher &#160;

personnel costs. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher income &#160;

tax expense &#160;

by $0.6 &#160;

million due &#160;

to a &#160;

FINANCIAL CONDITION ANALYSIS &#160;

Assets 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

total assets &#160;

were $72.8 &#160;

billion at &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2024, compared to &#160;

$70.8 billion &#160;

at December &#160;

31, 2023. &#160;

in this report for additional information. &#160;

Money market investments and debt securities available-for-sale 

Money market &#160;

investments decreased &#160;

by &#160;

$147.5 million &#160;

as &#160;

of &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2024, when &#160;

compared to &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2023, &#160;

as these 

funds were &#160;

used in &#160;

part for &#160;

the purchase of &#160;

debt securities and &#160;

loan originations. Debt &#160;

securities available-for-sale increased &#160;

$1.8 

billion, mainly due to &#160;

purchases of U.S. Treasury &#160;

Securities. &#160;

Debt securities held-to-maturity decreased by &#160;

$218.8 million driven by 

maturities &#160;

of &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Treasury &#160;

securities, &#160;

partially &#160;

offset &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

accretion &#160;

of &#160;

$88.4 &#160;

million &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

discount &#160;

related &#160;

to &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Treasury 

securities previously reclassified from the &#160;

AFS to HTM. Refer &#160;

to Note 5 and &#160;

the Consolidated Financial Statements for 

additional information with respect to the Corporation&#8217;s debt &#160;

Loans 

Refer to Table &#160;

breakdown of the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

loan portfolio. Also, refer &#160;

to Note 7 in &#160;

the Consolidated Financial Statements 

for detailed information about the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio &#160;

composition and loan purchases and sales. &#160;

Loans held-in-portfolio &#160;

increased by &#160;

$526.6 million &#160;

to $35.6 &#160;

billion as &#160;

of June &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

compared to &#160;

loans held-in-portfolio &#160;

as of 

December 31, &#160;

2023. The &#160;

BPPR portfolio &#160;

increased by &#160;

$632.5 million, &#160;

driven by &#160;

the growth &#160;

in the &#160;

commercial, mortgage &#160;

and auto 

loans portfolio, &#160;

and the PB &#160;

loan portfolio decreased by &#160;

$105.8 million, due in &#160;

part by commercial &#160;

loans payoffs, offset &#160;

by growth in 

the construction loans portfolio. 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

$5.0 billion &#160;

non-owner occupied &#160;

commercial real &#160;

estate portfolio &#160;

is comprised &#160;

of $3.0 &#160;

billion in &#160;

BPPR and &#160;

$2.0 

billion in Popular U.S. and &#160;

is well diversified across a number &#160;

of tenants in different industries &#160;

and segments with exposure to retail 

(35% &#160;

of &#160;

non-owner &#160;

occupied &#160;

CRE), &#160;

hotels &#160;

(20%) &#160;

and &#160;

office &#160;

space &#160;

(13%) &#160;

accounting &#160;

for &#160;

two &#160;

thirds &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

total &#160;

exposure. &#160;

The 

approximate $624 million office space &#160;

exposure represents only 1.8% of &#160;

the total loan portfolio &#160;

and is comprised mainly of &#160;

mid-rise 

properties with diversified tenants with average loan &#160;

size of $2 million across both BPPR and Popular &#160;

U.S. 

Popular&#8217;s $2.4 billion commercial multi-family &#160;

portfolio represents approximately 7% of &#160;

total loans and is &#160;

concentrated in New York 

Metro ($1.4 billion), &#160;

South Florida ($739 million) and &#160;

Puerto Rico ($191 million). In &#160;

the New York &#160;

Metro region, the Corporation has 

no &#160;

exposure &#160;

to &#160;

rent &#160;

controlled &#160;

buildings. &#160;

The &#160;

majority &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

multi-family &#160;

loans &#160;

in &#160;

that &#160;

region &#160;

are &#160;

collateralized &#160;

by &#160;

underlying 

buildings that count on a mix &#160;

of units subject to rent stabilized (subject &#160;

to annual capped rent increases) and market-rate &#160;

units. The 

rent stabilized units represent less than 40% of the &#160;

total units in the loan portfolio with the &#160;

majority originated after 2019. The mix of 

units within &#160;

a building &#160;

is common &#160;

across the &#160;

New York &#160;

Metro region &#160;

due to &#160;

tax incentives &#160;

awarded to &#160;

developers based &#160;

on rent 

stabilized &#160;

units. &#160;

In &#160;

2024, &#160;

there &#160;

are &#160;

approximately $191 &#160;

million &#160;

in multi-family &#160;

loans &#160;

in &#160;

our &#160;

New &#160;

portfolio expected &#160;

to

The &#160;

increase in &#160;

June 30, 2024, compared to $63.6 billion as of December &#160;

31, 2023. An 

increase in the P.R. public sector, as well as increases in retail demand deposits and time deposits in PB, were the &#160;

main drivers of 

the $1.9 billion increase during the period. &#160;

P.R. &#160;

Public Sector Deposits 

As of June 30, 2024, the Puerto Rico public sector deposits amounted &#160;

to $19.7 billion, compared to $18.1 billion as of December &#160;

2023. 

Approximately &#160;

30% &#160;

deposits &#160;

as &#160;

of &#160;

June &#160;

2024 &#160;

are &#160;

funds &#160;

deposited &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Government &#160;

of &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico, 

municipalities and government &#160;

instrumentalities and corporations. P.R &#160;

public sector deposit &#160;

costs are indexed &#160;

to changes in &#160;

short-

term market &#160;

rates with &#160;

a one-quarter &#160;

lag, in &#160;

accordance with contractual &#160;

terms. As &#160;

a result, &#160;

these costs &#160;

may lag &#160;

in variable &#160;

asset 

repricing. These deposits require that the bank pledge high credit quality securities as collateral; therefore, liquidity &#160;

risks arising from 

deposit &#160;

outflows &#160;

are &#160;

lower. &#160;

Fluctuations &#160;

of &#160;

public &#160;

deposit &#160;

balances &#160;

are &#160;

uncertain &#160;

and &#160;

difficult &#160;

to &#160;

predict. &#160;

Factors &#160;

that &#160;

could &#160;

impact &#160;

these 

balances include, but are not limited to, the receipt of funds by the Puerto &#160;

Rico Government from federal disaster funding assistance 

(i.e. hurricane or pandemic related funds) and other &#160;

events such as seasonal tax collections which may result &#160;

in increases of public 

sector deposit balances at BPPR in the near term. The amount and timing of reductions in &#160;

deposit balances depend on government 

actions &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

the &#160;

speed &#160;

at &#160;

which &#160;

federal &#160;

REGULATORY CAPITAL 

The Corporation, BPPR and PB &#160;

are subject to regulatory capital &#160;

requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board. &#160;

The risk-

2024, &#160;

the 

Corporation had phased-in 75% of &#160;

I capital ratio, Tier I &#160;

capital ratio, and total capital ratio as &#160;

of June 30, 2024 as compared to 

December 31, 2023 was mainly due to &#160;

the six months period earnings. The increase in &#160;

leverage capital ratio was mainly due to &#160;

the

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Market / Interest Rate Risk 

The financial results and capital levels of the &#160;

Corporation are constantly exposed to market, interest &#160;

rate and liquidity risks. 

Market risk &#160;

refers to the &#160;

risk of a &#160;

reduction in the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s capital due &#160;

to changes in &#160;

the market valuation &#160;

of its assets &#160;

and/or 

liabilities. &#160;

Most of the assets &#160;

subject to market valuation risk &#160;

are debt securities classified as &#160;

available-for-sale. Refer to Notes 5 &#160;

and 6 to the 

Consolidated Financial &#160;

Statements for &#160;

further information &#160;

on the &#160;

debt &#160;

securities available-for-sale &#160;

and &#160;

held-to-maturity portfolios. 

Debt securities &#160;

classified as &#160;

available-for-sale amounted &#160;

to $18.5 &#160;

billion as &#160;

of June &#160;

30, 2024. &#160;

Other assets &#160;

subject to &#160;

market risk 

include loans held-for-sale, which amounted &#160;

to $8 million, mortgage &#160;

servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;) which &#160;

amounted to $113 &#160;

million, and 

securities classified as &#8220;trading&#8221;, which amounted to $28 &#160;

million, as of June 30, 2024. &#160;

Interest Rate Risk (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) 

The Corporation&#8217;s net interest income is subject &#160;

to various categories of interest rate risk, &#160;

including repricing, basis, yield curve and 

option risks. &#160;

In managing &#160;

interest rate &#160;

risk, management may &#160;

alter the &#160;

mix of &#160;

floating and &#160;

fixed rate &#160;

assets and &#160;

liabilities, change 

pricing &#160;

schedules, &#160;

adjust &#160;

maturities &#160;

through &#160;

sales &#160;

and &#160;

purchases &#160;

of &#160;

investment &#160;

securities, &#160;

and &#160;

enter &#160;

into &#160;

derivative &#160;

contracts, 

among other alternatives. &#160;

Interest &#160;

rate &#160;

risk &#160;

management &#160;

is &#160;

an &#160;

active &#160;

process &#160;

that &#160;

encompasses &#160;

monitoring &#160;

loan &#160;

and &#160;

deposit &#160;

flows &#160;

complemented &#160;

by 

investment and funding &#160;

activities. Effective management of &#160;

interest rate risk begins &#160;

with understanding the dynamic &#160;

characteristics 

of assets and &#160;

liabilities and determining the &#160;

appropriate rate risk position &#160;

given line of &#160;

business forecasts, management objectives, 

market expectations and policy constraints. 

Management utilizes various tools to assess IRR, including Net Interest &#160;

Income (&#8220;NII&#8221;) simulation modeling, static gap analysis, and 

Economic Value &#160;

of Equity &#160;

(&#8220;EVE&#8221;). The &#160;

three methodologies &#160;

complement each &#160;

other and &#160;

are used &#160;

jointly in &#160;

the evaluation &#160;

of the 

Corporation&#8217;s IRR. NII &#160;

simulation modeling is &#160;

prepared for a &#160;

five-year period, which &#160;

in conjunction with &#160;

the EVE analysis, &#160;

provides 

management a better view of long-term IRR. 

Net interest &#160;

income simulation analysis &#160;

performed by legal &#160;

entity and on &#160;

a consolidated basis &#160;

is a &#160;

tool used &#160;

by the &#160;

Corporation in 

estimating the &#160;

potential change &#160;

in net &#160;

interest income &#160;

resulting from &#160;

hypothetical changes &#160;

in interest &#160;

rates. Sensitivity &#160;

analysis is 

calculated using a simulation model which incorporates &#160;

actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity &#160;

and interest yields or costs. &#160;

Management assesses &#160;

interest rate &#160;

risk by &#160;

comparing various &#160;

NII simulations &#160;

under different &#160;

interest rate &#160;

scenarios that &#160;

differ in 

direction of interest &#160;

rate changes, the &#160;

degree of change &#160;

and the projected &#160;

shape of the &#160;

yield curve. For &#160;

example, the types &#160;

of rate 

scenarios processed during the &#160;

quarter include flat rates, &#160;

implied forwards, and parallel &#160;

and non-parallel rate shocks. &#160;

Management 

also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis &#160;

and prepayment risk exposures. &#160;

The asset &#160;

and liability &#160;

management group &#160;

performs validation &#160;

procedures on &#160;

various assumptions &#160;

used as &#160;

part of &#160;

the simulation 

analyses as well as validations &#160;

of results on a &#160;

monthly basis. In addition, the &#160;

model and processes used to &#160;

assess IRR are subject 

to independent validations according to the guidelines &#160;

established in the Model Governance and &#160;

Validation policy. 

The Corporation processes NII &#160;

simulations under interest rate &#160;

scenarios in which the &#160;

yield curve is assumed &#160;

to rise and &#160;

decline by 

the same magnitude &#160;

(parallel shifts). The &#160;

rate scenarios considered in &#160;

these market risk &#160;

simulations include instantaneous parallel 

changes of -100, -200, &#160;

+100, and +200 basis points &#160;

during the succeeding twelve-month period. Simulation analyses &#160;

are based on 

many assumptions, &#160;

including that &#160;

the balance &#160;

sheet remains &#160;

flat, the &#160;

relative levels &#160;

of market &#160;

interest rates &#160;

across all &#160;

yield curve 

points &#160;

and &#160;

indexes, &#160;

interest &#160;

rate &#160;

spreads, &#160;

loan &#160;

prepayments &#160;

and &#160;

deposit &#160;

elasticity. &#160;

Thus, &#160;

they &#160;

should &#160;

not &#160;

be &#160;

relied &#160;

upon &#160;

as 

indicative of actual results. Further, the estimates do not &#160;

contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in 

interest rates. Additionally, the Corporation is also subject to basis risk in the repricing of its assets and liabilities, including the basis 

related to &#160;

using different &#160;

rate indexes &#160;

for the &#160;

repricing of &#160;

assets and &#160;

liabilities, as &#160;

well as &#160;

the effect &#160;

of pricing &#160;

lags which &#160;

may be 

contractual &#160;

or &#160;

due to &#160;

historical differences &#160;

in the &#160;

timing &#160;

of &#160;

management responses &#160;

to &#160;

changes in &#160;

the rate &#160;

environment. By &#160;

their 

nature, these forward-looking computations are only estimates and may be different from &#160;

what may actually occur in the future. The 

following table &#160;

presents the &#160;

results of &#160;

the simulations &#160;

at June &#160;

As of June 30, 2024, NII simulations show the Corporation maintains an asset sensitive position that slightly increased as compared 

to &#160;

the &#160;

results &#160;

as &#160;

of &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2023. &#160;

The &#160;

primary &#160;

reasons &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

variation &#160;

in &#160;

sensitivity &#160;

are &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

balance &#160;

sheet 

composition driven by an increase in short-term U.S Treasury Bills (&#8220;T- &#160;

Bills&#8221;) partly offset by a reduction in overnight Fed Funds and 

U.S Treasury &#160;

Notes (&#8220;T- &#160;

Notes&#8221;) coupled &#160;

with a &#160;

larger loan &#160;

portfolio on &#160;

the asset &#160;

side, combined &#160;

with an &#160;

increase in &#160;

Puerto Rico 

public &#160;

sector &#160;

deposits &#160;

which &#160;

are &#160;

indexed &#160;

to &#160;

market &#160;

rates &#160;

and &#160;

higher &#160;

time &#160;

deposits. &#160;

These &#160;

results &#160;

suggest &#160;

that &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

the 

Corporation&#8217;s net &#160;

interest income sensitivity &#160;

are driven by &#160;

changes in the &#160;

composition of the &#160;

investment portfolio as &#160;

the term &#160;

bond 

portfolio &#160;

continues &#160;

to &#160;

run &#160;

off &#160;

and &#160;

get &#160;

reinvested, &#160;

together &#160;

with &#160;

excess &#160;

reserves, &#160;

in &#160;

short-term &#160;

investments &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

T-Bills. 

Additionally, variations in liability cost, primarily driven by Puerto Rico public sector deposits that represented $19.7 billion or 30% of 

deposits as &#160;

of June 30, &#160;

2024, as well &#160;

as changes in &#160;

the composition and &#160;

mix of &#160;

deposits, also impact &#160;

the sensitivity profile. &#160;

In the 

more extreme declining rate scenarios, &#160;

net interest income would be affected as the repricing of &#160;

short-term assets and variable rate 

loans slightly exceeds &#160;

the benefit in &#160;

cost reduction of &#160;

these deposits. In &#160;

rising rate scenarios, Popular&#8217;s &#160;

net interest income &#160;

is also 

impacted by its large proportion &#160;

of Puerto Rico public sector &#160;

deposit, however the repricing of assets &#160;

as they either reset &#160;

or mature 

lead to an increase in net interest income. 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

loan and &#160;

investment portfolios &#160;

are subject &#160;

to &#160;

prepayment risk, &#160;

which results &#160;

from the &#160;

ability of &#160;

a third-party &#160;

to 

repay debt &#160;

obligations prior &#160;

to maturity. &#160;

Prepayment risk &#160;

also could &#160;

have a &#160;

significant impact &#160;

on the &#160;

duration of &#160;

mortgage-backed 

securities &#160;

and &#160;

collateralized &#160;

mortgage &#160;

obligations &#160;

since &#160;

prepayments &#160;

could &#160;

shorten &#160;

(or &#160;

lower &#160;

prepayments &#160;

could &#160;

extend) &#160;

the 

weighted average life of these portfolios.

Trading &#160;

The Corporation &#160;

engages in &#160;

trading activities &#160;

in the &#160;

ordinary course &#160;

of business &#160;

at its &#160;

subsidiaries, BPPR &#160;

and Popular &#160;

Securities. 

Popular Securities&#8217; &#160;

trading activities &#160;

consist primarily &#160;

of market-making &#160;

activities to &#160;

meet expected &#160;

customers&#8217; needs &#160;

related to &#160;

its 

retail brokerage business, &#160;

and purchases and sales of U.S. Government and &#160;

government sponsored securities with the objective of 

realizing gains &#160;

from expected &#160;

short-term price &#160;

movements. BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

trading activities consist &#160;

primarily of &#160;

holding U.S. &#160;

Government 

sponsored &#160;

mortgage-backed securities &#160;

classified &#160;

as &#160;

&#8220;trading&#8221; and &#160;

hedging &#160;

the &#160;

related &#160;

market &#160;

risk &#160;

with &#160;

&#8220;TBA&#8221; &#160;

(to-be-announced) 

market &#160;

transactions. &#160;

The &#160;

objective &#160;

is &#160;

to &#160;

derive &#160;

spread &#160;

income &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

portfolio &#160;

and &#160;

not &#160;

to &#160;

benefit &#160;

from &#160;

short-term &#160;

market 

movements. In &#160;

addition, BPPR &#160;

uses forward &#160;

contracts or &#160;

TBAs to &#160;

hedge its &#160;

securitization pipeline. &#160;

Risks related &#160;

to variations &#160;

in 

interest rates &#160;

and market volatility &#160;

are hedged &#160;

with TBAs &#160;

that have &#160;

characteristics similar to &#160;

that of &#160;

the forecasted security &#160;

and its 

conversion timeline. 

At June &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

the Corporation held &#160;

trading securities &#160;

with a &#160;

fair value &#160;

of $28 &#160;

million, representing approximately &#160;

0.04% of the 

Corporation&#8217;s total &#160;

assets, compared &#160;

with $32 &#160;

million and &#160;

0.05%, respectively, &#160;

at December &#160;

31, 2023. &#160;

As shown &#160;

in Table &#160;

12, the 

trading portfolio &#160;

consists principally &#160;

of mortgage-backed &#160;

securities and &#160;

U.S. Treasuries, &#160;

which at &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2024 were &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s trading activities are &#160;

limited by internal policies. For each &#160;

of the two subsidiaries, the &#160;

market risk assumed under 

trading &#160;

activities &#160;

is &#160;

measured &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

5-day &#160;

net &#160;

value-at-risk &#160;

(&#8220;VAR&#8221;), &#160;

with &#160;

a &#160;

confidence &#160;

level &#160;

of &#160;

99%. &#160;

The &#160;

VAR &#160;

measures &#160;

the 

maximum estimated loss that may occur over a &#160;

5-day holding period, given a 99% probability. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s trading &#160;

portfolio &#160;

had &#160;

a &#160;

5-day VAR &#160;

of &#160;

approximately $0.4 &#160;

million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

last &#160;

week in &#160;

June &#160;

2024. VAR &#160;

models 

include &#160;

assumptions and &#160;

estimates thus &#160;

actual &#160;

results could &#160;

differ &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

outputs from &#160;

these &#160;

models &#160;

and &#160;

assumptions. Back-

testing is performed on model &#160;

results to compare actual results &#160;

against maximum estimated losses, in order &#160;

to evaluate model and 

assumptions accuracy. &#160;

In the opinion of management, the size and composition &#160;

of the trading portfolio does not represent &#160;

a significant source of market risk 

for the Corporation. 

Liquidity &#160;

The objective &#160;

of effective &#160;

liquidity management &#160;

is to &#160;

ensure that &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

has sufficient &#160;

liquidity to &#160;

meet all &#160;

of its &#160;

financial 

obligations, finance &#160;

expected future &#160;

growth, &#160;

fund &#160;

planned capital &#160;

distributions and &#160;

maintain a &#160;

reasonable safety &#160;

margin for &#160;

cash 

needs under &#160;

both normal &#160;

and stressed market &#160;

conditions. The Board &#160;

of Directors &#160;

is responsible &#160;

for establishing the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s 

tolerance for liquidity risk, &#160;

including approving relevant risk limits and &#160;

policies. The Board of &#160;

Directors has delegated the monitoring 

of &#160;

these risks &#160;

to &#160;

the Board&#8217;s &#160;

Risk Management &#160;

Committee and &#160;

the Asset/Liability &#160;

Management Committee. &#160;

other &#160;

reasons, including &#160;

exogenous events &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

the 

COVID-19 pandemic, &#160;

a downgrading &#160;

of its &#160;

credit rating, &#160;

or some &#160;

other event &#160;

that causes &#160;

counterparties to &#160;

avoid exposure &#160;

to the 

institution. Factors &#160;

that the &#160;

Corporation does &#160;

not control, &#160;

such &#160;

as the &#160;

economic outlook, &#160;

adverse ratings &#160;

of its &#160;

principal markets, 

perceptions of the financial services industry and regulatory &#160;

changes, could also affect its ability to obtain &#160;

funding. &#160;

The Corporation &#160;

has adopted &#160;

policies and &#160;

limits to &#160;

monitor the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s liquidity &#160;

position and &#160;

that of &#160;

its banking &#160;

subsidiaries. 

Additionally, contingency funding &#160;

plans are used to &#160;

model various stress events &#160;

of different magnitudes and &#160;

affecting different time 

horizons that assist &#160;

management in evaluating &#160;

the size of &#160;

the liquidity buffers &#160;

needed if those &#160;

stress events &#160;

occur. However, &#160;

such 

models &#160;

may &#160;

not &#160;

predict &#160;

accurately &#160;

Refer to Table 8 in this MD&#38;A section for a breakdown of deposits by major types. Core deposits are generated &#160;

from a large base of 

consumer, corporate and &#160;

public sector customers. Core deposits &#160;

include certificates of deposit &#160;

under $250,000, all interest-bearing 

transactional deposit accounts, &#160;

non-interest bearing deposits, &#160;

and savings deposits. &#160;

financed 87% of the Corporation&#8217;s earning assets at June &#160;

30, 2024, compared with 88% at December 31, &#160;

2023. 

In addition, the Corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the FHLB and at the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank of 

New York (the &#8220;FRB&#8221;) and has a considerable amount of collateral pledged &#160;

that can be used to raise funds under these &#160;

facilities. &#160;

During the &#160;

second quarter &#160;

of 2024 &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

had no &#160;

material incremental &#160;

use of &#160;

its available &#160;

liquidity sources. &#160;

At June &#160;

30, 

2024, the Corporation&#8217;s available liquidity increased to &#160;

$ 20.1 billion from $19.5 billion &#160;

on December 31, 2023. The liquidity sources

information &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

borrowing &#160;

facilities 

available through its banking subsidiaries. &#160;

The principal &#160;

uses of &#160;

funds for &#160;

the banking &#160;

subsidiaries include &#160;

loan originations, &#160;

investment portfolio &#160;

purchases, loan &#160;

purchases 

and repurchases, repayment of outstanding obligations (including deposits), advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational 

expenses. Also, the &#160;

banking subsidiaries assume liquidity &#160;

risk related to collateral &#160;

posting requirements for certain &#160;

activities mainly 

in &#160;

connection &#160;

with &#160;

contractual &#160;

commitments, &#160;

recourse &#160;

provisions, &#160;

servicing &#160;

&#160;

The banking &#160;

subsidiaries maintain &#160;

sufficient funding &#160;

capacity to &#160;

address large &#160;

increases in &#160;

funding requirements &#160;

such as &#160;

deposit 

outflows. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation has &#160;

established &#160;

liquidity &#160;

guidelines &#160;

that &#160;

require &#160;

the &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

to &#160;

have &#160;

sufficient &#160;

liquidity &#160;

to 

cover all short-term borrowings and a portion of deposits. &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s ability to compete &#160;

successfully in the marketplace for &#160;

deposits, excluding brokered deposits, depends on various 

factors, including pricing, service, convenience &#160;

and financial stability as &#160;

reflected by operating results and &#160;

financial condition, credit 

ratings (by &#160;

nationally recognized credit &#160;

rating agencies), customer &#160;

confidence, and &#160;

importantly, &#160;

FDIC deposit &#160;

insurance coverage. 

Deposits at all of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries are federally insured &#160;

(subject to FDIC limits) and this is expected to mitigate 

the potential effect of the aforementioned risks. 

The distribution by maturity &#160;

of certificates of deposit &#160;

with denominations of $250,000 and &#160;

over at June 30, &#160;

2024 is presented in &#160;

the 

table that follows:

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

had &#160;

$1.7 &#160;

billion &#160;

in &#160;

brokered &#160;

deposits &#160;

at &#160;

June &#160;

30, &#160;

2024, &#160;

which &#160;

financed &#160;

approximately &#160;

2% &#160;

of &#160;

its &#160;

total &#160;

assets 

(December 31, 2023 - &#160;

$1.7 billion and 2%, &#160;

respectively). &#160;

In the event that &#160;

any of the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

banking subsidiaries&#8217; regulatory 

capital &#160;

ratios fall &#160;

below those &#160;

required by &#160;

a &#160;

well-capitalized institution &#160;

or &#160;

are &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

capital &#160;

restrictions by &#160;

the &#160;

regulators, the 

Corporation would be &#160;

at risk that &#160;

such banking subsidiary &#160;

would not be &#160;

able to raise &#160;

or maintain brokered deposits &#160;

and could also 

face limitations &#160;

on the &#160;

rate paid &#160;

on deposits, &#160;

which may &#160;

hinder the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s ability &#160;

to effectively &#160;

compete in &#160;

its retail &#160;

markets 

and could affect its deposit raising efforts. &#160;

Deposits from the &#160;

public sector represent &#160;

an important source &#160;

of funds for &#160;

the Corporation. &#160;

As of June &#160;

30, 2024, total &#160;

Puerto Rico 

public sector &#160;

deposits were &#160;

$19.7 billion, &#160;

compared to &#160;

$18.1 billion &#160;

at December &#160;

31, 2023. &#160;

These deposits &#160;

require that &#160;

the bank 

pledges &#160;

high credit quality securities as collateral; therefore, liquidity risks arising from public &#160;

sector deposit outflows are lower given 

that the bank &#160;

receives its collateral &#160;

in return. This, &#160;

now unpledged, collateral &#160;

can either be &#160;

financed via repurchase &#160;

agreements or 

sold &#160;

for &#160;

cash. &#160;

However, &#160;

timing &#160;

differences &#160;

between &#160;

the &#160;

time &#160;

the &#160;

deposit &#160;

outflow &#160;

and &#160;

when &#160;

the &#160;

bank &#160;

receives &#160;

its &#160;

collateral &#160;

may 

occur. &#160;

Additionally, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

uses fixed-rate &#160;

U.S. Treasury &#160;

debt securities &#160;

as collateral &#160;

that have &#160;

limited credit &#160;

risk, but &#160;

are 

nonetheless subject to market value risk based on &#160;

changes in the interest rate environment. &#160;

When interest rates increase, the value 

of this &#160;

collateral decreases and &#160;

could result in &#160;

the Corporation having &#160;

to provide additional &#160;

collateral to cover &#160;

the same amount &#160;

of 

deposit &#160;

liabilities. &#160;

This &#160;

additional &#160;

collateral &#160;

could &#160;

reduce &#160;

unpledged &#160;

securities &#160;

otherwise &#160;

available &#160;

as &#160;

liquidity &#160;

sources &#160;

to &#160;

the 

Corporation. &#160;

As of &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2024, management &#160;

believes that &#160;

the banking &#160;

subsidiaries had &#160;

sufficient current &#160;

and projected &#160;

liquidity sources &#160;

to 

meet their anticipated cash flow obligations, &#160;

as well as special needs &#160;

and off-balance sheet commitments, in the &#160;

ordinary course of 

business. &#160;

Management also believes that as of June 30, &#160;

2024 its banking subsidiaries have sufficient liquidity current and projected 

resources to address a stress event. Although the banking subsidiaries have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and 

advances, &#160;

no assurance &#160;

can &#160;

be given &#160;

that &#160;

they &#160;

would be &#160;

able to &#160;

replace &#160;

those funds &#160;

in &#160;

the future &#160;

if &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s financial 

condition or &#160;

general market &#160;

conditions were &#160;

to deteriorate. &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

financial flexibility &#160;

will be &#160;

severely constrained &#160;

if the 

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

are &#160;

unable &#160;

to &#160;

maintain &#160;

access &#160;

to &#160;

funding &#160;

or &#160;

if &#160;

adequate &#160;

financing &#160;

is &#160;

not &#160;

available &#160;

to &#160;

accommodate &#160;

future 

financing &#160;

needs &#160;

at &#160;

acceptable &#160;

interest &#160;

rates. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

have &#160;

to &#160;

meet &#160;

margin &#160;

requirements &#160;

on 

repurchase &#160;

agreements &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

collateralized &#160;

borrowing &#160;

facilities &#160;

that &#160;

include &#160;

certain &#160;

required &#160;

levels &#160;

of &#160;

cash &#160;

deposits &#160;

and 

qualifying &#160;

securities. &#160;

To &#160;

the &#160;

extent &#160;

that &#160;

the &#160;

value &#160;

of &#160;

securities &#160;

previously &#160;

pledged &#160;

as &#160;

collateral &#160;

declines &#160;

below &#160;

such &#160;

required 

amounts &#160;

because &#160;

of &#160;

market &#160;

changes, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

is &#160;

required &#160;

to &#160;

deposit &#160;

additional &#160;

cash &#160;

or &#160;

securities &#160;

to &#160;

meet &#160;

its &#160;

margin 

requirements, thereby adversely &#160;

affecting its &#160;

liquidity. &#160;

Finally, &#160;

to the &#160;

extent the &#160;

Corporation relies more &#160;

heavily on &#160;

more expensive 

funding sources in order to meet its future growth, revenues &#160;

may not increase in a manner that is proportionate to cover these &#160;

costs. 

In this case, the Corporation&#8217;s profitability would be adversely &#160;

effected.

2023. 

Additionally, the Corporation&#8217;s latest quarterly dividend was $0.62 per share or approximately &#160;

$45 million per quarter. 

The BHCs have in &#160;

the past borrowed in the &#160;

corporate debt market primarily to finance &#160;

their non-banking subsidiaries and refinance 

debt obligations. The issuance of corporate debt as &#160;

a source of funding is likely more &#160;

costly due to the fact that &#160;

two out of the three 

principal credit &#160;

rating agencies &#160;

rate the &#160;

Corporation below &#160;

&#8220;investment grade&#8221;, &#160;

which affects &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

cost &#160;

and ability &#160;

to 

raise &#160;

funds &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

capital &#160;

markets. &#160;

Factors &#160;

that &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

does &#160;

not &#160;

control, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

the &#160;

economic &#160;

outlook, &#160;

interest &#160;

rate 

volatility, &#160;

inflation, disruptions in &#160;

the debt market, &#160;

among others, could &#160;

also affect &#160;

its ability to &#160;

obtain funding. The &#160;

Corporation has 

an &#160;

automatic &#160;

shelf &#160;

registration &#160;

statement &#160;

filed &#160;

and &#160;

effective &#160;

the &#160;

Securities &#160;

Exchange &#160;

Commission, &#160;

which &#160;

permits &#160;

the 

Corporation to issue an unspecified amount of debt &#160;

or equity securities. 

Non-Banking Subsidiaries 

The &#160;

principal &#160;

sources &#160;

of &#160;

funding &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

non-banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

include &#160;

internally &#160;

generated &#160;

cash &#160;

flows &#160;

from &#160;

operations, &#160;

loan 

sales, repurchase agreements, capital &#160;

injections and borrowed funds &#160;

from their direct &#160;

parent companies or the &#160;

holding companies. 

The principal uses of funds for the non-banking &#160;

subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt, &#160;

operational expenses and payment 

of dividends to the &#160;

BHCs. The liquidity needs &#160;

of the non-banking subsidiaries &#160;

are minimal since most &#160;

of them are &#160;

funded internally 

from &#160;

operating cash &#160;

flows &#160;

or from &#160;

intercompany borrowings &#160;

or capital &#160;

contributions from &#160;

their holding &#160;

companies. During &#160;

$1.24 &#160;

per &#160;

common &#160;

outstanding 

($89.7 million in the &#160;

aggregate). The dividends for the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s Series A preferred stock &#160;

amounted to $0.7 million. On &#160;

July 24, 

2024, the corporation announced an &#160;

increase in the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

quarterly common stock dividend from &#160;

$0.62 to $0.70 per &#160;

share, 

commencing with the dividend payable in the first &#160;

quarter of 2025, subject to the approval by &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors. 

During the six &#160;

months ended June 30, &#160;

2024, the BHCs &#160;

at June &#160;

the debt &#160;

securities portfolio &#160;

provides an 

additional &#160;

source &#160;

of &#160;

liquidity, &#160;

which &#160;

may &#160;

be &#160;

realized &#160;

through &#160;

either &#160;

securities &#160;

sales, &#160;

collateralized &#160;

borrowings &#160;

or &#160;

repurchase 

agreements. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

debt &#160;

securities &#160;

portfolio &#160;

consists &#160;

primarily &#160;

of &#160;

liquid &#160;

U.S. &#160;

government &#160;

debt &#160;

securities, &#160;

U.S.

and &#160;

U.S. 

government &#160;

sponsored &#160;

agency &#160;

collateralized &#160;

mortgage &#160;

obligations &#160;

that &#160;

can &#160;

be &#160;

used &#160;

to &#160;

raise &#160;

funds &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

repo &#160;

markets. &#160;

The 

availability &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

repurchase &#160;

agreement &#160;

would &#160;

be &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

having &#160;

sufficient &#160;

unpledged &#160;

collateral &#160;

available &#160;

at &#160;

the &#160;

time &#160;

the 

transactions are consummated, in addition to overall liquidity and risk appetite of the various counterparties. In 2023, BPPR became 

an &#160;

approved counterparty &#160;

in the &#160;

Federal Reserve&#8217;s &#160;

Standing Repo &#160;

Facility. &#160;

This &#160;

allows approved &#160;

counterparties to &#160;

participate in 

daily auctions &#160;

with the &#160;

Standing Repo &#160;

Facility for &#160;

up to &#160;

$500 billion &#160;

in aggregate &#160;

of overnight financing &#160;

using U.S. &#160;

Treasuries and 

Agency MBS as &#160;

collateral. The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

unpledged debt securities &#160;

amounted to $ &#160;

4.6 billion at &#160;

June 30, 2024 &#160;

and December 

31, 2023. A substantial portion of &#160;

these debt securities could be used to &#160;

raise financing in the U.S. money &#160;

markets or from secured 

lending sources, &#160;

subject to changes in their fair market value and customary adjustments &#160;

(haircuts). &#160;

Additional liquidity may &#160;

be provided through &#160;

loan maturities, prepayments &#160;

and sales. The &#160;

loan portfolio can &#160;

also be used &#160;

to obtain 

funding in the capital markets. In particular, &#160;

mortgage loans and some types of consumer loans, have &#160;

secondary markets which the 

Corporation could use. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments 

In the ordinary course &#160;

of business, the Corporation &#160;

engages in financial transactions &#160;

that are not recorded &#160;

on the balance sheet &#160;

or 

may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different than the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. As a 

provider of &#160;

financial services, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

routinely enters &#160;

into commitments &#160;

with off-balance &#160;

sheet risk &#160;

to meet &#160;

the financial 

needs of &#160;

its customers. These &#160;

commitments may include &#160;

loan commitments and &#160;

standby letters of &#160;

credit. These commitments &#160;

are 

subject &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

same &#160;

credit &#160;

policies &#160;

and &#160;

approval &#160;

process &#160;

used &#160;

for &#160;

on-balance &#160;

sheet &#160;

instruments. &#160;

These &#160;

instruments &#160;

involve, &#160;

to 

varying degrees, elements &#160;

of credit and &#160;

interest rate risk &#160;

in excess of &#160;

the amount recognized &#160;

in the statement &#160;

of financial position.

and 

other non-credit commitments. &#160;

Other types &#160;

of off-balance &#160;

sheet arrangements &#160;

that the &#160;

Corporation enters &#160;

in the &#160;

ordinary course &#160;

of business &#160;

include derivatives, 

operating &#160;

leases &#160;

and &#160;

provision &#160;

of &#160;

FDIC Special Assessments &#160;

On &#160;

November &#160;

2023, &#160;

the &#160;

Federal &#160;

Deposit &#160;

Insurance &#160;

Corporation &#160;

(&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) &#160;

approved &#160;

a &#160;

final &#160;

rule &#160;

that &#160;

imposes &#160;

a &#160;

special 

assessment (the &#8220;FDIC &#160;

Special Assessment&#8221;) to recover &#160;

the losses to &#160;

the deposit insurance &#160;

fund resulting from &#160;

the FDIC&#8217;s use, &#160;

in 

March &#160;

2023, &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

systemic &#160;

risk &#160;

exception. In &#160;

connection with &#160;

this assessment, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation recorded &#160;

an &#160;

expense of &#160;

$71.4 

million, $45.3 million net of tax, &#160;

in the fourth quarter of 2023, &#160;

representing the full amount of the &#160;

estimated assessment at that time. 

The &#160;

special &#160;

assessment &#160;

amount &#160;

and &#160;

collection &#160;

period &#160;

may &#160;

change &#160;

as &#160;

the &#160;

estimated &#160;

loss &#160;

is &#160;

periodically &#160;

adjusted &#160;

or &#160;

if &#160;

the &#160;

total 

amount collected varies. As &#160;

a result, the Corporation &#160;

recorded an additional expense &#160;

of $14.3 million, $9.1 &#160;

million net of tax, &#160;

in the 

first quarter of 2024, based on the updated &#160;

loss estimates.

In addition to the dividend income reflected in &#160;

the Statement of Operations table above, during &#160;

the six months ended June 

30, 2024, the obligor group recorded a $67.4 &#160;

million of capital distributions from non-obligor &#160;

subsidiaries which were in an 

accumulated loss position and accordingly were &#160;

recorded as a reduction to the investments. 

Risks to Liquidity &#160;

Total lines of credit outstanding, or available borrowing capacity under lines of credit are not necessarily &#160;

a measure of the total credit 

available &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

continuing &#160;

basis. &#160;

These &#160;

lines &#160;

may &#160;

be &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

collateral &#160;

requirements, &#160;

changes &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

value &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

collateral, 

standards of &#160;

creditworthiness, leverage ratios &#160;

and other &#160;

regulatory requirements, among &#160;

other factors. &#160;

Derivatives, such &#160;

as those 

embedded &#160;

in &#160;

long-term &#160;

repurchase &#160;

transactions &#160;

or &#160;

interest &#160;

rate &#160;

swaps, &#160;

and &#160;

off-balance &#160;

sheet &#160;

exposures, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

recourse, 

&#160;

performance bonds or &#160;

credit card &#160;

arrangements, are subject &#160;

to collateral requirements. &#160;

As their &#160;

fair value &#160;

increases, the collateral 

requirements may increase, thereby reducing the &#160;

balance of unpledged securities. 

The importance of &#160;

the Puerto Rico &#160;

market for the &#160;

Corporation is an &#160;

additional risk factor &#160;

that could affect &#160;

its financing activities. &#160;

In 

the case &#160;

of a &#160;

deterioration in &#160;

the outlook &#160;

and/or credit &#160;

ratings of &#160;

its principal &#160;

markets and/or &#160;

due to &#160;

regulatory changes &#160;

and fiscal 

conditions in &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

that are &#160;

outside the &#160;

control of &#160;

the Corporation, &#160;

the credit &#160;

quality of &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

could be &#160;

adversely 

affected and result in higher credit costs. These adverse events &#160;

could also affect the Corporation&#8217;s ability to obtain funding. 

To &#160;

plan for the possibility of &#160;

such a scenario, management adopted contingency &#160;

plans to address events that could &#160;

limit or partially 

limit important &#160;

sources of &#160;

funds that &#160;

are usually &#160;

fully available &#160;

for use. &#160;

These plans &#160;

call for &#160;

using alternate &#160;

funding mechanisms, 

such as the &#160;

pledging of certain &#160;

asset classes and accessing &#160;

secured credit lines &#160;

and loan facilities &#160;

put in place &#160;

with the FHLB &#160;

and 

the &#160;

FRB. &#160;

The Corporation &#160;

is subject &#160;

to &#160;

positive tangible &#160;

capital &#160;

requirements to &#160;

utilize secured &#160;

loan facilities &#160;

with the &#160;

FHLB that 

could &#160;

result &#160;

in &#160;

a &#160;

limitation &#160;

of &#160;

borrowing &#160;

amounts &#160;

or &#160;

maturity &#160;

terms, &#160;

even &#160;

if &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

exceeds &#160;

well-capitalized &#160;

regulatory 

capital levels. &#160;

The credit &#160;

ratings of &#160;

Popular&#8217;s debt &#160;

obligations are &#160;

a relevant &#160;

factor for &#160;

liquidity because &#160;

they impact &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

ability to 

borrow &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

capital &#160;

markets, &#160;

its &#160;

cost &#160;

and &#160;

access &#160;

to &#160;

funding &#160;

sources. &#160;

Credit &#160;

ratings &#160;

are &#160;

based &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

financial &#160;

strength, &#160;

credit 

quality and &#160;

concentrations in &#160;

the loan &#160;

portfolio, the &#160;

level and &#160;

volatility of &#160;

earnings, capital &#160;

adequacy, &#160;

the quality &#160;

of management, 

geographic concentration &#160;

in Puerto &#160;

Rico, the &#160;

liquidity of &#160;

the balance &#160;

sheet, the &#160;

availability of &#160;

a significant &#160;

base of &#160;

core retail &#160;

and 

commercial deposits, and the Corporation&#8217;s ability to access &#160;

a broad array of wholesale funding sources, &#160;

among other factors. &#160;

Furthermore, &#160;

various &#160;

statutory &#160;

provisions &#160;

limit &#160;

the &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

dividends &#160;

an &#160;

insured &#160;

depository &#160;

institution &#160;

may &#160;

pay &#160;

to &#160;

its &#160;

holding 

company without &#160;

regulatory approval. A &#160;

member bank must &#160;

obtain the &#160;

approval of &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve Board &#160;

for any &#160;

dividend, if 

the total of all dividends declared by the member &#160;

bank during the calendar year would exceed &#160;

the combined net income for that year 

and the retained net income for &#160;

the preceding two years, net of &#160;

those years&#8217; dividend activity, &#160;

less any required transfers to surplus 

or to a &#160;

fund for the &#160;

retirement of any &#160;

preferred stock. In &#160;

addition, a member &#160;

bank may not &#160;

declare or pay &#160;

a dividend in &#160;

an amount 

greater &#160;

than &#160;

its &#160;

undivided &#160;

profits &#160;

as &#160;

reported &#160;

in &#160;

its &#160;

Report &#160;

of &#160;

Condition and &#160;

Income, &#160;

unless &#160;

the &#160;

member &#160;

bank &#160;

has &#160;

received &#160;

the 

approval of &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve Board. A &#160;

member bank also &#160;

may not permit &#160;

any portion of &#160;

its permanent capital &#160;

to be &#160;

withdrawn 

unless the withdrawal has been approved by &#160;

the Federal Reserve Board. The ability of &#160;

a bank subsidiary to up-stream dividends to 

its BHC &#160;

could thus &#160;

be impacted &#160;

by its &#160;

financial performance &#160;

and capital, &#160;

including tangible &#160;

and regulatory &#160;

capital, thus &#160;

potentially 

limiting the &#160;

amount of &#160;

cash moving &#160;

up to &#160;

the BHCs &#160;

from &#160;

the banking &#160;

subsidiaries. This &#160;

could, &#160;

in turn, &#160;

affect &#160;

the BHCs &#160;

ability to 

declare &#160;

dividends &#160;

on &#160;

its &#160;

outstanding &#160;

common &#160;

and &#160;

preferred &#160;

stock, &#160;

repurchase &#160;

its &#160;

securities &#160;

or &#160;

meet &#160;

its &#160;

debt &#160;

obligations, &#160;

for 

example. 

During the six &#160;

months ended June &#160;

30, 2024, BPPR &#160;

declared cash dividends &#160;

of $300 &#160;

million to PIHC. &#160;

As of &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2024, BPPR 

can declare a dividend of approximately $409 million &#160;

without prior approval of the Federal Reserve &#160;

Board due to its retained income, 

declared &#160;

dividend &#160;

activity &#160;

and &#160;

transfers &#160;

to &#160;

statutory &#160;

reserves &#160;

over the &#160;

measurement &#160;

period. &#160;

Pursuant &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

requirements &#160;

listed 

above, PB &#160;

may &#160;

not declare &#160;

or &#160;

pay &#160;

a dividend &#160;

without the &#160;

prior approval &#160;

of the &#160;

Federal Reserve &#160;

Board and &#160;

the &#160;

New York &#160;

State 

Department of Financial Services. 

The Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries have historically not &#160;

used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance &#160;

its operations, and 

therefore are less sensitive to the level and &#160;

changes in the Corporation&#8217;s overall credit ratings. 

Refer to the &#160;

Geographic and Government Risk section &#160;

of this MD&#38;A for &#160;

some highlights on the &#160;

status of the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy 

and the ongoing fiscal crisis. 

Obligations Subject to Rating Triggers or Collateral Requirements 

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

currently &#160;

do &#160;

not &#160;

issue &#160;

unsecured &#160;

senior &#160;

debt, &#160;

as &#160;

these &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

are &#160;

funded 

primarily with &#160;

deposits and &#160;

secured borrowings. &#160;

The banking &#160;

subsidiaries had &#160;

$7.8 million &#160;

in deposits &#160;

at June &#160;

30, 2024 &#160;

that are 

subject to rating triggers. &#160;

In addition, &#160;

certain mortgage servicing &#160;

and custodial agreements &#160;

that BPPR &#160;

has with &#160;

third parties &#160;

include rating covenants. &#160;

In the 

event of a credit rating downgrade, the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for 

escrow deposits and/or increase collateral levels &#160;

securing the recourse obligations. &#160;

As discussed &#160;

in Note &#160;

19 to &#160;

the Consolidated Financial &#160;

Statements, the Corporation &#160;

services residential mortgage &#160;

loans subject &#160;

to 

credit &#160;

recourse &#160;

provisions. &#160;

Certain &#160;

contractual &#160;

agreements &#160;

require &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

to &#160;

post &#160;

collateral &#160;

to &#160;

secure &#160;

such &#160;

recourse 

obligations if &#160;

the institution&#8217;s &#160;

required credit &#160;

ratings are &#160;

not maintained. &#160;

Collateral pledged &#160;

by the &#160;

Corporation to &#160;

secure recourse 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

obligations &#160;

amounted &#160;

to &#160;

approximately &#160;

$26.4 &#160;

million &#160;

at &#160;

June &#160;

30, &#160;

2024. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

could &#160;

be &#160;

required &#160;

to &#160;

post &#160;

additional 

collateral under the &#160;

agreements. Management expects that &#160;

it would be &#160;

able to meet &#160;

additional collateral requirements if &#160;

and when 

needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the Corporation&#8217;s 

liquidity resources and impact its operating results.

Credit Risk 

Geographic and Government Risk &#160;

The Corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk. &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s assets and revenue composition by geographical 

area and by business segment reporting are presented &#160;

in Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 

A &#160;

significant portion &#160;

of &#160;

our financial &#160;

activities and &#160;

credit &#160;

exposure is &#160;

concentrated in &#160;

the &#160;

Commonwealth of &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

(&#8220;Puerto 

Rico&#8221;), which has faced severe economic and fiscal &#160;

challenges in the past and may face additional &#160;

challenges in the future. &#160;

Economic Performance. &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico&#8217;s &#160;

economy suffered &#160;

a &#160;

severe and &#160;

prolonged recession &#160;

from &#160;

2007 &#160;

to &#160;

2017, &#160;

with real &#160;

gross national &#160;

product (&#8220;GNP&#8221;) 

contracting approximately 15% &#160;

during this period. &#160;

In 2017, Hurricane &#160;

Mar&#237;a caused significant &#160;

damage and destruction &#160;

across the 

island, resulting in further economic contraction. Puerto Rico&#8217;s &#160;

economy has been gradually recovering since 2018, in &#160;

part aided by 

the large amount &#160;

of federal disaster &#160;

relief and recovery &#160;

assistance funds injected &#160;

into the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy in &#160;

connection with 

Hurricane Mar&#237;a &#160;

and other &#160;

recent natural &#160;

disasters. This &#160;

growth was &#160;

interrupted by &#160;

the economic &#160;

shock caused &#160;

by the &#160;

COVID-19 

pandemic in 2020, but has since resumed, in part &#160;

aided by additional federal assistance from &#160;

pandemic-related stimulus measures. 

The &#160;

latest &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

Economic Activity &#160;

Index, &#160;

published &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Economic &#160;

Development Bank &#160;

for &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

(the &#160;

&#8220;Economic 

Activity Index&#8221;), reflected a 2.0% year-over-year decline and a &#160;

0.6% month-over-month decline in April 2024. The Economic Activity 

Index is &#160;

a coincident &#160;

indicator of &#160;

ongoing economic &#160;

activity but &#160;

not a &#160;

direct measurement &#160;

of real &#160;

GNP. &#160;

The Puerto &#160;

Rico Planning 

Board estimates that Puerto Rico&#8217;s real GNP grew 2.8% &#160;

during fiscal year 2024 (July 2023-June 2024) and projects 1.4% real GNP 

growth for fiscal year 2025 (July 2024-June 2025). 

While the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

economy has &#160;

not directly &#160;

tracked the &#160;

United States &#160;

economy in &#160;

recent years, &#160;

many of &#160;

the external &#160;

factors 

that impact &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy &#160;

are affected &#160;

by the &#160;

policies and performance &#160;

of the &#160;

United States &#160;

economy. &#160;

These external 

factors include &#160;

the level &#160;

of interest &#160;

rates and &#160;

the rate &#160;

of inflation. &#160;

Inflation in &#160;

the United &#160;

States, as &#160;

measured by the &#160;

United States 

Consumer Price Index &#160;

(published by the &#160;

U.S. Bureau of &#160;

Labor Statistics), increased &#160;

3.0% during the &#160;

12-month period ended &#160;

June 

2024. &#160;

Inflation in Puerto Rico, &#160;

as measured by the &#160;

Puerto Rico Consumer Price &#160;

Index (published by the &#160;

Department of Labor and 

Human Resources &#160;

of Puerto &#160;

Rico), increased &#160;

2.5% &#160;

during the &#160;

12-month period &#160;

ended April &#160;

2024. The &#160;

rate of &#160;

inflation gradually 

decreased from a mid-2022 peak, as the Federal Reserve &#160;

implemented a series of benchmark interest &#160;

rate increases. &#160;

Fiscal Challenges. &#160;

As the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

economy contracted, the &#160;

government&#8217;s public &#160;

debt rose &#160;

rapidly, &#160;

in part &#160;

from borrowing to &#160;

cover deficits &#160;

to pay 

debt service, &#160;

pension benefits and &#160;

other government expenditures. &#160;

By 2016, &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico government had &#160;

over $120 &#160;

billion in 

combined debt and unfunded pension liabilities, had &#160;

lost access to the capital markets, and was in &#160;

the midst of a fiscal crisis. 

Puerto &#160;

Rico&#8217;s &#160;

escalating fiscal &#160;

and economic &#160;

challenges &#160;

and imminent &#160;

widespread defaults &#160;

in &#160;

its &#160;

public debt &#160;

prompted the &#160;

U.S. 

Congress to &#160;

enact the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

Oversight, Management, &#160;

and Economic &#160;

Stability Act &#160;

(&#8220;PROMESA&#8221;) in &#160;

June 2016. &#160;

PROMESA 

created the &#8220;Oversight Board&#8221; with ample powers over Puerto Rico&#8217;s fiscal and economic affairs and those of its public corporations, 

instrumentalities and municipalities (collectively, &#160;

&#8220;PR Government Entities&#8221;). Pursuant &#160;

to PROMESA, the &#160;

Oversight Board will be &#160;

in 

place &#160;

until &#160;

market &#160;

access &#160;

is &#160;

restored &#160;

and &#160;

balanced &#160;

budgets &#160;

are &#160;

produced &#160;

for &#160;

at &#160;

least &#160;

four &#160;

consecutive &#160;

years. &#160;

PROMESA &#160;

also 

established two &#160;

mechanisms for &#160;

the restructuring &#160;

of the &#160;

obligations of &#160;

PR Government &#160;

Entities: (a) &#160;

Title III, &#160;

which provides &#160;

an in-

court process that incorporates many of the &#160;

powers and provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code &#160;

and permits adjustment of a broad 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

range of obligations, and &#160;

(b) Title VI, &#160;

which provides for a &#160;

largely out-of-court process through which &#160;

modifications to financial debt 

can be accepted by a supermajority of creditors &#160;

and bind holdouts. 

Since 2017, Puerto Rico and several &#160;

of its instrumentalities have availed themselves &#160;

of the debt restructuring mechanisms of Titles 

III and VI of PROMESA. The Puerto Rico government emerged from Title III of PROMESA in March 2022. Several instrumentalities, 

including &#160;

Government &#160;

Development &#160;

Bank &#160;

for &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico, &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

Sales &#160;

Tax &#160;

Financing &#160;

Corporation, &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico 

Highways &#160;

and &#160;

Transportation &#160;

Authority, &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

Industrial &#160;

Development &#160;

Company, &#160;

have &#160;

also &#160;

completed &#160;

debt 

restructurings &#160;

under &#160;

Titles &#160;

III &#160;

or &#160;

VI &#160;

of &#160;

PROMESA. &#160;

While &#160;

the &#160;

majority &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

debt &#160;

has &#160;

already &#160;

been &#160;

restructured, &#160;

some &#160;

PR 

Government &#160;

Entities &#160;

still &#160;

face &#160;

significant &#160;

fiscal &#160;

challenges. &#160;

For &#160;

example, &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

Electric &#160;

Power &#160;

Authority &#160;

is &#160;

still &#160;

in &#160;

the 

process of restructuring its debts under Title III of PROMESA. 

Municipalities. &#160;

Puerto Rico&#8217;s &#160;

fiscal and &#160;

economic challenges &#160;

have also &#160;

adversely impacted its &#160;

municipalities. Historically, &#160;

the central &#160;

government 

provided &#160;

significant &#160;

annual &#160;

subsidies &#160;

to &#160;

municipalities &#160;

based &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

statutory &#160;

formula. &#160;

However, &#160;

as &#160;

part &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

fiscal &#160;

measures 

required &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board, &#160;

municipal &#160;

subsidies &#160;

have &#160;

decreased &#160;

significantly &#160;

over &#160;

several &#160;

years &#160;

and &#160;

are &#160;

now &#160;

approved 

through specific, non-recurring &#160;

appropriations. This decrease &#160;

has been partially &#160;

offset by &#160;

substantial non-recurring federal &#160;

disaster 

and &#160;

COVID-relief funding &#160;

received by &#160;

municipalities in &#160;

recent years. &#160;

The latest &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

fiscal plan &#160;

certified by &#160;

the Oversight 

Board provides for &#160;

the implementation of &#160;

a restructured grant &#160;

and transfer system &#160;

through which the &#160;

Commonwealth would award 

specific &#160;

service &#160;

grants to &#160;

municipalities to &#160;

augment &#160;

existing municipal &#160;

service &#160;

delivery, &#160;

while also &#160;

incentivizing performance &#160;

and 

enhanced accountability through the monitoring of outcome &#160;

metrics. &#160;

Municipalities are subject to PROMESA, and the Oversight Board &#160;

has the authority to require them to submit fiscal plans and annual 

budgets for &#160;

review and &#160;

approval. The &#160;

Oversight Board &#160;

has imposed &#160;

this requirement &#160;

for certain &#160;

municipalities. Municipalities &#160;

are 

also &#160;

required &#160;

to &#160;

seek &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board &#160;

approval &#160;

to &#160;

issue, &#160;

guarantee &#160;

or &#160;

modify &#160;

their &#160;

debts &#160;

and &#160;

to &#160;

enter &#160;

into &#160;

contracts &#160;

with &#160;

an 

aggregate value of &#160;

$10 million or &#160;

more. With the &#160;

Oversight Board&#8217;s approval, &#160;

municipalities are also &#160;

eligible to avail &#160;

themselves of 

the &#160;

debt &#160;

restructuring processes &#160;

provided &#160;

by &#160;

PROMESA. To &#160;

date, &#160;

however, &#160;

no municipality &#160;

has &#160;

been &#160;

subject to &#160;

any &#160;

such &#160;

debt 

restructuring process. 

Exposure of the Corporation &#160;

The credit &#160;

quality of BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

loan portfolio &#160;

reflects, among other &#160;

things, the &#160;

general economic conditions &#160;

in Puerto &#160;

Rico and &#160;

other 

adverse conditions affecting Puerto &#160;

Rico consumers and businesses. &#160;

Deterioration in the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy has resulted &#160;

in the 

past, and could &#160;

result in the future, &#160;

in higher delinquencies, greater &#160;

charge-offs and increased losses, &#160;

which could materially affect 

our financial condition and results of operations. &#160;

At June &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

direct exposure &#160;

to &#160;

PR &#160;

Government Entities &#160;

totaled $376 &#160;

million, of &#160;

which $376 &#160;

million were 

outstanding, compared &#160;

to &#160;

$362 million &#160;

at &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2023, of &#160;

which $333 &#160;

million &#160;

were outstanding. &#160;

A &#160;

deterioration in &#160;

Puerto 

Rico&#8217;s fiscal and &#160;

economic situation could adversely &#160;

affect the value &#160;

of our Puerto &#160;

Rico government obligations, resulting &#160;

in losses 

to &#160;

us. &#160;

Of &#160;

the &#160;

amount &#160;

outstanding, &#160;

$360 &#160;

million &#160;

consists &#160;

of &#160;

loans &#160;

and &#160;

$16 &#160;

million &#160;

are &#160;

securities &#160;

($314 &#160;

million &#160;

and &#160;

$19 &#160;

million, 

respectively, &#160;

at &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2023). &#160;

Substantially &#160;

all &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

direct &#160;

exposure &#160;

outstanding &#160;

at &#160;

June &#160;

30, &#160;

2024 &#160;

were 

obligations from various &#160;

Puerto Rico municipalities. &#160;

In most &#160;

cases, these were &#160;

&#8220;general obligations&#8221; of &#160;

a municipality, &#160;

to which &#160;

the 

applicable municipality &#160;

has &#160;

pledged its &#160;

good faith, &#160;

credit &#160;

and unlimited &#160;

taxing &#160;

power, &#160;

or &#8220;special &#160;

obligations&#8221; of &#160;

a municipality, &#160;

to 

which the applicable municipality has pledged basic property tax or sales tax &#160;

revenues.

At June 30, 2024, 79% of the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s 

exposure to municipal loans and securities was concentrated in the municipalities of San Juan, &#160;

Guaynabo, Carolina and Caguas. &#160;

In 

July 2024, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

received scheduled &#160;

principal payments &#160;

amounting to &#160;

$40 million &#160;

from various &#160;

obligations from &#160;

Puerto 

Rico &#160;

municipalities. &#160;

For &#160;

additional &#160;

discussion &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

direct &#160;

exposure &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

government &#160;

and &#160;

its 

instrumentalities and municipalities, refer to Note &#160;

20 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the &#160;

Consolidated Financial Statements. &#160;

In addition, &#160;

at June &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

the Corporation had &#160;

$229 million &#160;

in loans &#160;

insured or &#160;

securities issued by &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

governmental 

entities, but for &#160;

which the principal source &#160;

of repayment is &#160;

non-governmental ($238 million at December 31, 2023). &#160;

These included 

$183 million in &#160;

residential mortgage loans insured &#160;

by the Puerto &#160;

Rico Housing Finance Authority &#160;

(&#8220;HFA&#8221;), a &#160;

PR Government Entity 

(December 31, 2023 - $191 million). These mortgage loans are secured &#160;

by first mortgages on Puerto Rico residential properties and 

the &#160;

HFA &#160;

insurance &#160;

covers &#160;

losses &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

event &#160;

of &#160;

a &#160;

borrower &#160;

default &#160;

and &#160;

upon &#160;

the &#160;

satisfaction &#160;

of &#160;

certain &#160;

other &#160;

conditions. &#160;

The 

Corporation also had at June 30, 2024, $39 million in bonds issued by HFA which are secured by second mortgage loans on Puerto 

Rico residential properties, and for which &#160;

HFA also provides insurance &#160;

to cover losses in the &#160;

event of a borrower default, &#160;

and upon 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

the satisfaction of certain &#160;

other conditions (December 31, 2023 &#160;

- $40 million). In &#160;

the event that the &#160;

mortgage loans insured by &#160;

HFA 

and &#160;

held &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation directly &#160;

or &#160;

those &#160;

serving &#160;

as &#160;

collateral for &#160;

the &#160;

HFA &#160;

bonds &#160;

default and &#160;

the &#160;

collateral is &#160;

insufficient &#160;

to 

satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans, HFA&#8217;s &#160;

ability to honor its insurance will depend, among other factors, on the financial 

condition &#160;

of &#160;

HFA &#160;

at &#160;

the &#160;

time &#160;

such &#160;

obligations &#160;

become &#160;

due &#160;

and &#160;

payable. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

does &#160;

not &#160;

consider &#160;

the &#160;

government 

guarantee when estimating the credit losses associated &#160;

with this portfolio. &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

commercial loan &#160;

portfolio also &#160;

includes loans &#160;

to &#160;

private borrowers &#160;

who &#160;

are service &#160;

providers, lessors, &#160;

suppliers or &#160;

have 

other relationships with the government. These borrowers could be negatively &#160;

affected by a deterioration in the fiscal and &#160;

economic 

situation &#160;

of &#160;

PR &#160;

Government &#160;

Entities. &#160;

Similarly, &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

mortgage &#160;

and &#160;

consumer &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolios &#160;

include &#160;

loans &#160;

to &#160;

government 

employees &#160;

and &#160;

retirees, &#160;

which &#160;

could &#160;

also &#160;

be &#160;

negatively &#160;

affected &#160;

by &#160;

fiscal &#160;

measures, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

employee &#160;

layoffs &#160;

or &#160;

furloughs &#160;

or 

reductions in pension benefits, if the fiscal and economic &#160;

situation deteriorates. 

As of June &#160;

30, 2024, BPPR had &#160;

$19.7 billion in deposits from &#160;

the Puerto Rico government, its &#160;

instrumentalities, and municipalities. 

The &#160;

rate &#160;

at &#160;

which &#160;

public &#160;

deposit &#160;

balances &#160;

may &#160;

decline is &#160;

uncertain and &#160;

difficult &#160;

to &#160;

predict. &#160;

The &#160;

amount &#160;

and &#160;

timing &#160;

of &#160;

any &#160;

such 

reduction is &#160;

likely to &#160;

be impacted &#160;

by, &#160;

for example, &#160;

the speed &#160;

at which &#160;

federal assistance &#160;

is distributed &#160;

and the &#160;

financial condition, 

liquidity and cash management practices of such entities, &#160;

as well as on the ability of BPPR to &#160;

maintain these customer relationships. 

United States Virgin Islands 

The &#160;

operations &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

United &#160;

States &#160;

Virgin &#160;

Islands &#160;

(the &#160;

&#8220;USVI&#8221;) &#160;

and &#160;

has &#160;

credit &#160;

exposure &#160;

to &#160;

USVI &#160;

government 

entities. 

The USVI has &#160;

been experiencing a &#160;

number of fiscal &#160;

and economic challenges, &#160;

which could adversely &#160;

affect the &#160;

ability of its &#160;

public 

corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding &#160;

debt obligations. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI &#160;

and, as such, 

there &#160;

is &#160;

currently &#160;

no &#160;

federal &#160;

legislation &#160;

permitting &#160;

the &#160;

restructuring &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

debts &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

USVI &#160;

and &#160;

its &#160;

public &#160;

corporations &#160;

and 

instrumentalities. 

To &#160;

the extent that &#160;

the fiscal condition &#160;

of the USVI &#160;

continues to deteriorate, the &#160;

U.S. Congress or the &#160;

Government of the &#160;

USVI may 

enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the &#160;

financial obligations of USVI government entities or imposing a &#160;

stay on creditor 

remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable &#160;

to the USVI. 

At June &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

had approximately &#160;

$28 million &#160;

in direct &#160;

exposure to &#160;

USVI government &#160;

entities (December &#160;

31, 

2023 - $28 million). &#160;

British Virgin Islands 

The &#160;

Corporation has &#160;

operations &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

British Virgin &#160;

Islands &#160;

(&#8220;BVI&#8221;), &#160;

which &#160;

was &#160;

negatively &#160;

affected by &#160;

the &#160;

COVID-19 &#160;

pandemic, 

particularly as &#160;

a reduction &#160;

in the &#160;

tourism activity &#160;

which accounts &#160;

for a &#160;

significant portion &#160;

of its &#160;

economy. &#160;

Although the &#160;

Corporation 

has no &#160;

significant exposure &#160;

to a &#160;

single borrower &#160;

in the &#160;

BVI, at &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2024, it &#160;

has a &#160;

loan portfolio &#160;

amounting to &#160;

approximately 

$201 million comprised of various retail and commercial &#160;

clients, compared to a loan portfolio of $205 million &#160;

at December 31, 2023. 

U.S. Government 

As further detailed in Notes &#160;

5 and 6 to the &#160;

Consolidated Financial Statements, a substantial portion of the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s investment 

securities &#160;

represented exposure &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Government in &#160;

the &#160;

form &#160;

of &#160;

U.S. Government &#160;

sponsored entities, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

agency 

mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities. In addition, $2.0 billion of residential mortgages, and $90.9 million commercial loans 

were insured &#160;

or guaranteed by &#160;

the U.S. Government &#160;

or its agencies &#160;

at June 30, &#160;

2024 (compared to &#160;

$1.9 billion &#160;

and $89.2 million, 

respectively, at December 31, 2023).

Non-Performing Assets 

Non-performing assets (&#8220;NPAs&#8221;) &#160;

include primarily past-due &#160;

loans that &#160;

are no &#160;

longer accruing interest, &#160;

renegotiated loans, and &#160;

real 

estate property acquired through foreclosure. A summary, including certain credit &#160;

quality metrics, is presented in Table 19.

2024 &#160;

improved &#160;

when &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

We &#160;

continue &#160;

However, &#160;

management believes &#160;

that &#160;

the &#160;

improvements over &#160;

recent years &#160;

in &#160;

risk management &#160;

practices and &#160;

the &#160;

profile of the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolios position Popular &#160;

to continue to operate successfully under the &#160;

current environment. 

Total &#160;

NPAs &#160;

as of &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2024 decreased &#160;

by $26 &#160;

million when &#160;

compared with &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2023. Total &#160;

non-performing loans 

held-in-portfolio &#160;

(&#8220;NPLs&#8221;) &#160;

decreased &#160;

by &#160;

$16 &#160;

million &#160;

from &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2023. &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

NPLs &#160;

decreased &#160;

by &#160;

$42 &#160;

million, &#160;

broadly 

reflected &#160;

across &#160;

most &#160;

loan &#160;

categories. &#160;

Popular &#160;

U.S. &#160;

NPLs &#160;

increased &#160;

by &#160;

$26 &#160;

million, &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

higher &#160;

commercial &#160;

NPLs &#160;

by &#160;

$27 

million, mostly impacted by a single $17 million loan. &#160;

On June 30, 2024, the ratio of NPLs to total loans held-in-portfolio was 1.0%, flat when compared to December 31, 2023. Other real 

estate owned loans (&#8220;OREOs&#8221;) &#160;

decreased by $10 million &#160;

from December 31, 2023. &#160;

The decrease in OREO &#160;

was driven by &#160;

the sale 

of a &#160;

commercial property &#160;

in BPPR. &#160;

On June &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

NPLs secured &#160;

by real &#160;

estate amounted &#160;

to $207 &#160;

million in &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico 

operations and $49 million in Popular U.S, &#160;

compared with $231 million and $24 million, respectively, on December 31, &#160;

2023. 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

commercial loan &#160;

portfolio secured &#160;

by real &#160;

estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) &#160;

amounted to &#160;

$10.5 billion &#160;

on June &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

of which 

$3.1 billion was secured with owner occupied properties, &#160;

compared with $10.6 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, on December 31, 

2023. Office space &#160;

leasing exposure in &#160;

our non-owner occupied &#160;

CRE portfolio is &#160;

limited, representing only &#160;

1.8% or $624 &#160;

million of 

our total loan portfolio. The exposure is mainly comprised of low- to mid- rise properties with average loan size of &#160;

$2.0 million and is 

well diversified across tenant type. 

CRE NPLs amounted to &#160;

$65 million on June &#160;

30, 2024, compared with &#160;

$48 million on December &#160;

31, 2023, driven by &#160;

the single $17 

million loan mentioned above. The CRE NPL &#160;

ratios for the BPPR and Popular U.S. &#160;

segments were 0.71% and 0.55%, respectively, 

on June 30, 2024, compared with 0.86% and &#160;

0.13%, respectively, on December 31, 2023. 

In addition &#160;

to the &#160;

NPLs included &#160;

in Table &#160;

19, on &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2024, there &#160;

were $624 &#160;

million of &#160;

performing loans, &#160;

mostly commercial 

loans, which in management&#8217;s opinion, are currently subject to potential future classification as non-performing (December 31, 2023 

- $510 million). 

For the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2024, total &#160;

inflows of &#160;

NPLs held-in-portfolio, &#160;

excluding consumer &#160;

loans, increased &#160;

by $18 &#160;

million, 

when compared &#160;

to the &#160;

inflows for &#160;

the same &#160;

period in &#160;

2023. Inflows &#160;

of NPLs &#160;

held-in-portfolio at &#160;

the BPPR &#160;

segment remained &#160;

flat, 

compared to the &#160;

same period in &#160;

2023. Inflows of &#160;

NPLs held-in-portfolio at the &#160;

Popular U.S. segment &#160;

increased by $17 million &#160;

from 

the same period in 2023, mainly driven by higher &#160;

commercial inflows by $18 million driven by abovementioned &#160;

$17 million loan.

[1] There were no non-performing loans held-for-sale &#160;

as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

[2] It is the Corporation&#8217;s policy to report delinquent &#160;

residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed &#160;

by the VA as accruing &#160;

loans past due 90 

days or &#160;

more as &#160;

opposed to &#160;

non-performing &#160;

since the &#160;

principal repayment &#160;

is insured. &#160;

These balances &#160;

include $81 &#160;

million of &#160;

residential &#160;

mortgage 

loans &#160;

insured &#160;

by &#160;

FHA &#160;

or &#160;

guaranteed &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

VA &#160;

that &#160;

are &#160;

no &#160;

(December &#160;

- &#160;

$106 &#160;

million). 

Furthermore, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

has approximately &#160;

$34 million &#160;

in reverse &#160;

mortgage &#160;

loans which &#160;

are &#160;

guaranteed &#160;

by &#160;

FHA, but &#160;

which are &#160;

currently &#160;

not 

accruing &#160;

interest. &#160;

Due &#160;

to &#160;

the guaranteed &#160;

nature &#160;

of &#160;

the loans, &#160;

it is &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

policy &#160;

to &#160;

exclude &#160;

these &#160;

balances &#160;

from &#160;

Loan Delinquencies 

Another key measure used to evaluate and &#160;

monitor the Corporation&#8217;s asset quality is loan &#160;

delinquencies. Loans delinquent 30 days 

or more, as a percentage of their related portfolio &#160;

category on June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, &#160;

Loans delinquent 30 days or more includes $0.4 billion &#160;

of residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed &#160;

by the VA as of June &#160;

2024 (December 31, 2023 - $0.5 billion). Refer to Note &#160;

7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional &#160;

information of guaranteed loans. 

Allowance for Credit Losses Loans Held-in-Portfolio 

The ACL, &#160;

represents management&#8217;s &#160;

estimate of &#160;

expected credit &#160;

losses through &#160;

the remaining &#160;

contractual life &#160;

of the &#160;

different loan 

segments, impacted by expected prepayments. The ACL &#160;

is maintained at a sufficient &#160;

level to provide for estimated credit &#160;

losses on 

collateral dependent loans as well as loans modified &#160;

for borrowers with financial difficulties separately from the remainder &#160;

of the loan 

portfolio. The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

management evaluates the adequacy &#160;

of the ACL &#160;

on a quarterly &#160;

basis. In this &#160;

evaluation, management 

considers current &#160;

conditions, macroeconomic &#160;

economic expectations through &#160;

a reasonable &#160;

and supportable &#160;

period, historical &#160;

loss 

experience, &#160;

portfolio composition &#160;

by &#160;

loan &#160;

type &#160;

and &#160;

risk &#160;

characteristics, &#160;

results &#160;

of &#160;

periodic credit &#160;

reviews &#160;

of &#160;

individual loans, &#160;

and 

regulatory requirements, amongst other factors. 

The Corporation must rely on &#160;

estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where &#160;

the ultimate outcome is unknown, such &#160;

as 

economic developments affecting specific &#160;

customers, industries, or markets. &#160;

Other factors that can &#160;

affect management&#8217;s estimates 

are &#160;

recalibration &#160;

of &#160;

statistical &#160;

models &#160;

used &#160;

to &#160;

calculate &#160;

lifetime &#160;

expected &#160;

losses, &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

underwriting &#160;

standards, &#160;

financial 

accounting standards and loan impairment measurements, &#160;

among others. Changes in the financial condition &#160;

of individual borrowers, 

in economic &#160;

conditions, and &#160;

in the &#160;

condition of &#160;

the various &#160;

markets in &#160;

which collateral &#160;

may be &#160;

sold, may &#160;

also affect &#160;

the required 

level of &#160;

the allowance &#160;

for credit &#160;

losses. Consequently, &#160;

the business &#160;

financial condition, &#160;

liquidity, &#160;

capital, and &#160;

results of &#160;

operations 

could also be affected. 

On June 30, 2024, the ACL was flat from December 31, 2023, at $730 million. The ACL for BPPR increased by $4 million, driven by 

higher &#160;

commercial &#160;

and &#160;

auto &#160;

loan &#160;

volume, &#160;

higher &#160;

qualitative reserves &#160;

and &#160;

changes &#160;

in credit &#160;

quality, &#160;

in &#160;

part &#160;

offset &#160;

by &#160;

changes &#160;

in 

macroeconomic scenarios and lower NCOs. In PB, the &#160;

ACL decreased by $3 million, when compared to &#160;

December 31, 2023, mainly 

driven &#160;

by &#160;

lower consumer &#160;

loan volumes. &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

ratio of &#160;

the allowance &#160;

for credit &#160;

losses to &#160;

loans held-in-portfolio &#160;

was 

2.05% on June &#160;

30, 2024, compared to &#160;

2.08% on December &#160;

31, 2023. The &#160;

ratio of the &#160;

allowance for credit losses &#160;

to NPLs held-in-

portfolio stood at 213.6%, compared to 204.0% on &#160;

December 31, 2023. 

Given that any one &#160;

economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the &#160;

Corporation leverages multiple scenarios to estimate &#160;

its ACL. The 

baseline scenario continues to be assigned the highest probability, &#160;

followed by the pessimistic scenario. The weight assigned to the 

pessimistic &#160;

scenario &#160;

decreased &#160;

during &#160;

the &#160;

first &#160;

quarter &#160;

of &#160;

2024 &#160;

in &#160;

response &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

positive &#160;

momentum &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

economy &#160;

as 

expectations for &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve achieving &#160;

a soft &#160;

landing have &#160;

improved. The &#160;

Corporation evaluates, &#160;

at least &#160;

on an &#160;

annual 

basis, the assumptions tied to the CECL accounting framework. These include &#160;

the reasonable and supportable period as well as the 

reversion window. 

The provision for &#160;

credit losses for the &#160;

period ended June 30, &#160;

2024, was $44.2 million, &#160;

compared to an expense &#160;

of $35.7 million &#160;

for 

the period &#160;

ended June &#160;

30, 2023, mostly &#160;

related to &#160;

higher NCOs &#160;

due to &#160;

credit normalization. &#160;

The provision &#160;

expense related to &#160;

the 

loans-held-in-portfolio for &#160;

the &#160;

six-month &#160;

period &#160;

ended &#160;

June &#160;

30, &#160;

2024 &#160;

was &#160;

$116.5 &#160;

million, &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

provision &#160;

expense &#160;

of 

$82.8 million for &#160;

the six-month period &#160;

ended June &#160;

30, 2023. Refer &#160;
