 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

We, like &#160;

other financial institutions, &#160;

face risks &#160;

inherent to &#160;

our business, &#160;

financial condition, liquidity, &#160;

results of &#160;

operations 

and &#160;

capital &#160;

position. &#160;

These &#160;

risks &#160;

could &#160;

cause &#160;

our &#160;

actual &#160;

results &#160;

to &#160;

differ &#160;

materially &#160;

from &#160;

our &#160;

historical &#160;

results &#160;

or &#160;

the &#160;

results 

contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained &#160;

in this report. 

The risks described in &#160;

this report are not the &#160;

only risks we face. Additional &#160;

risks and uncertainties not currently &#160;

known by 

us &#160;

or &#160;

that &#160;

we &#160;

currently &#160;

deem &#160;

to &#160;

be &#160;

immaterial, &#160;

or &#160;

that &#160;

are &#160;

generally &#160;

applicable &#160;

to &#160;

all &#160;

financial &#160;

institutions, &#160;

may &#160;

also &#160;

materially 

adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or capital &#160;

position. 

ECONOMIC AND MARKET RISKS 

Weakness in &#160;

the economy, &#160;

particularly in &#160;

Puerto Rico, &#160;

where a &#160;

significant portion &#160;

of our &#160;

business is &#160;

concentrated, has 

adversely impacted us in the past and may adversely &#160;

impact us in the future. 

We have been, and will continue to be, impacted by global and local &#160;

economic and market conditions, including weakness 

in the &#160;

economy, &#160;

disruptions and &#160;

volatility in &#160;

the financial &#160;

markets, inflation, &#160;

monetary and &#160;

fiscal policies, &#160;

public policy, &#160;

geopolitical 

conflicts, business and consumer sentiment and unemployment. A significant portion of our business is concentrated &#160;

in Puerto Rico, 

which accounted for approximately 77% of &#160;

our assets and 81% of &#160;

our deposits as of December 31, &#160;

2023 and 78% of our &#160;

revenues 

for the &#160;

year ended &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2023. As &#160;

a result, &#160;

our financial &#160;

condition and &#160;

results of &#160;

operations are &#160;

highly dependent &#160;

on the 

general &#160;

trends &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

economy &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

conditions &#160;

affecting &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

consumers &#160;

and &#160;

businesses. &#160;

The 

concentration of &#160;

our operations in &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

exposes us to &#160;

greater risks than &#160;

other banking companies &#160;

with a &#160;

wider geographic 

base. 

Puerto Rico &#160;

has faced significant &#160;

economic and fiscal &#160;

challenges in the &#160;

past, including a &#160;

severe recession that &#160;

began in 

2007 and &#160;

persisted for &#160;

over a &#160;

decade and &#160;

an acute &#160;

fiscal crisis &#160;

that led &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico government &#160;

to file &#160;

for a &#160;

form &#160;

of federal 

bankruptcy protection &#160;

in 2017. &#160;

Puerto Rico&#8217;s &#160;

fiscal and &#160;

economic challenges &#160;

have in &#160;

the past &#160;

adversely affected &#160;

our customers, 

resulting &#160;

in &#160;

higher &#160;

delinquencies, &#160;

charge-offs &#160;

and &#160;

increased &#160;

losses &#160;

for &#160;

us. &#160;

While &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico&#8217;s &#160;

economy &#160;

has &#160;

been &#160;

gradually 

recovering &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

government &#160;

emerged &#160;

from &#160;

bankruptcy &#160;

in &#160;

2022, &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

still &#160;

faces &#160;

economic &#160;

and &#160;

fiscal 

challenges. &#160;

Moreover, &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

has &#160;

historically &#160;

received &#160;

a &#160;

significant &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

federal &#160;

funds &#160;

through &#160;

non-recurring 

appropriations, particularly to cover costs associated with its health insurance program, and Puerto Rico&#8217;s recent economic recovery 

has &#160;

been partially &#160;

driven by &#160;

significant federal &#160;

disaster relief &#160;

and stimulus &#160;

funding. Therefore, &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy &#160;

is highly 

susceptible &#160;

to &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

federal &#160;

public &#160;

policy &#160;

towards &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico. &#160;

Public &#160;

policy &#160;

changes &#160;

that &#160;

result &#160;

in &#160;

a &#160;

reduction &#160;

of &#160;

federal 

funding for Puerto &#160;

Rico, or in &#160;

delays in the &#160;

receipt of such funding, &#160;

could significantly impact Puerto &#160;

Rico&#8217;s economy. &#160;

A weakening 

of the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy or other &#160;

adverse economic conditions affecting &#160;

Puerto Rico consumers and &#160;

businesses could result in 

decreased demand &#160;

for our &#160;

products or services, &#160;

deterioration in the &#160;

credit quality &#160;

of our &#160;

customers, higher &#160;

delinquencies, charge-

offs or increased losses, all of which could adversely affect &#160;

our financial condition and results of operations. 

We are &#160;

also exposed &#160;

to risks &#160;

related to &#160;

the state &#160;

of the &#160;

local economies &#160;

of the &#160;

other markets &#160;

in which &#160;

we do &#160;

business, 

such as New York and Florida, and to the state of the global and U.S. economy and financial &#160;

markets. Global financial markets have 

recently &#160;

experienced periods &#160;

of &#160;

extraordinary disruption &#160;

and volatility, &#160;

exacerbated by &#160;

geopolitical conflicts, &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

debt-ceiling 

situation, &#160;

high &#160;

levels &#160;

of &#160;

inflation &#160;

and &#160;

rapid &#160;

increases &#160;

in &#160;

interest &#160;

rates. &#160;

Inflationary &#160;

pressures &#160;

increased &#160;

certain &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

expenses 

(including our &#160;

personnel expenses) &#160;

and adversely &#160;

affected consumer &#160;

sentiment. Central &#160;

bank responses &#160;

to inflationary &#160;

pressures 

led to higher &#160;

market interest rates &#160;

and, in turn, &#160;

lower activity levels across &#160;

U.S. and global financial &#160;

markets. These circumstances 

resulted in, &#160;

and could &#160;

continue to &#160;

result in, &#160;

reductions in &#160;

the value &#160;

of &#160;

our investments. &#160;

If these &#160;

conditions persist &#160;

or worsen, &#160;

our 

results of operations, financial position and liquidity &#160;

could be materially and adversely affected. 

Changes &#160;

in &#160;

interest &#160;

rates &#160;

and &#160;

credit &#160;

spreads &#160;

can &#160;

adversely &#160;

impact &#160;

our &#160;

financial &#160;

condition, &#160;

including &#160;

our &#160;

investment 

portfolio, &#160;

since &#160;

a &#160;

significant &#160;

portion &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

business involves &#160;

borrowing &#160;

and &#160;

lending &#160;

money, &#160;

and &#160;

investing in &#160;

financial 

instruments. 

Our business &#160;

and financial &#160;

performance are &#160;

impacted by &#160;

market interest &#160;

rates and &#160;

movements in &#160;

those rates. &#160;

Since a 

high percentage of our assets and liabilities are interest bearing or otherwise sensitive in value to changes in interest rates, changes 

in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different types of rates, have had and could in the future have 

a material impact on our results &#160;

of operations and the values of our &#160;

assets and liabilities, including our investment portfolio. &#160;

Interest 

rates are &#160;

highly sensitive &#160;

to many &#160;

factors over &#160;

which we &#160;

have no &#160;

control and &#160;

which we &#160;

may not &#160;

be able &#160;

to anticipate &#160;

adequately, 

including general &#160;

economic conditions &#160;

and the &#160;

monetary and &#160;

tax policies &#160;

of various &#160;

governmental bodies, &#160;

particularly the &#160;

Federal 

Reserve Board. 

Increasing levels of inflation, driven &#160;

by pent-up demand and supply-chain disruptions caused &#160;

by the COVID-19 pandemic 

and the war in Ukraine, led &#160;

the Federal Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board &#160;

(the &#8220;FOMC&#8221;) to execute a series of sharp 

benchmark interest &#160;

rate increases &#160;

beginning in &#160;

the first &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2022. While &#160;

the &#160;

FOMC has &#160;

indicated that &#160;

it &#160;

may conclude &#160;

its 

interest rate hike cycle, the amount and pace of any reduction in interest rates remains uncertain. Higher interest rates could lead to 

fewer originations of &#160;

commercial and residential &#160;

real estate loans, &#160;

loss of deposits, &#160;

a misalignment in &#160;

the pricing of &#160;

short-term and 

long-term &#160;

borrowings, &#160;

less &#160;

liquidity &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

financial &#160;

markets &#160;

and &#160;

higher &#160;

funding &#160;

costs. &#160;

Furthermore, &#160;

higher &#160;

interest &#160;

rates &#160;

could 

negatively affect &#160;

the payment &#160;

performance on &#160;

loans linked &#160;

to variable &#160;

interest rates &#160;

to the &#160;

extent borrowers &#160;

are unable &#160;

to afford 

higher interest &#160;

payments, which &#160;

could result &#160;

in higher &#160;

delinquencies. Inflationary &#160;

pressure arising &#160;

from increases &#160;

in interest &#160;

rates 

may also affect &#160;

borrowers&#8217; financial condition and &#160;

their ability to &#160;

pay their debts &#160;

when due. Additionally, &#160;

if the interest &#160;

rates we pay 

on &#160;

our &#160;

deposits &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

borrowings &#160;

were &#160;

to &#160;

increase &#160;

at &#160;

a &#160;

faster &#160;

rate &#160;

than &#160;

the &#160;

interest &#160;

rates &#160;

we &#160;

receive &#160;

on &#160;

loans &#160;

and &#160;

other 

investments, &#160;

our &#160;

net &#160;

interest &#160;

income, &#160;

and, &#160;

therefore, &#160;

our &#160;

earnings, &#160;

could &#160;

be &#160;

adversely &#160;

affected. &#160;

All &#160;

of &#160;

these &#160;

outcomes &#160;

could 

adversely affect our earnings, liquidity and capital levels. 

The &#160;

rapid &#160;

rise &#160;

in &#160;

interest &#160;

rates &#160;

in &#160;

2022 &#160;

resulted &#160;

in &#160;

approximately &#160;

$2.5 &#160;

billion &#160;

in &#160;

unrealized &#160;

mark-to-market &#160;

losses &#160;

on 

available-for-sale securities held in our investment securities portfolio. In October 2022, we transferred U.S. Treasury securities with 

a fair value of approximately $6.5 billion (par value of &#160;

$7.4 billion), and with accumulated unrealized losses of $873 million, from our 

available-for-sale portfolio to &#160;

our held-to-maturity portfolio. &#160;

While the size &#160;

of our unrealized &#160;

mark-to-market losses on &#160;

available-for-

sale &#160;

securities &#160;

had &#160;

been &#160;

reduced &#160;

to &#160;

$1.4 &#160;

billion &#160;

as &#160;

of &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2023, &#160;

if &#160;

interest &#160;

rates &#160;

were &#160;

to &#160;

again &#160;

rise &#160;

rapidly &#160;

or &#160;

for &#160;

a 

prolonged period, we may accumulate significant additional mark-to-market &#160;

losses on investment securities in our available-for-sale 

portfolio, which may adversely affect our tangible capital &#160;

and impact our ability to return capital to our &#160;

stockholders.

BUSINESS RISKS 

Negative &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

financial &#160;

condition &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

clients &#160;

have &#160;

adversely &#160;

impacted &#160;

us &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

past &#160;

and &#160;

may &#160;

adversely 

impact us in the future. 

&#160;

A significant portion of &#160;

our business involves lending money, &#160;

which exposes us to &#160;

credit risk and &#160;

risk of loss if &#160;

borrowers 

do &#160;

not &#160;

repay &#160;

their &#160;

loans, &#160;

leases, credit &#160;

cards &#160;

or &#160;

other &#160;

credit &#160;

obligations. &#160;

The &#160;

performance of &#160;

these &#160;

credit &#160;

portfolios &#160;

significantly 

affects our &#160;

financial condition &#160;

and results &#160;

of operations. &#160;

We have &#160;

in the &#160;

past been &#160;

adversely affected &#160;

by negative &#160;

changes in &#160;

the 

financial condition of our clients due to weakness in &#160;

the Puerto Rico and U.S. economy. If the current economic environment were to 

deteriorate, more customers may have difficulty in repaying their credit obligations, which may result in higher levels &#160;

of credit losses 

and reserves for credit losses. 

We are exposed to &#160;

increased credit risks and credit losses &#160;

to the extent our clients are &#160;

concentrated by industry segment 

or type of client. 

Our credit risk and credit &#160;

losses can increase to the extent &#160;

our loans are concentrated in borrowers engaged in &#160;

the same 

or similar &#160;

activities or &#160;

in borrowers &#160;

who as &#160;

a group &#160;

may be &#160;

uniquely or &#160;

disproportionately affected &#160;

by certain &#160;

economic or &#160;

market 

conditions. We have significant &#160;

exposure to borrowers in certain &#160;

economic sectors, such as residential &#160;

and commercial real estate, 

hospitality and healthcare. Challenging economic or market conditions that affect &#160;

the industries or types of clients to &#160;

which we have 

significant exposure could result in higher credit &#160;

losses and adversely affect our financial condition &#160;

and results of operations. 

We also &#160;

have direct &#160;

lending and &#160;

investment exposure &#160;

to Puerto &#160;

Rico government &#160;

entities, which &#160;

have faced &#160;

significant 

fiscal challenges. &#160;

At December &#160;

31, 2023, &#160;

our exposure &#160;

to the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

government consisted &#160;

of $362 &#160;

million in &#160;

direct lending 

exposure to Puerto &#160;

Rico municipalities and &#160;

$238 million in &#160;

loans insured or &#160;

securities issued by &#160;

Puerto Rico governmental &#160;

entities 

but for &#160;

which the &#160;

principal source &#160;

of repayment &#160;

is non-governmental. &#160;

We also &#160;

have indirect &#160;

lending exposure &#160;

to the &#160;

Puerto Rico 

government in the &#160;

form of loans &#160;

to private borrowers &#160;

who are service &#160;

providers, lessors, suppliers &#160;

or have other &#160;

relationships with 

the Puerto Rico government. While the overall fiscal situation &#160;

of the Puerto Rico government has improved in recent years, &#160;

including 

as &#160;

result &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

government &#160;

and &#160;

certain &#160;

of &#160;

its &#160;

instrumentalities &#160;

having &#160;

restructured &#160;

their &#160;

debt &#160;

obligations, &#160;

some &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico 

government entities, including certain municipalities, still face significant &#160;

fiscal challenges. A deterioration in the fiscal situation of the 

Puerto Rico &#160;

government and its &#160;

instrumentalities, and in &#160;

particular in the &#160;

fiscal situation &#160;

of the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

municipalities to &#160;

which 

we have direct lending exposure, could result in &#160;

higher credit losses and reserves for credit losses. For &#160;

a discussion of risks related 

to the Corporation&#8217;s credit exposure to the Puerto Rico &#160;

and USVI governments, see the Geographic and &#160;

Government Risk section in 

the MD&#38;A section of this Form 10-K. 

Deterioration in the &#160;

values of real &#160;

properties securing our commercial, mortgage &#160;

loan and construction portfolios &#160;

have in 

the past resulted, and may in the future result, &#160;

in increased credit losses and harm our results &#160;

of operations.

As of &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2023, approximately &#160;

55% of &#160;

our loan &#160;

portfolio consisted &#160;

of loans &#160;

secured by &#160;

real estate &#160;

collateral 

(comprised of 30% in commercial loans, 22% in residential &#160;

mortgage loans and 3% in construction loans). The &#160;

value of the collateral 

securing such loans is dependent upon economic conditions in the area in which the collateral is located. Weakness in the economy 

of some of the &#160;

markets we serve has in &#160;

the past resulted in significant &#160;

declines in the value of &#160;

the real properties securing our &#160;

loan 

portfolio, leading to increased credit losses. If the value of &#160;

the real estate properties securing our loan portfolio declines again in &#160;

the 

future, we may be &#160;

required to increase our &#160;

provisions for loan losses &#160;

and allowance for loan &#160;

losses. Any such increase could &#160;

have 

an adverse effect on &#160;

our financial condition and results of &#160;

operations. For more information on the credit &#160;

quality of our construction, 

commercial and mortgage portfolio, see the Credit &#160;

Risk section of the MD&#38;A included in this &#160;

Form 10-K.

We &#160;

are &#160;

exposed &#160;

to &#160;

credit &#160;

risk &#160;

from &#160;

mortgage &#160;

loans &#160;

that &#160;

have &#160;

been &#160;

sold &#160;

or &#160;

are &#160;

being &#160;

serviced &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

recourse 

arrangements. 

Popular &#160;

is &#160;

generally &#160;

at &#160;

risk &#160;

for &#160;

mortgage &#160;

loan &#160;

defaults &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

time &#160;

it &#160;

funds &#160;

a &#160;

loan &#160;

until &#160;

the &#160;

time &#160;

the &#160;

loan &#160;

is &#160;

sold &#160;

or 

securitized into a &#160;

mortgage-backed security. &#160;

However, we &#160;

have retained part &#160;

of the credit &#160;

risk on sales &#160;

of mortgage loans &#160;

through 

recourse &#160;

arrangements, &#160;

and &#160;

we &#160;

also &#160;

service &#160;

certain &#160;

mortgage &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolios &#160;

with &#160;

recourse. &#160;

At &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2023, &#160;

we &#160;

were 

exposed to credit risk with respect to $0.6 billion in residential mortgage loans sold &#160;

or serviced subject to credit recourse provisions, 

consisting principally of loans associated with the Fannie Mae and &#160;

Freddie Mac programs. Pursuant to such recourse provisions, &#160;

we 

are required to repurchase the loan or reimburse the third-party investor for the incurred loss in the event of a customer default. The 

maximum potential amount of future payments that &#160;

we would be required to make &#160;

under the recourse arrangements in the event &#160;

of 

nonperformance &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

borrowers &#160;

is &#160;

equivalent &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

total &#160;

outstanding balance &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

residential mortgage &#160;

loans &#160;

serviced &#160;

with 

recourse &#160;

and &#160;

interest, if &#160;

applicable. In &#160;

the &#160;

event &#160;

of &#160;

nonperformance by &#160;

the borrower, &#160;

we &#160;

have &#160;

rights &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

underlying collateral 

securing the &#160;

mortgage loan. &#160;

During 2023, &#160;

we repurchased &#160;

approximately $2 &#160;

million in &#160;

mortgage loans &#160;

subject to &#160;

credit recourse 

provisions. As &#160;

of December &#160;

31, 2023, &#160;

our liability &#160;

established to &#160;

cover the &#160;

estimated credit &#160;

loss exposure &#160;

related to &#160;

loans sold &#160;

or 

serviced with credit recourse amounted to $4 million. We may suffer losses on these loans if the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of 

the property underlying &#160;

a defaulted mortgage &#160;

loan are less &#160;

than the outstanding &#160;

principal balance of &#160;

the loan plus &#160;

any uncollected 

interest advanced and the costs of holding and disposing &#160;

of the related property. 

Defective and repurchased loans may harm our business &#160;

and financial condition. 

In &#160;

connection &#160;

with &#160;

the &#160;

sale &#160;

and &#160;

securitization &#160;

of &#160;

mortgage &#160;

loans, &#160;

we &#160;

are &#160;

required &#160;

to &#160;

make &#160;

a &#160;

variety &#160;

of &#160;

customary 

representations &#160;

and &#160;

warranties regarding &#160;

Popular &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

loans &#160;

being &#160;

sold &#160;

or &#160;

securitized. &#160;

Our &#160;

obligations with &#160;

respect to &#160;

these 

representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the &#160;

life of the loan, and they &#160;

relate to, among other things, compliance 

with &#160;

laws &#160;

and &#160;

regulations, &#160;

underwriting &#160;

standards, &#160;

the &#160;

accuracy &#160;

of &#160;

information &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

loan &#160;

documents &#160;

and &#160;

loan &#160;

file &#160;

and &#160;

the 

characteristics &#160;

and &#160;

enforceability of &#160;

the &#160;

loan. &#160;

A &#160;

loan &#160;

that &#160;

does &#160;

not &#160;

comply &#160;

with &#160;

the &#160;

secondary &#160;

market&#8217;s &#160;

requirements &#160;

may &#160;

take 

longer to &#160;

sell, impact &#160;

our ability &#160;

to securitize &#160;

the loans &#160;

or pledge &#160;

the loans &#160;

as collateral &#160;

for borrowings, &#160;

or be &#160;

unsalable or &#160;

salable 

only &#160;

at &#160;

a &#160;

significant &#160;

discount. &#160;

Moreover, &#160;

if &#160;

any &#160;

such &#160;

loan &#160;

is &#160;

sold &#160;

before &#160;

we &#160;

detect &#160;

non-compliance, &#160;

we &#160;

may &#160;

be &#160;

obligated &#160;

to 

repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, &#160;

or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss. &#160;

We 

seek to &#160;

minimize repurchases and &#160;

losses from defective &#160;

loans by correcting &#160;

flaws, if possible, &#160;

and selling or &#160;

re-selling such loans. 

However, &#160;

if &#160;

we &#160;

were &#160;

to &#160;

suffer &#160;

significant &#160;

losses &#160;

from &#160;

defective &#160;

and &#160;

repurchased &#160;

loans, &#160;

our &#160;

results &#160;

of &#160;

operations &#160;

and &#160;

financial 

condition could be materially impacted. 

If we are &#160;

unable to maintain &#160;

or grow our &#160;

deposits, we may &#160;

be subject to &#160;

paying higher funding costs &#160;

and our net &#160;

interest 

income may decrease. 

&#160;

We rely primarily &#160;

on bank deposits as &#160;

a low cost and &#160;

stable source of funding &#160;

for our lending activities &#160;

and the operation 

of &#160;

our &#160;

business. &#160;

Therefore, &#160;

our &#160;

funding &#160;

costs &#160;

are &#160;

largely &#160;

dependent &#160;

on &#160;

our &#160;

ability &#160;

to &#160;

maintain &#160;

and &#160;

grow &#160;

our &#160;

deposits. &#160;

As &#160;

our 

competitors have raised the &#160;

interest rates they pay &#160;

on deposits, our &#160;

funding costs have increased, &#160;

as we have &#160;

needed to increase 

the rates we &#160;

pay to our depositors &#160;

to avoid losing deposits &#160;

and to procure new &#160;

ones. Rising interest rates &#160;

have also led customers 

to move their funds to alternative investments that &#160;

pay higher interest rates. &#160;

Additionally, periods of market stress &#160;

or lack of market 

or customer confidence in financial institutions may result in &#160;

a loss of customer deposits, especially to the &#160;

extent those deposits are 

in excess of the FDIC-insured limit of $250,000. As of &#160;

December 31, 2023, we had $14.6 billion of deposits (other &#160;

than collateralized 

public funds, which represent public deposit balances from governmental entities in the U.S. and its territories, including Puerto Rico 

and the United States Virgin Islands, that are collateralized based on such jurisdictions&#8217; &#160;

applicable collateral requirements) in excess 

of the FDIC-insured limit. As deposits decrease, we &#160;

may need to rely on more &#160;

expensive sources of funding. Furthermore, we have 

a &#160;

significant &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

deposits &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

government, &#160;

its &#160;

instrumentalities &#160;

and &#160;

municipalities &#160;

($18.1 &#160;

billion, &#160;

or 

approximately 28% of our &#160;

total deposits, as of &#160;

December 31, 2023), and &#160;

the amount of these &#160;

deposits may fluctuate depending on 

the financial &#160;

condition and &#160;

liquidity of &#160;

these entities, &#160;

as well &#160;

as on &#160;

our ability &#160;

to maintain &#160;

these customer &#160;

relationships. Under &#160;

the 

terms of &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s deposit &#160;

pricing agreement &#160;

with Puerto &#160;

Rico public &#160;

sector, &#160;

public fund &#160;

deposit rates &#160;

are market &#160;

linked with &#160;

a lag 

minus a &#160;

specified spread. &#160;

Therefore, as &#160;

market rates &#160;

rise, we &#160;

are required &#160;

to sequentially &#160;

increase the &#160;

rates we &#160;

pay our &#160;

public 

deposits. If &#160;

we are unable &#160;

to maintain or &#160;

grow our deposits &#160;

for any &#160;

reason, we may &#160;

be subject to &#160;

paying higher funding &#160;

costs and 

our net interest income may decrease. 

OPERATIONAL RISKS 

We &#160;

and our &#160;

third-party providers &#160;

have been, &#160;

and expect &#160;

in the &#160;

future to &#160;

continue to &#160;

be, subject &#160;

to cyber-attacks, &#160;

which 

could cause substantial harm and have an adverse &#160;

effect on our business and results of operations. 

Cybersecurity &#160;

risks &#160;

for &#160;

large &#160;

financial &#160;

institutions &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

Popular &#160;

have &#160;

increased &#160;

significantly &#160;

in &#160;

recent &#160;

years &#160;

in &#160;

part 

because of &#160;

the proliferation &#160;

of new &#160;

technologies, such &#160;

as mobile &#160;

banking, artificial &#160;

intelligence and &#160;

the ability &#160;

to conduct &#160;

instant 

financial transactions anywhere &#160;

globally, growing &#160;

geo-political threats, such &#160;

as the ongoing &#160;

wars in Ukraine &#160;

and in the &#160;

Gaza Strip, 

and the increased sophistication and activities of &#160;

organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, hacktivists and other parties. In 

the ordinary &#160;

course of &#160;

business, we &#160;

rely on &#160;

electronic communications &#160;

and information &#160;

systems to &#160;

conduct our &#160;

operations and &#160;

to 

transmit &#160;

and &#160;

store &#160;

sensitive &#160;

data. &#160;

We &#160;

employ &#160;

a &#160;

layered &#160;

defensive approach &#160;

that &#160;

employs &#160;

people, processes &#160;

and &#160;

technology &#160;

to 

manage and &#160;

maintain cybersecurity &#160;

controls through &#160;

a variety &#160;

of preventative &#160;

and detective &#160;

tools that &#160;

monitor, block, &#160;

and provide 

alerts &#160;

regarding suspicious &#160;

activity &#160;

and &#160;

identify suspected &#160;

advanced persistent &#160;

threats. &#160;

Notwithstanding our &#160;

defensive measures 

and &#160;

the &#160;

significant &#160;

resources &#160;

we &#160;

devote &#160;

to &#160;

protect &#160;

the &#160;

security &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

systems, &#160;

there &#160;

is &#160;

no &#160;

assurance &#160;

that &#160;

all &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

security 

measures will be effective at all times, especially as the threats from cyber-attacks are continuous and severe. The risk of a security 

breach due &#160;

to a &#160;

cyber-attack could &#160;

increase in &#160;

the future &#160;

as we &#160;

continue to &#160;

expand our &#160;

mobile banking &#160;

and other &#160;

internet-based 

product &#160;

offerings, &#160;

the &#160;

use &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

cloud &#160;

for &#160;

system &#160;

development &#160;

and &#160;

hosting &#160;

and &#160;

internal &#160;

use &#160;

of &#160;

internet-based &#160;

products &#160;

and 

applications. 

We &#160;

continue to &#160;

detect and &#160;

identify attacks &#160;

that are &#160;

becoming more &#160;

sophisticated and &#160;

increasing in &#160;

volume, as &#160;

well as 

attackers &#160;

that &#160;

respond &#160;

rapidly &#160;

to &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

defensive &#160;

countermeasures. The &#160;

most &#160;

significant &#160;

cyber-attack &#160;

risks &#160;

that &#160;

we &#160;

or &#160;

our 

critical service providers may face include, but are not limited to, &#160;

e-fraud, denial-of-service (DDoS), ransomware, computer intrusion 

and &#160;

the &#160;

exploitation of &#160;

software zero-day &#160;

vulnerabilities that &#160;

might result &#160;

in &#160;

disruption of &#160;

services &#160;

and in &#160;

the &#160;

exposure or &#160;

loss of 

customer &#160;

or &#160;

proprietary &#160;

data. &#160;

Loss &#160;

from &#160;

e-fraud &#160;

occurs &#160;

when &#160;

cybercriminals &#160;

compromise &#160;

our &#160;

systems &#160;

or &#160;

the &#160;

systems &#160;

of &#160;

our 

customers and extract &#160;

funds from customer&#8217;s &#160;

credit cards or &#160;

bank accounts, including &#160;

through brute force, &#160;

password spraying and 

credential &#160;

stuffing &#160;

attacks &#160;

directed &#160;

at &#160;

gaining &#160;

unauthorized &#160;

access &#160;

to &#160;

individual &#160;

accounts. &#160;

Denial-of-service &#160;

attacks &#160;

intentionally 

disrupt &#160;

the &#160;

ability &#160;

of &#160;

legitimate &#160;

users, &#160;

including &#160;

customers &#160;

and &#160;

employees, &#160;

to &#160;

access &#160;

networks, &#160;

websites &#160;

and &#160;

online &#160;

resources. 

Computer intrusion attempts either direct or through social engineering (pretext calls), supply chain compromise, email, text or voice 

messages, including using brand impersonation (regularly referred &#160;

to as phishing, vishing, smishing &#160;

and quishing), have resulted in 

and may continue to result in the compromise of sensitive customer data, such as account numbers, credit cards and social security 

numbers, &#160;

and &#160;

could &#160;

present &#160;

significant &#160;

reputational, legal &#160;

and &#160;

regulatory costs &#160;

to &#160;

Popular &#160;

if &#160;

successful. &#160;

The &#160;

emergence of &#160;

new 

technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum &#160;

computing are further expected to exacerbate &#160;

the risk of cyber-attacks. &#160;

Our &#160;

customer-facing &#160;

platforms &#160;

are &#160;

also &#160;

routinely &#160;

attacked &#160;

by &#160;

threat &#160;

actors &#160;

aiming &#160;

to &#160;

gain &#160;

unauthorized &#160;

access &#160;

to &#160;

our 

clients&#8217; accounts. &#160;

Popular has &#160;

recently implemented &#160;

certain defensive &#160;

measures in &#160;

response to &#160;

brute force &#160;

attacks on &#160;

one of &#160;

our 

platforms which resulted in certain &#160;

of our customers log-in credentials &#160;

and information being exposed. As &#160;

a result, Popular notified, 

as required &#160;

or otherwise &#160;

deemed appropriate, &#160;

customers identified &#160;

as affected &#160;

by the &#160;

incident. We &#160;

have to &#160;

date not &#160;

experienced 

material losses in connection with these attacks. Cyber-security risks have also been recently exacerbated by the discovery of zero-

day vulnerabilities in widely distributed third party software, &#160;

such as the vulnerability identified in the Apache &#160;

log4j in December 2021 

and in the MOVEit file transfer application in &#160;

May 2023, which could affect Popular&#8217;s or any &#160;

of its service provider&#8217;s systems. 

The &#160;

increased &#160;

use &#160;

of &#160;

remote &#160;

access &#160;

and &#160;

third-party &#160;

video &#160;

conferencing &#160;

solutions &#160;

to &#160;

enable &#160;

work-from-home 

arrangements for employees and facilitate &#160;

the use of digital &#160;

channels by our customers, &#160;

has also increased our &#160;

exposure to cyber-

attacks. In &#160;

addition, a &#160;

third party &#160;

could misappropriate &#160;

confidential information &#160;

obtained by &#160;

intercepting signals &#160;

or communications 

from mobile devices &#160;

used by Popular&#8217;s customers &#160;

or employees. Recent events, &#160;

including the wars &#160;

in Ukraine and &#160;

the Gaza Strip, 

have also &#160;

illustrated increased &#160;

geo-political factors &#160;

and the &#160;

risks related &#160;

to supply-chain &#160;

compromises and &#160;

de-stabilizing activities 

linked to &#160;

nation-state sponsored &#160;

activity as &#160;

an increasing &#160;

trend to &#160;

monitor actively. &#160;

Risks and &#160;

exposures related &#160;

to cyber &#160;

security 

attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to &#160;

the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, 

including the &#160;

rise in &#160;

the use &#160;

of cyber-attacks &#160;

as geopolitical &#160;

weapons. Although &#160;

we are &#160;

regularly targeted &#160;

by unauthorized &#160;

threat-

actor activity, including denial-of-service attacks, we have not, to date, experienced &#160;

any material losses as a result of cyber-attacks. &#160;

A material compromise or circumvention of the security of our systems could &#160;

have serious negative consequences for us, 

including &#160;

significant &#160;

disruption &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

operations &#160;

and &#160;

those &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

clients, &#160;

customers &#160;

and &#160;

counterparties, &#160;

misappropriation &#160;

of 

confidential information &#160;

of us &#160;

or that &#160;

of our &#160;

clients, customers, &#160;

counterparties or &#160;

employees, or &#160;

damage to &#160;

computers or &#160;

systems 

used &#160;

by &#160;

us &#160;

or &#160;

by &#160;

our &#160;

clients, &#160;

customers &#160;

and &#160;

counterparties, &#160;

and &#160;

could &#160;

result &#160;

in &#160;

violations &#160;

of &#160;

applicable &#160;

privacy &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

laws, 

financial loss &#160;

to us &#160;

or to &#160;

our customers, &#160;

loss of &#160;

confidence in &#160;

our security &#160;

measures, customer &#160;

dissatisfaction, significant litigation 

exposure and harm to &#160;

our reputation, all of &#160;

which could have a &#160;

material adverse effect &#160;

on us. For example, &#160;

if personal, non-public, 

confidential &#160;

or &#160;

proprietary &#160;

information &#160;

in &#160;

our &#160;

possession &#160;

were &#160;

to &#160;

be &#160;

mishandled, &#160;

misused &#160;

or &#160;

stolen, &#160;

we &#160;

could &#160;

suffer &#160;

significant 

regulatory consequences, reputational damage &#160;

and financial loss. &#160;

Such mishandling, misuse &#160;

or misappropriation could include, &#160;

for 

example, if such information &#160;

were provided to parties &#160;

who are not permitted &#160;

to have the &#160;

information, either by fault &#160;

of our systems, 

by our employees &#160;

or counterparties, or &#160;

where such information &#160;

is intercepted or &#160;

otherwise inappropriately taken by &#160;

our employees 

or third parties. 

The &#160;

extent &#160;

of &#160;

a &#160;

particular &#160;

cyber-attack &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

steps &#160;

that &#160;

we &#160;

may &#160;

need &#160;

to &#160;

take &#160;

to &#160;

investigate &#160;

the &#160;

attack &#160;

may &#160;

not &#160;

be 

immediately &#160;

clear, &#160;

and &#160;

it &#160;

may &#160;

take &#160;

a &#160;

significant &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

time &#160;

before &#160;

such &#160;

an &#160;

investigation &#160;

can &#160;

be &#160;

completed. &#160;

While &#160;

such &#160;

an 

investigation is ongoing, Popular may not necessarily know the full extent &#160;

of the harm caused by the cyber-attack, and that &#160;

damage 

may continue to spread. &#160;

These factors may inhibit &#160;

our ability to provide &#160;

rapid, full and reliable &#160;

information about the cyber-attack to 

our clients, &#160;

customers, counterparties &#160;

and regulators, &#160;

as well &#160;

as the &#160;

public. Moreover, &#160;

new regulations may &#160;

require us &#160;

to disclose 

information about a cybersecurity event before &#160;

it has been resolved or &#160;

fully investigated. Furthermore, it may not &#160;

be clear how best 

to &#160;

contain &#160;

and &#160;

remediate &#160;

the &#160;

potential &#160;

harm &#160;

caused &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

cyber-attack, &#160;

and &#160;

certain &#160;

errors &#160;

or &#160;

actions &#160;

could &#160;

be &#160;

repeated &#160;

or 

compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Cyber-attacks could cause interruptions &#160;

in our operations and result in the 

incurrence &#160;

of &#160;

significant &#160;

costs, &#160;

including those &#160;

related &#160;

to &#160;

forensic analysis &#160;

and &#160;

legal counsel, &#160;

each of &#160;

which may &#160;

be &#160;

required to 

ascertain the extent &#160;

of any potential &#160;

harm to our &#160;

customers, or employees, or &#160;

damage to our information &#160;

systems and any &#160;

legal or 

regulatory obligations that &#160;

may result therefrom. &#160;

Any cyber incidents &#160;

could also result &#160;

in, among other &#160;

things, increased regulatory 

scrutiny &#160;

and adverse &#160;

regulatory or &#160;

civil &#160;

litigation consequences. &#160;

For a &#160;

discussion of &#160;

the guidance &#160;

and rules &#160;

that federal &#160;

banking 

regulators &#160;

have &#160;

released &#160;

or &#160;

proposed &#160;

regarding &#160;

cybersecurity &#160;

and &#160;

cyber &#160;

risk &#160;

management &#160;

standards, &#160;

Business, &#160;

included in &#160;

the &#160;

Form 10-K &#160;

for the &#160;

year &#160;

ended December &#160;

31, &#160;

2023. Any &#160;

or &#160;

all &#160;

of &#160;

the 

foregoing factors could further increase the impact &#160;

of the incident and thereby the costs and consequences &#160;

of a cyber-attack. &#160;

We also &#160;

rely on &#160;

third parties &#160;

for the &#160;

performance of &#160;

a significant &#160;

portion of &#160;

our information &#160;

technology functions and &#160;

the 

provision of information security, &#160;

technology and business process services. As a result, a &#160;

successful compromise or circumvention 

of &#160;

the security &#160;

of &#160;

the systems &#160;

of these &#160;

third-party service &#160;

providers could &#160;

have serious &#160;

negative consequences &#160;

for us, &#160;

including 

compromise &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

systems, &#160;

misappropriation of &#160;

our &#160;

confidential &#160;

information &#160;

or &#160;

that &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

clients, &#160;

customers, &#160;

counterparties &#160;

or 

employees, &#160;

or &#160;

other &#160;

negative &#160;

implications &#160;

identified &#160;

above &#160;

with &#160;

respect &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

cyber-attack &#160;

on &#160;

our &#160;

systems, &#160;

which &#160;

could &#160;

have &#160;

a 

material &#160;

adverse effect &#160;

on &#160;

us. &#160;

Cyber-attacks at &#160;

third-party service &#160;

providers &#160;

are &#160;

also &#160;

becoming increasingly &#160;

common, &#160;

and, &#160;

as &#160;

a 

result, cybersecurity risks relating to our vendors have &#160;

increased. The most important of these third-party service providers &#160;

for us is 

Evertec. Certain risks particular to Evertec and &#160;

our dependence on third parties are discussed &#160;

under &#8220;We rely on other companies to 

provide key components of our business infrastructure, including certain of our core financial transaction processing and information 

technology and &#160;

security services, which &#160;

exposes us &#160;

to a &#160;

number of operational &#160;

risks that &#160;

could have &#160;

a material &#160;

adverse effect &#160;

on 

us&#8221; &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

Operational &#160;

Risks &#160;

section &#160;

of &#160;

Item &#160;

1A &#160;

in &#160;

this &#160;

Form &#160;

10-K. &#160;

During &#160;

2021, &#160;

we &#160;

determined &#160;

that, &#160;

as &#160;

a &#160;

result &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

widely 

reported breach of &#160;

Accellion, Inc.&#8217;s File &#160;

Transfer Appliance tool, &#160;

which was being &#160;

used at the time &#160;

of such breach &#160;

by a U.S.-based 

third-party advisory services vendor of &#160;

Popular, personal information of &#160;

certain Popular customers was compromised. During &#160;

2023, 

personal information of Popular customer data was compromised in a data breach incident that impacted MOVEit, the third-party file 

transfer &#160;

platform &#160;

used &#160;

by &#160;

one &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

services &#160;

providers. &#160;

In &#160;

both &#160;

instances, &#160;

Popular &#160;

notified, &#160;

as &#160;

required &#160;

or &#160;

otherwise &#160;

deemed 

appropriate, customers identified &#160;

as affected &#160;

by the incident. &#160;

Although these incidents &#160;

did not have &#160;

a material effect &#160;

on Popular or 

its financial condition, &#160;

our networks and &#160;

systems were not &#160;

impacted, and our third-party &#160;

service providers agreed to &#160;

cover external 

remediation &#160;

costs &#160;

associated &#160;

therewith, &#160;

a &#160;

compromise &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

personal &#160;

information &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

customers &#160;

maintained &#160;

by &#160;

third &#160;

party 

vendors &#160;

could &#160;

result &#160;

in &#160;

significant &#160;

regulatory &#160;

consequences, &#160;

reputational &#160;

damage &#160;

and &#160;

financial &#160;

loss &#160;

to &#160;

us.The &#160;

success &#160;

of &#160;

our 

business depends &#160;

in part &#160;

on the &#160;

continuing ability &#160;

of these &#160;

(and other) &#160;

third parties &#160;

to perform &#160;

these functions &#160;

and services &#160;

in a 

timely &#160;

and &#160;

satisfactory &#160;

manner, &#160;

which &#160;

performance &#160;

could &#160;

be &#160;

disrupted &#160;

or &#160;

otherwise &#160;

adversely &#160;

affected &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

failures &#160;

or &#160;

other 

information security &#160;

events originating at &#160;

the third &#160;

parties or at &#160;

the third parties&#8217; &#160;

suppliers or vendors &#160;

(so-called &#8220;fourth party &#160;

risk&#8221;). 

We &#160;

may &#160;

not &#160;

be &#160;

able &#160;

to &#160;

effectively &#160;

directly &#160;

monitor &#160;

or &#160;

mitigate &#160;

fourth-party &#160;

risk, &#160;

in &#160;

particular &#160;

as &#160;

it &#160;

relates &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

use &#160;

of &#160;

common 

suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform &#160;

functions and services for us. &#160;

As &#160;

cyber &#160;

threats &#160;

continue &#160;

to &#160;

evolve, &#160;

we &#160;

expect &#160;

to &#160;

expend &#160;

significant &#160;

additional &#160;

resources &#160;

to &#160;

continue &#160;

to &#160;

modify &#160;

or 

enhance our &#160;

layers of &#160;

defense or &#160;

to investigate &#160;

and remediate &#160;

additional information &#160;

security vulnerabilities &#160;

or incidents. &#160;

System 

enhancements and &#160;

updates also &#160;

create risks &#160;

associated with &#160;

implementing new &#160;

systems and &#160;

integrating them &#160;

with existing &#160;

ones, 

including risks associated with supply chain compromises &#160;

and the software development lifecycle of the &#160;

systems used by us and our 

service providers. Due &#160;

to the complexity &#160;

and interconnectedness of information &#160;

technology systems, the &#160;

process of enhancing &#160;

our 

layers &#160;

of &#160;

defense can &#160;

itself &#160;

create &#160;

a &#160;

risk &#160;

of &#160;

systems &#160;

disruptions &#160;

and &#160;

security &#160;

issues. &#160;

In &#160;

addition, &#160;

addressing &#160;

certain &#160;

information 

security vulnerabilities, such as &#160;

hardware-based vulnerabilities, may affect &#160;

the performance of our &#160;

information technology systems. 

The ability of our &#160;

hardware and software providers to deliver &#160;

patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities &#160;

in a timely manner &#160;

can 

introduce additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors. Moreover, &#160;

our efforts to timely 

mitigate vulnerabilities and &#160;

manage such risks, &#160;

given the rise &#160;

in number and &#160;

urgency of &#160;

required patches and &#160;

third-party software, 

including &#8220;zero-day vulnerabilities&#8221;, as &#160;

well as the obsolescence &#160;

in some of our &#160;

hardware and software, may &#160;

impact our day-to-day 

operations, &#160;

the &#160;

availability &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

systems &#160;

and &#160;

delay &#160;

the &#160;

deployment &#160;

of &#160;

technology &#160;

enhancements &#160;

and &#160;

innovation. &#160;

The 

obsolescence in any of our hardware or &#160;

software may limit our ability to mitigate vulnerabilities. 

If Popular&#8217;s operational systems, &#160;

or those of &#160;

external parties on which &#160;

Popular&#8217;s businesses depend, are &#160;

unable to meet 

the requirements of our &#160;

businesses and operations or bank &#160;

regulatory standards, or if they &#160;

fail, have other significant &#160;

shortcomings 

or are impacted by cyber-attacks, Popular could &#160;

be materially and adversely affected. 

Unforeseen or &#160;

catastrophic events, &#160;

including &#160;

extreme weather &#160;

events and &#160;

other natural &#160;

disasters, man-made &#160;

disasters, 

acts of violence or &#160;

war, or the &#160;

emergence of pandemics or epidemics, could &#160;

cause a disruption in our &#160;

operations or other 

consequences that could have a material adverse &#160;

effect on our financial condition and results &#160;

of operations. 

A

significant &#160;

portion &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

operations &#160;

are &#160;

located &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

Caribbean &#160;

and &#160;

Florida, &#160;

a &#160;

region &#160;

susceptible &#160;

to &#160;

hurricanes, 

earthquakes and other &#160;

similar events. In &#160;

2017, Puerto Rico, &#160;

USVI and BVI &#160;

were severely impacted &#160;

by Hurricanes Irma &#160;

and Mar&#237;a, 

which resulted in significant disruption to our operations and adversely affected &#160;

our clients in these markets, and in 2022, Hurricane 

Fiona impacted the &#160;

southwest area of &#160;

Puerto Rico, &#160;

adversely affecting our &#160;

customers in &#160;

that region. Other &#160;

types of &#160;

unforeseen or 

catastrophic events, including &#160;

pandemics, epidemics, man-made &#160;

disasters, or acts &#160;

of violence or &#160;

war, or &#160;

the fear that &#160;

such events 

could &#160;

occur, &#160;

could &#160;

also &#160;

adversely &#160;

impact &#160;

our &#160;

operations &#160;

and &#160;

financial &#160;

results. &#160;

For &#160;

example, &#160;

in &#160;

2020, &#160;

the &#160;

COVID-19 &#160;

pandemic 

severely &#160;

impacted &#160;

global &#160;

health, &#160;

financial &#160;

markets, &#160;

consumer &#160;

spending &#160;

and &#160;

global &#160;

economic &#160;

conditions, &#160;

and &#160;

caused &#160;

significant 

disruption &#160;

to &#160;

businesses worldwide, &#160;

including &#160;

our &#160;

business &#160;

and &#160;

those &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

customers, service &#160;

providers &#160;

and &#160;

suppliers. &#160;

Future 

unforeseen or &#160;

catastrophic events, &#160;

including new &#160;

pandemic events, and &#160;

actions taken &#160;

by governmental authorities &#160;

and other third 

parties in &#160;

response to such &#160;

events, could again &#160;

adversely affect &#160;

our operations, cause &#160;

economic and market &#160;

disruption, adversely 

impact the ability of borrowers to &#160;

timely repay their loans, or affect &#160;

the value of any collateral &#160;

held by us, any of which &#160;

could have a 

material adverse &#160;

effect on &#160;

our business, &#160;

financial condition &#160;

or results &#160;

of operations. &#160;

The frequency, &#160;

severity and &#160;

impact of &#160;

future 

unforeseen or catastrophic events is difficult to &#160;

predict. While we maintain insurance against natural disasters and other unforeseen 

events, including coverage &#160;

for business interruption, &#160;

the insurance may &#160;

not be sufficient &#160;

to cover all &#160;

of the &#160;

damage from any &#160;

such 

event, and there is no insurance against the disruption that a catastrophic event could produce to the markets that we serve and the 

potential negative impact to economic activity. 

Climate change could have a material adverse &#160;

impact on our business operations and that &#160;

of our clients and customers. 

Our business and &#160;

the activities and &#160;

operations of our &#160;

clients and customers &#160;

may be disrupted &#160;

by global climate &#160;

change. 

Potential physical risks &#160;

from climate change &#160;

include the increase &#160;

in the &#160;

frequency and severity &#160;

of weather &#160;

events, such as &#160;

storms 

and &#160;

hurricanes, &#160;

and &#160;

long-term &#160;

shifts &#160;

in &#160;

climate &#160;

patterns, such &#160;

as &#160;

sustained &#160;

higher &#160;

and &#160;

lower &#160;

temperatures, &#160;

sea &#160;

level &#160;

rise, &#160;

heat 

waves &#160;

and &#160;

droughts, &#160;

among &#160;

others. &#160;

Our &#160;

geographic &#160;

concentration &#160;

in &#160;

localities, &#160;

including &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico, &#160;

the &#160;

U.S.V.I., &#160;

B.V.I. &#160;

and 

Florida, particularly &#160;

susceptible to &#160;

risks arising &#160;

from climate &#160;

change, including &#160;

severe hurricanes &#160;

and sea &#160;

level rise, &#160;

heighten the 

threat we &#160;

face from &#160;

climate change. Additionally, &#160;

the impact &#160;

of climate &#160;

change in &#160;

the markets &#160;

that we &#160;

operate and &#160;

in other &#160;

global 

markets may &#160;

have the &#160;

effect of &#160;

increasing the &#160;

costs or &#160;

reducing the &#160;

availability of &#160;

insurance needed &#160;

for our &#160;

business operations. 

Climate change may also create transitional risks resulting from a shift to a low-carbon economy. &#160;

These transition risks may include 

changes in the legal and regulatory landscape, technology, consumer sentiment and preferences, and market demands that seek to 

mitigate the &#160;

effects &#160;

of climate &#160;

change. Changes &#160;

in the &#160;

legal &#160;

and regulatory &#160;

landscape may &#160;

additionally increase &#160;

our compliance 

costs. &#160;

These &#160;

climate-driven &#160;

changes &#160;

could &#160;

have &#160;

a &#160;

material &#160;

adverse &#160;

impact &#160;

on &#160;

asset &#160;

values &#160;

and &#160;

on &#160;

our &#160;

business &#160;

and &#160;

financial 

performance and those of our clients and customers. 

We &#160;

rely &#160;

on &#160;

other &#160;

companies &#160;

to &#160;

provide &#160;

key &#160;

components &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

business &#160;

infrastructure, &#160;

including &#160;

certain &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

core 

financial &#160;

transaction &#160;

processing &#160;

and &#160;

information &#160;

technology &#160;

and &#160;

security &#160;

services, &#160;

which &#160;

exposes &#160;

us &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

number &#160;

of 

operational risks that could have a material &#160;

adverse effect on us. 

Third parties provide key components of our business operations, such &#160;

as data processing, information security, recording 

and monitoring transactions, &#160;

online banking interfaces and &#160;

services, Internet connections and &#160;

network access. The most &#160;

important 

of these third-party &#160;

service providers for &#160;

us is Evertec. &#160;

Although the Evertec &#160;

Business Acquisition Transaction &#160;

narrowed the scope 

of &#160;

services &#160;

which &#160;

we &#160;

are &#160;

dependent &#160;

on &#160;

Evertec to &#160;

obtain &#160;

and &#160;

released &#160;

us &#160;

from &#160;

exclusivity &#160;

restrictions &#160;

that &#160;

limited &#160;

our &#160;

ability &#160;

to 

engage other third-party &#160;

providers of financial &#160;

technology services, we &#160;

are still dependent &#160;

on Evertec for &#160;

the provision of &#160;

essential 

services &#160;

to &#160;

our &#160;

business, &#160;

including &#160;

certain &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

core &#160;

financial &#160;

transaction &#160;

processing &#160;

and &#160;

information &#160;

technology &#160;

and &#160;

security 

services. As &#160;

a &#160;

result, we &#160;

are &#160;

particularly exposed &#160;

to &#160;

the operational &#160;

risks &#160;

of Evertec, &#160;

including those &#160;

relating to &#160;

a &#160;

breakdown or 

failure of Evertec&#8217;s systems or internal controls environment. Over the course of &#160;

our relationship with Evertec, we have experienced 

interruptions &#160;

and &#160;

delays &#160;

in &#160;

key &#160;

services &#160;

provided &#160;

by &#160;

Evertec, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

cyber &#160;

events, &#160;

as &#160;

a &#160;

result &#160;

of &#160;

system &#160;

breakdowns, 

misconfigurations, &#160;

human &#160;

error, &#160;

application &#160;

obsolescence &#160;

and &#160;

dependency &#160;

on &#160;

shared &#160;

infrastructure &#160;

components, &#160;

which &#160;

have &#160;

in 

certain cases &#160;

also &#160;

led to &#160;

exposure of &#160;

BPPR customer &#160;

information. Our &#160;

ability to &#160;

cure &#160;

legacy obsolescence &#160;

in the &#160;

hardware and 

software we &#160;

procure from &#160;

Evertec, as &#160;

well as &#160;

to effect &#160;

the segregation &#160;

of our &#160;

shared infrastructure, &#160;

is expected &#160;

to be &#160;

lengthy and 

complex, &#160;

which &#160;

exacerbates &#160;

our &#160;

exposure &#160;

to &#160;

resulting &#160;

operational, &#160;

including &#160;

cybersecurity, &#160;

risks. &#160;

See &#160;

&#8220;The &#160;

transition &#160;

to &#160;

new 

financial services &#160;

technology providers, &#160;

and the &#160;

replacement of &#160;

services currently &#160;

provided to &#160;

us &#160;

by Evertec, &#160;

will be &#160;

lengthy and 

complex&#8221; in the Operational Risks section of Item 1A &#160;

in this Form 10-K below. 

While we &#160;

select third-party &#160;

vendors carefully &#160;

and have &#160;

increased our &#160;

oversight of &#160;

these relationships, &#160;

we do &#160;

not control 

the &#160;

actions &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

vendors. &#160;

Any &#160;

problems &#160;

caused &#160;

by &#160;

these &#160;

vendors, &#160;

including &#160;

those &#160;

resulting &#160;

from &#160;

disruptions &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

services 

provided, vulnerabilities in or breaches &#160;

of the vendor&#8217;s systems, failure of &#160;

the vendor to handle &#160;

current or higher volumes, &#160;

failure of 

the vendor &#160;

to provide services &#160;

for any &#160;

reason or &#160;

poor performance of &#160;

services, or &#160;

failure of &#160;

the vendor to &#160;

notify us of &#160;

a reportable 

event in a timely manner, &#160;

could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to &#160;

our customers and otherwise conduct 

our &#160;

business, &#160;

result in &#160;

potential liability &#160;

to &#160;

clients &#160;

and customers, &#160;

result in &#160;

the &#160;

imposition of &#160;

fines, &#160;

penalties or &#160;

judgments by &#160;

our 

regulators, lead to &#160;

exposure of BPPR &#160;

customer information or &#160;

harm to our &#160;

reputation, any of &#160;

which could materially &#160;

and adversely 

affect us. &#160;

The inability &#160;

of our &#160;

third-party service &#160;

providers to &#160;

timely address &#160;

evolving cybersecurity threats &#160;

may further &#160;

exacerbate 

these risks. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also &#160;

hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with 

the vendor&#8217;s ability to serve us. Replacing these &#160;

third-party vendors, when possible, could also create significant &#160;

delay and expense. 

Accordingly, the use of third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to &#160;

our business operations. 

The transition to new financial services technology providers, and the replacement of services currently provided to &#160;

us by 

Evertec, will be lengthy and complex. 

Switching from &#160;

one vendor &#160;

of core &#160;

bank processing &#160;

and related &#160;

technology and &#160;

security services &#160;

to &#160;

one &#160;

or more &#160;

new 

vendors &#160;

is &#160;

a &#160;

complex &#160;

process &#160;

that &#160;

carries &#160;

business &#160;

and &#160;

financial &#160;

risks. &#160;

The &#160;

implementation &#160;

cycle &#160;

for &#160;

such &#160;

a &#160;

transition &#160;

can &#160;

be 

lengthy and require significant financial and &#160;

management resources from us. Such &#160;

a transition can also expose us, &#160;

and our clients, 

to &#160;

increased &#160;

costs &#160;

(including &#160;

conversion &#160;

costs), &#160;

business &#160;

disruption, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

operational &#160;

and &#160;

cybersecurity &#160;

risks. &#160;

Upon &#160;

the 

transition of all or &#160;

a portion of existing services &#160;

provided by Evertec to a &#160;

new financial services technology provider, &#160;

either (i) at the 

end of the term of the Second Amended and Restated &#160;

Master Services Agreement (the &#8220;MSA&#8221;) and related &#160;

agreements or (ii) earlier 

upon the &#160;

termination of any &#160;

service for &#160;

convenience under the &#160;

MSA, these transition &#160;

risks could result &#160;

in an &#160;

adverse effect &#160;

on our 

business, financial condition and results of operations. Although Evertec &#160;

has agreed to provide certain transition assistance to &#160;

us in 

connection with &#160;

the termination of &#160;

the MSA, &#160;

we are &#160;

ultimately dependent on &#160;

their ability &#160;

to provide &#160;

those services &#160;

in a &#160;

responsive 

and competent manner. Furthermore, we &#160;

may require transition assistance from Evertec beyond the term of &#160;

the MSA, delaying and 

lengthening any transition process away from Evertec &#160;

while increasing related costs. 

&#160;

Under the &#160;

MSA, we &#160;

are able &#160;

to terminate &#160;

services for &#160;

convenience with &#160;

180 days&#8217; &#160;

prior notice. &#160;

We expect &#160;

to exercise 

during the &#160;

term of &#160;

the MSA &#160;

the right &#160;

to terminate &#160;

certain services &#160;

for convenience &#160;

and to &#160;

transition such &#160;

services to &#160;

other service 

providers prior to the expiration &#160;

of the MSA, subject to &#160;

complying with the revenue minimums contemplated in &#160;

the MSA and certain 

other conditions. In &#160;

practice, in order &#160;

to switch &#160;

to a &#160;

new provider for &#160;

a particular service, &#160;

we will have &#160;

to commence procuring &#160;

and 

working on &#160;

a transition &#160;

process for &#160;

such service &#160;

significantly in &#160;

advance of &#160;

its termination &#160;

and, in &#160;

any case, &#160;

much earlier &#160;

than the 

automatic renewal notice date or the expiration date of &#160;

the MSA, and such process may extend beyond the current &#160;

term of the MSA. 

Furthermore, if &#160;

we &#160;

are &#160;

unsuccessful or &#160;

decide not &#160;

to &#160;

complete &#160;

the transition &#160;

after &#160;

expending significant &#160;

funds &#160;

and &#160;

management 

resources, it could also result in an adverse &#160;

effect on our business, financial condition and results &#160;

of operations. 

LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS 

Our &#160;

businesses &#160;

are &#160;

highly &#160;

regulated, &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

laws &#160;

and &#160;

regulations &#160;

that &#160;

apply &#160;

to &#160;

us &#160;

have &#160;

a &#160;

significant &#160;

impact &#160;

on &#160;

our 

business and operations. 

We are subject to extensive and evolving &#160;

regulation under U.S. federal, state and Puerto Rico laws that &#160;

govern almost all 

aspects of our operations and &#160;

limit the businesses in which &#160;

we may be engaged, &#160;

including regulation, supervision and examination 

by federal, state &#160;

and foreign banking &#160;

authorities. These laws &#160;

and regulations have &#160;

expanded significantly over an &#160;

extended period 

of &#160;

time &#160;

and &#160;

are &#160;

primarily &#160;

intended &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

protection &#160;

of &#160;

consumers, &#160;

borrowers &#160;

and &#160;

depositors. &#160;

Compliance &#160;

with &#160;

these &#160;

laws &#160;

and 

regulations has resulted, and will continue to &#160;

result, in significant costs. 

Additional &#160;

laws &#160;

and &#160;

regulations &#160;

may &#160;

be &#160;

enacted &#160;

or &#160;

adopted &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

future &#160;

that &#160;

could &#160;

significantly &#160;

affect &#160;

our &#160;

powers, 

authority &#160;

and &#160;

operations and &#160;

which could &#160;

have a &#160;

material adverse &#160;

effect &#160;

on &#160;

our &#160;

financial condition &#160;

and &#160;

results &#160;

of &#160;

operations. In 

particular, &#160;

we &#160;

could &#160;

be &#160;

adversely &#160;

impacted &#160;

by &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

laws &#160;

and &#160;

regulations, &#160;

or &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

application, &#160;

interpretation &#160;

or 

enforcement of &#160;

laws and &#160;

regulations, that proscribe &#160;

or institute more &#160;

stringent restrictions on &#160;

certain financial &#160;

services activities &#160;

or 

impose new &#160;

requirements relating to &#160;

the impact of &#160;

business activities on &#160;

ESG concerns, the &#160;

management of &#160;

risks associated with 

those concerns and &#160;

the offering of &#160;

products intended to achieve &#160;

ESG-related objectives. In &#160;

addition, new laws or &#160;

regulations could 

require &#160;

significant &#160;

system &#160;

and &#160;

process &#160;

changes &#160;

that &#160;

require &#160;

systems &#160;

upgrades &#160;

and &#160;

could &#160;

limit &#160;

our &#160;

ability &#160;

to &#160;

meet &#160;

adoption 

timeframes or pursue our &#160;

innovation roadmap. If we &#160;

do not appropriately comply &#160;

with current or future &#160;

laws or regulations, we &#160;

may 

be subject to &#160;

fines, penalties or &#160;

judgements, or to &#160;

material regulatory restrictions &#160;

on our &#160;

business, which could &#160;

also materially and 

adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

In 2023, the federal &#160;

banking regulators proposed revisions to the &#160;

U.S. capital rules and new &#160;

long-term debt requirements 

for banking organizations with $100 billion or more in &#160;

assets. &#160;

If finalized as proposed, the revisions to the capital &#160;

rules and the new 

long-term &#160;

debt &#160;

requirements &#160;

are &#160;

expected &#160;

to &#160;

generally &#160;

increase &#160;

capital &#160;

requirements &#160;

and &#160;

expenses, &#160;

including &#160;

interest &#160;

and 

noninterest expense, for large banking organizations. &#160;

In addition, during 2023, the federal banking regulators &#160;

indicated that they are 

considering revisions to liquidity requirements applicable to &#160;

banking organizations with $100 billion or &#160;

more in light of &#160;

the failures of 

three large banks in March and May 2023. &#160;

Any such revisions could require large banks to change the &#160;

size and composition of their 

liquidity portfolios, which could have adverse effects on &#160;

net interest income and net interest margin. &#160;

The &#160;

pending &#160;

and &#160;

anticipated &#160;

proposals &#160;

reflect &#160;

a &#160;

trend &#160;

of &#160;

increasingly &#160;

stringent &#160;

regulatory &#160;

requirements &#160;

for &#160;

banking 

organizations &#160;

with assets &#160;

of &#160;

$100 &#160;

billion &#160;

or &#160;

more, &#160;

relative &#160;

to &#160;

smaller &#160;

banking &#160;

organizations, as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

less differentiation &#160;

in &#160;

the 

requirements applicable among banking organizations with $100 billion or more in assets. &#160;

Although Popular currently has less than 

$100 &#160;

billion &#160;

in &#160;

assets, &#160;

actual, anticipated &#160;

or &#160;

potential changes &#160;

in &#160;

regulatory requirements &#160;

for &#160;

banking organizations &#160;

with at &#160;

least 

$100 billion in assets could &#160;

result in Popular deciding not to &#160;

pursue growth opportunities that would result &#160;

in its assets approaching 

or exceeding &#160;

that threshold, &#160;

or if &#160;

Popular&#8217;s assets &#160;

do exceed &#160;

that threshold, &#160;

a need &#160;

for Popular &#160;

to increase &#160;

its regulatory &#160;

capital, 

issue &#160;

substantial &#160;

amounts &#160;

of &#160;

long-term &#160;

debt &#160;

or &#160;

incur &#160;

other &#160;

significant &#160;

expenses &#160;

in &#160;

order &#160;

to &#160;

satisfy &#160;

applicable &#160;

regulatory 

requirements. 

Our participation &#160;

(or lack &#160;

of participation) &#160;

in certain &#160;

governmental programs, &#160;

such as &#160;

the Paycheck &#160;

Protection Program 

(&#8220;PPP&#8221;) enacted &#160;

in response &#160;

to the &#160;

COVID-19 pandemic, &#160;

also exposes &#160;

us to &#160;

increased legal &#160;

and regulatory &#160;

risks. We &#160;

have also 

been and could continue to &#160;

be exposed to adverse &#160;

action for the violation of &#160;

applicable legal requirements or the improper &#160;

conduct 

of our employees in connection with such loans. For example, on January 24, 2023, Popular Bank consented to the imposition of an 

order from &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve Board &#160;

requiring it &#160;

to &#160;

pay a &#160;

$2.3 million &#160;

civil money &#160;

penalty to &#160;

settle certain &#160;

findings arising &#160;

from 

Popular Bank&#8217;s approval of six Payment Protection Program &#160;

loans. &#160;

We &#160;

are from &#160;

time to &#160;

time subject &#160;

to information &#160;

requests, investigations &#160;

and other &#160;

regulatory enforcement &#160;

proceedings 

from departments and agencies of the U.S. and Puerto Rico &#160;

governments, including those that investigate compliance &#160;

with 

U.S. sanctions and consumer protection laws and regulations, which may &#160;

expose us to significant penalties and collateral 

consequences, and could result in higher compliance &#160;

costs or restrictions on our operations. 

We &#160;

from &#160;

time-to-time &#160;

self-report &#160;

compliance &#160;

matters &#160;

to, &#160;

or &#160;

receive &#160;

requests &#160;

for &#160;

information &#160;

from, &#160;

departments &#160;

and 

agencies &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

and &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

governments, &#160;

including &#160;

with &#160;

respect &#160;

to &#160;

compliance &#160;

with &#160;

consumer &#160;

protection &#160;

laws &#160;

and 

regulations. &#160;

For &#160;

example, &#160;

BPPR &#160;

has &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

past &#160;

received &#160;

requests &#160;

for &#160;

information, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

subpoenas &#160;

and &#160;

civil &#160;

investigative 

demands &#160;

from &#160;

U.S. &#160;

government &#160;

regulators, &#160;

including &#160;

concerning &#160;

add-ons &#160;

on &#160;

consumer &#160;

products, &#160;

real &#160;

estate &#160;

appraisals &#160;

and 

residential and &#160;

construction loans &#160;

in Puerto &#160;

Rico. BPPR &#160;

has also &#160;

self-identified and &#160;

reported to &#160;

applicable regulators &#160;

compliance 

matters related to U.S. sanctions, as well as mortgage, &#160;

credit reporting and other consumer lending practices. &#160;

Incidents of this nature and investigations or examinations by governmental authorities have resulted in the past, and may 

in the &#160;

future result, in &#160;

judgments, settlements, fines, &#160;

enforcement actions, penalties &#160;

or other sanctions &#160;

adverse to the &#160;

Corporation, 

which could materially and adversely affect the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause &#160;

serious 

reputational &#160;

harm. &#160;

Any &#160;

such &#160;

settlements &#160;

or &#160;

orders &#160;

that &#160;

we &#160;

enter &#160;

into, &#160;

or &#160;

that &#160;

regulatory &#160;

authorities &#160;

impose &#160;

on &#160;

us &#160;

could &#160;

require 

enhancements &#160;

to &#160;

our &#160;

procedures &#160;

and &#160;

controls &#160;

and &#160;

entail &#160;

significant &#160;

operational &#160;

and &#160;

compliance &#160;

costs. &#160;

Furthermore, &#160;

issues &#160;

or 

delays in &#160;

satisfying the &#160;

requirements of &#160;

a regulatory &#160;

settlement or &#160;

action on &#160;

a timely &#160;

basis could &#160;

result in &#160;

additional penalties &#160;

and 

enforcement actions, which could be significant. In connection with the resolution of regulatory proceedings, enforcement authorities 

may seek admissions of wrongdoing and, in some cases, criminal pleas, which &#160;

could lead to increased exposure to private litigation, 

loss of clients or customers, and restrictions on offering certain products or &#160;

services. In addition, responding to information-gathering 

requests, &#160;

investigations &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

regulatory &#160;

proceedings, &#160;

regardless &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

ultimate &#160;

outcome &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

matter, &#160;

could &#160;

be &#160;

time-

consuming, expensive and divert management attention &#160;

from our business. &#160;

Financial services &#160;

institutions such &#160;

as Popular &#160;

have been &#160;

subject to &#160;

heightened expectations &#160;

and regulatory &#160;

scrutiny in 

recent years. &#160;

Our regulators&#8217; &#160;

oversight is &#160;

not limited &#160;

to banking &#160;

and financial &#160;

services laws &#160;

but extends &#160;

to other &#160;

significant laws 

such as those related to anti &#160;

money laundering, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Further, &#160;

regulators in the performance of their 

supervisory and enforcement &#160;

duties, have significant &#160;

discretion and power &#160;

to prevent or &#160;

remedy what they &#160;

deem to be &#160;

unsafe and 

unsound &#160;

practices &#160;

or &#160;

violations &#160;

of &#160;

laws &#160;

by &#160;

banks &#160;

and &#160;

bank &#160;

holding &#160;

companies. &#160;

Therefore, &#160;

the &#160;

outcome &#160;

of &#160;

any &#160;

investigative &#160;

or 

enforcement action, which may take years and be &#160;

material to Popular, may be difficult to predict or estimate. &#160;

Complying with economic and trade sanctions programs &#160;

and anti-money laundering laws and regulations &#160;

can increase our 

operational &#160;

and &#160;

compliance &#160;

costs &#160;

and &#160;

risks. &#160;

If &#160;

we, &#160;

and &#160;

our &#160;

subsidiaries, &#160;

affiliates &#160;

or &#160;

third-party &#160;

service &#160;

providers, &#160;

are 

found to &#160;

have failed &#160;

to comply &#160;

with applicable &#160;

economic and &#160;

trade sanctions &#160;

programs and &#160;

anti-money laundering &#160;

laws 

and &#160;

regulations, &#160;

we &#160;

could &#160;

be &#160;

exposed &#160;

to &#160;

fines, &#160;

sanctions &#160;

and &#160;

penalties, &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

regulatory &#160;

actions, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as 

governmental investigations. &#160;

As &#160;

a &#160;

federally &#160;

regulated &#160;

financial &#160;

institution, &#160;

we &#160;

must &#160;

comply &#160;

with &#160;

regulations &#160;

and &#160;

economic &#160;

and &#160;

trade &#160;

sanctions &#160;

and 

embargo &#160;

programs &#160;

administered by &#160;

the &#160;

Office &#160;

of &#160;

Foreign &#160;

Assets &#160;

Control &#160;

(&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Treasury, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

anti-money 

laundering laws and regulations, including those under &#160;

the Bank Secrecy Act. 

Economic and trade sanctions regulations and programs administered by OFAC prohibit U.S.-based entities from entering 

into or facilitating &#160;

unlicensed transactions with, for &#160;

the benefit of, &#160;

or in some &#160;

cases involving the &#160;

property and property interests &#160;

of, 

persons, &#160;

governments or &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

government under &#160;

one &#160;

or &#160;

more &#160;

sanctions &#160;

regimes, &#160;

and &#160;

also &#160;

prohibit 

transactions &#160;

that &#160;

provide &#160;

a &#160;

more &#160;

sanctions &#160;

regimes. &#160;

We &#160;

are &#160;

also 

subject to &#160;

a variety &#160;

of reporting &#160;

and other &#160;

requirements under &#160;

the Bank &#160;

Secrecy Act, &#160;

including the &#160;

requirement to &#160;

file suspicious 

activity and currency &#160;

transaction reports, that &#160;

are designed to &#160;

assist in &#160;

the detection &#160;

and prevention of &#160;

money laundering, terrorist 

financing &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

criminal &#160;

activities. &#160;

In &#160;

addition, &#160;

as &#160;

a &#160;

financial &#160;

institution &#160;

we &#160;

are &#160;

required &#160;

to, &#160;

among &#160;

other &#160;

things, &#160;

identify &#160;

our 

customers, adopt formal &#160;

and comprehensive anti-money &#160;

laundering programs, scrutinize &#160;

or altogether prohibit &#160;

certain transactions 

of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S. &#160;

law enforcement agencies concerning our customers and &#160;

their 

transactions. Failure &#160;

by the &#160;

Corporation, its &#160;

subsidiaries, affiliates &#160;

or &#160;

third-party service &#160;

providers to &#160;

comply with &#160;

these &#160;

laws &#160;

and 

regulations &#160;

could &#160;

have &#160;

serious &#160;

legal &#160;

and &#160;

reputational &#160;

consequences &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation, &#160;

including &#160;

the &#160;

possibility &#160;

of &#160;

regulatory 

enforcement &#160;

or &#160;

other &#160;

legal &#160;

action, &#160;

including &#160;

significant &#160;

civil &#160;

and &#160;

criminal &#160;

penalties. &#160;

We &#160;

also &#160;

incur &#160;

higher &#160;

costs &#160;

and &#160;

face &#160;

greater 

compliance risks in &#160;

structuring and operating &#160;

our businesses to comply &#160;

with these requirements. The &#160;

markets in which &#160;

we operate 

heighten these costs and risks. 

We have established risk-based policies and procedures and employed software designed to &#160;

assist us and our personnel 

in complying &#160;

with these &#160;

applicable laws &#160;

and regulations. &#160;

Even if &#160;

the appropriate &#160;

controls are &#160;

in place, &#160;

there can &#160;

be no &#160;

assurance 

that &#160;

our &#160;

policies &#160;

and &#160;

procedures will &#160;

prevent &#160;

us &#160;

from &#160;

blocking &#160;

and &#160;

rejecting &#160;

all &#160;

applicable &#160;

transactions &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

customers &#160;

or &#160;

our 

customers&#8217; customers &#160;

that may &#160;

involve a &#160;

sanctioned person, &#160;

government or &#160;

country. &#160;

Any failure &#160;

to detect &#160;

and prevent &#160;

any such 

transaction &#160;

could &#160;

result &#160;

in &#160;

a &#160;

violation &#160;

of &#160;

applicable &#160;

laws &#160;

and &#160;

regulations &#160;

and &#160;

adversely &#160;

affect &#160;

our &#160;

reputation, &#160;

business, &#160;

financial 

condition and results of operations. 

From time &#160;

to time &#160;

we have &#160;

identified and &#160;

voluntarily self-disclosed &#160;

to OFAC &#160;

transactions that &#160;

were not &#160;

timely identified, 

blocked &#160;

or &#160;

rejected &#160;

by &#160;

our &#160;

policies, &#160;

controls &#160;

and &#160;

procedures &#160;

for &#160;

screening &#160;

transactions &#160;

that &#160;

might &#160;

violate &#160;

the &#160;

regulations &#160;

and 

economic and &#160;

trade sanctions &#160;

programs administered &#160;

by OFAC. &#160;

For example, &#160;

during the &#160;

second quarter &#160;

of 2022, &#160;

BPPR entered 

into &#160;

a &#160;

settlement &#160;

agreement &#160;

with &#160;

OFAC &#160;

with &#160;

respect &#160;

to &#160;

certain &#160;

transactions &#160;

processed &#160;

on &#160;

behalf &#160;

of &#160;

two &#160;

employees &#160;

of &#160;

the 

Government &#160;

of &#160;

Venezuela, &#160;

in &#160;

apparent &#160;

violation &#160;

of &#160;

U.S. &#160;

sanctions &#160;

against &#160;

Venezuela. &#160;

Popular &#160;

agreed &#160;

to &#160;

pay &#160;

approximately 

$256,000 to settle the &#160;

apparent violations, which had been &#160;

self-disclosed to OFAC. &#160;

There can be no &#160;

assurances that any failure &#160;

to 

comply with &#160;

U.S. sanctions &#160;

and embargoes, &#160;

or &#160;

with anti-money &#160;

laundering laws &#160;

and &#160;

regulations, will &#160;

not result &#160;

in material &#160;

fines, 

sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us. 

Furthermore, if &#160;

the policies, &#160;

controls, and &#160;

procedures of &#160;

one of &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

third-party service &#160;

providers, together 

with our &#160;

third-party oversight &#160;

of such &#160;

providers, do &#160;

not prevent &#160;

it from &#160;

violating applicable &#160;

laws and &#160;

regulations in &#160;

transactions in 

which it engages, such violations could adversely affect its &#160;

ability to provide services to us. &#160;

We are &#160;

subject to &#160;

regulatory capital &#160;

adequacy requirements, and &#160;

if we &#160;

fail to &#160;

meet these &#160;

requirements our &#160;

business and 

financial condition will be adversely affected. 

Under regulatory capital adequacy requirements, and other &#160;

regulatory requirements, Popular and our banking &#160;

subsidiaries 

must &#160;

meet &#160;

requirements &#160;

that &#160;

include &#160;

quantitative &#160;

measures &#160;

of &#160;

assets, &#160;

liabilities &#160;

and &#160;

certain &#160;

off-balance &#160;

sheet &#160;

items, &#160;

subject &#160;

to 

qualitative &#160;

judgments &#160;

by &#160;

regulators &#160;

regarding &#160;

components, &#160;

risk &#160;

weightings &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

factors. &#160;

If &#160;

we &#160;

fail &#160;

to &#160;

meet &#160;

these &#160;

minimum 

capital &#160;

requirements &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

regulatory &#160;

requirements, &#160;

our &#160;

business &#160;

and &#160;

financial &#160;

condition &#160;

will &#160;

be &#160;

materially &#160;

and &#160;

adversely 

affected. If &#160;

a financial &#160;

holding company &#160;

fails to &#160;

maintain well-capitalized &#160;

status under &#160;

the regulatory &#160;

framework, or &#160;

is deemed &#160;

not 

well managed &#160;

under regulatory &#160;

exam procedures, or &#160;

if it &#160;

experiences certain &#160;

regulatory violations, its &#160;

status as &#160;

a financial &#160;

holding 

company and its &#160;

related eligibility for &#160;

a streamlined review &#160;

process for acquisition &#160;

proposals, and its &#160;

ability to offer &#160;

certain financial 

products, may be &#160;

compromised and its &#160;

financial condition and &#160;

results of operations &#160;

could be adversely &#160;

affected. The failure &#160;

of any 

depository &#160;

institution &#160;

subsidiary &#160;

of &#160;

a &#160;

financial &#160;

holding &#160;

company &#160;

to &#160;

maintain &#160;

well-capitalized &#160;

or &#160;

well-managed &#160;

status &#160;

could &#160;

have 

similar consequences. &#160;

In &#160;

addition, federal &#160;

regulators &#160;

have proposed &#160;

revisions to &#160;

increase capital &#160;

requirements for &#160;

banking organizations &#160;

with 

$100 billion or more in assets. If adopted, such standards may in the future affect us. See &#8220;Our businesses are highly regulated, and 

the laws &#160;

and regulations &#160;

that apply &#160;

to us &#160;

have a &#160;

significant impact &#160;

on our &#160;

business and &#160;

operations&#8221; in &#160;

the Legal &#160;

and Regulatory 

Risks section of Item 1A in this Form 10-K. 

Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may &#160;

have a material adverse effect on our earnings. 

Substantially &#160;

all &#160;

the &#160;

deposits &#160;

of &#160;

BPPR &#160;

and &#160;

PB &#160;

are &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

insurance &#160;

up &#160;

to &#160;

applicable &#160;

limits &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

FDIC&#8217;s &#160;

deposit 

insurance fund &#160;

(&#8220;DIF&#8221;) and, as &#160;

a result, BPPR &#160;

and PB &#160;

are subject to &#160;

FDIC deposit &#160;

insurance assessments. On &#160;

October 18, 2022, 

the FDIC &#160;

finalized a &#160;

rule that &#160;

increased initial &#160;

base deposit &#160;

insurance assessment &#160;

rates by &#160;

2 basis &#160;

points, beginning &#160;

with the &#160;

first 

quarterly assessment period of 2023. In addition, in November 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule that imposes a special assessment to 

recover the costs to the DIF resulting from the FDIC&#8217;s &#160;

use, in March 2023, of the systemic risk exception to &#160;

the least-cost resolution 

test &#160;

under &#160;

the &#160;

FDIA &#160;

in &#160;

connection &#160;

with &#160;

the &#160;

receiverships &#160;

of &#160;

Silicon &#160;

Valley &#160;

Bank &#160;

and &#160;

Signature &#160;

Bank. &#160;

The &#160;

exact &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

this 

assessment will be determined when the FDIC terminates &#160;

the related receiverships considered in the final &#160;

rule. Accordingly, the final 

special assessment &#160;

amount and collection &#160;

period may change &#160;

as the &#160;

estimated cost &#160;

is periodically adjusted &#160;

or if &#160;

the total &#160;

amount 

collected varies. 

We &#160;

are generally &#160;

unable to &#160;

control the &#160;

amount of &#160;

premiums or &#160;

additional assessments &#160;

that we &#160;

are required &#160;

to pay &#160;

for 

FDIC insurance. If there &#160;

are additional bank or financial &#160;

institution failures, our level of &#160;

non-performing assets increases, or our &#160;

risk 

profile changes &#160;

or our &#160;

capital position &#160;

is impaired, &#160;

we may &#160;

be required &#160;

to pay &#160;

even higher &#160;

FDIC premiums. &#160;

Any future &#160;

additional 

increases in &#160;

FDIC premiums, &#160;

assessment rates &#160;

or special &#160;

assessments may &#160;

materially adversely &#160;

affect our &#160;

results of &#160;

operations.

LIQUIDITY RISKS 

We &#160;

are subject &#160;

to liquidity &#160;

risks arising &#160;

from market &#160;

events or &#160;

disruptions and &#160;

instances of &#160;

low &#160;

investor and &#160;

depositor 

confidence. Furthermore, actions by the rating agencies &#160;

or decreases in our capital levels may have adverse &#160;

effects on our 

liquidity and business, including by raising the &#160;

cost of our obligations or affecting our ability &#160;

to borrow. &#160;

We must &#160;

maintain adequate liquidity &#160;

and funding sources &#160;

to support &#160;

our operations, fund &#160;

customer deposit withdrawals, 

repay &#160;

borrowings &#160;

and &#160;

debt, &#160;

comply &#160;

with &#160;

our &#160;

financial &#160;

obligations, &#160;

fund &#160;

planned &#160;

capital &#160;

distributions &#160;

and &#160;

meet &#160;

regulatory 

requirements. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

most &#160;

significant &#160;

source &#160;

of &#160;

funds &#160;

are &#160;

bank &#160;

deposits, &#160;

including &#160;

customer &#160;

deposits &#160;

and &#160;

brokered 

deposits. &#160;

In &#160;

addition &#160;

to &#160;

deposits, &#160;

sources &#160;

of &#160;

liquidity &#160;

include &#160;

secured &#160;

borrowing &#160;

arrangements, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

those &#160;

with &#160;

the &#160;

Federal 

Reserve Bank of &#160;

New York &#160;

and the Federal &#160;

Home Loan Bank &#160;

of New York &#160;

(&#8220;FHLBNY&#8221;), unpledged securities from &#160;

our investment 

portfolio, the capital markets and proceeds from loan &#160;

sales or securitizations. &#160;

Popular&#8217;s &#160;

liquidity &#160;

and &#160;

ability &#160;

to &#160;

fund &#160;

and &#160;

operate &#160;

its &#160;

business &#160;

could &#160;

be &#160;

materially &#160;

adversely &#160;

affected &#160;

by &#160;

a &#160;

variety &#160;

of 

conditions and &#160;

factors, some &#160;

of which &#160;

are out &#160;

of Popular&#8217;s control. &#160;

For example, &#160;

market events &#160;

or disruptions, &#160;

such as &#160;

periods of 

market stress and &#160;

low investor confidence in &#160;

financial institutions could result &#160;

in deposit withdrawals, &#160;

especially to the &#160;

extent those 

deposits are in excess of the FDIC-insured limit of $250,000. &#160;

As of December 31, 2023, we had $14.6 billion of deposits (other than 

collateralized &#160;

public &#160;

funds, &#160;

which &#160;

represent &#160;

public &#160;

deposit &#160;

balances &#160;

from &#160;

governmental &#160;

entities &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

and &#160;

its &#160;

territories, 

including Puerto Rico &#160;

and the &#160;

United States Virgin &#160;

Islands, that are &#160;

collateralized based on &#160;

such jurisdictions&#8217; &#160;

applicable collateral 

requirements) in excess of &#160;

the FDIC-insured limit. We &#160;

may also suffer outflows &#160;

of customer deposits due &#160;

to competition from &#160;

other 

banks or &#160;

alternative investments. &#160;

In addition, in &#160;

periods of stress, &#160;

we may &#160;

not be able &#160;

to access existing &#160;

funding sources, access 

the capital markets or to sell or securitize loans or &#160;

other assets, or to access such sources or to &#160;

sell or securitize assets on favorable 

terms. 

In addition, actions &#160;

by the rating agencies &#160;

could raise the cost &#160;

of our borrowings, since &#160;

lower rated securities are &#160;

usually 

required by the &#160;

market to pay &#160;

higher rates than &#160;

obligations of higher credit &#160;

quality. Our &#160;

credit ratings were &#160;

reduced substantially in 

2009 and, although one of &#160;

the three major rating agencies upgraded our &#160;

senior unsecured rating back to &#160;

&#8220;investment grade&#8221; during 

2021, &#160;

the &#160;

remaining &#160;

two &#160;

rating &#160;

agencies &#160;

have &#160;

not &#160;

upgraded &#160;

their &#160;

current &#160;

&#8220;non-investment &#160;

grade&#8221; &#160;

rating. &#160;

The &#160;

market &#160;

for &#160;

non-

investment &#160;

grade securities &#160;

is &#160;

much &#160;

smaller &#160;

and &#160;

less &#160;

liquid than &#160;

for investment &#160;

grade securities. &#160;

If &#160;

we &#160;

were to &#160;

attempt &#160;

to &#160;

issue 

preferred stock &#160;

or debt &#160;

securities into &#160;

the capital &#160;

markets, it &#160;

is possible &#160;

that there &#160;

would not &#160;

be sufficient &#160;

demand to &#160;

complete a 

transaction or &#160;

that the &#160;

cost could &#160;

be substantially &#160;

higher than &#160;

for more &#160;

highly rated &#160;

securities. If &#160;

Popular is &#160;

unable to &#160;

access the 

capital markets on favorable terms, our liquidity &#160;

may be adversely affected. 

Changes in our ratings and capital levels could affect our &#160;

relationships with some creditors and limit our &#160;

access to funding. 

For example, &#160;

having negative &#160;

tangible capital &#160;

may impact &#160;

our ability &#160;

to &#160;

access some &#160;

sources of &#160;

wholesale funding. &#160;

The Federal 

Housing Finance &#160;

Agency restricts the &#160;

FHLBNY from &#160;

lending to &#160;

members of &#160;

the FHLBNY &#160;

with negative &#160;

tangible capital &#160;

unless the 

member&#8217;s primary banking regulator makes a written request to the &#160;

FHLBNY to maintain access to borrowings. Both BPPR &#160;

and PB 

have secured borrowing facilities with the FHLBNY &#160;

and had outstanding exposures of $2.5 billion and &#160;

$1.7 billion respectively as of 

December 31, 2023. Losing &#160;

access to the FHLBNY &#160;

borrowing facilities could adversely impact &#160;

liquidity at the banking &#160;

subsidiaries. 

Additionally, if &#160;

BPPR or PB &#160;

cease to be &#160;

well-capitalized, the FDIA and &#160;

regulations adopted thereunder would &#160;

restrict their ability &#160;

to 

accept brokered deposits and limit the rate of &#160;

interest payable on deposits. 

Our banking &#160;

subsidiaries also &#160;

have recourse &#160;

obligations under certain &#160;

agreements with &#160;

third parties, &#160;

including servicing 

and custodial agreements, that include ratings covenants. Upon failure to maintain the required credit ratings, &#160;

the third parties could 

have &#160;

the &#160;

right &#160;

to &#160;

require &#160;

us &#160;

to &#160;

engage &#160;

a &#160;

substitute &#160;

fund &#160;

custodian &#160;

and &#160;

increase &#160;

collateral &#160;

levels &#160;

securing &#160;

recourse &#160;

obligations. 

Collateral &#160;

pledged by &#160;

us &#160;

to &#160;

secure &#160;

recourse &#160;

obligations approximated &#160;

$27.1 million &#160;

on &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2023. &#160;

While management 

expects that we would be able to meet any additional &#160;

collateral requirements if and when needed, the requirements &#160;

to post collateral 

under certain agreements or the loss of custodian &#160;

funds could reduce our liquidity resources and &#160;

impact our results of operations. &#160;

As a holding company, we depend on dividends and distributions from our &#160;

subsidiaries for liquidity. 

As a bank holding company, &#160;

we depend primarily on dividends from &#160;

our banking and other operating subsidiaries &#160;

to fund 

our cash needs, including to capitalize our subsidiaries. Our banking subsidiaries, BPPR and PB, are limited by law in their ability to 

make dividend &#160;

payments and other &#160;

distributions to &#160;

us based &#160;

on their earnings, &#160;

dividend history, &#160;

and capital &#160;

position. Based on &#160;

its 

current financial condition, &#160;

PB may &#160;

not declare or &#160;

pay a &#160;

dividend without the &#160;

prior approval of &#160;

the Federal Reserve &#160;

Board and &#160;

the 

NYSDFS. A &#160;

failure by &#160;

our banking subsidiaries &#160;

to generate &#160;

sufficient income &#160;

and free &#160;

cash flow to &#160;

make dividend &#160;

payments to &#160;

us 

may &#160;

affect &#160;

our &#160;

ability to &#160;

fund &#160;

our cash &#160;

needs, which &#160;

could have &#160;

a negative &#160;

impact on &#160;

our financial &#160;

condition, liquidity, &#160;

results &#160;

of 

operation or capital position. Such failure could also affect &#160;

our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and to &#160;

repurchase shares 

of our common stock. We have in the past suspended dividend payments &#160;

on our common stock and preferred stock during times of 

economic uncertainty, &#160;

and there &#160;

can be &#160;

no assurance &#160;

that we &#160;

will be &#160;

able to &#160;

continue to &#160;

declare dividends to &#160;

our stockholders &#160;

in 

any future periods. &#160;

An &#160;

impact &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

tangible &#160;

capital &#160;

levels &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

operating &#160;

subsidiaries, &#160;

could &#160;

also &#160;

limit &#160;

the &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

capital &#160;

we &#160;

may 

upstream to the holding company. Tangible &#160;

capital levels have in the past been, and may in the &#160;

future be, adversely affected by the 

impact of &#160;

rapidly rising interest &#160;

rates on investment &#160;

securities in our &#160;

available-for-sale portfolio. For &#160;

a discussion of &#160;

risks related to 

changes in interest &#160;

rates, see &#8220;Changes &#160;

in interest rates &#160;

and credit spreads &#160;

can adversely impact &#160;

our financial condition, &#160;

including 

our investment portfolio, since a significant portion of &#160;

our business involves borrowing and lending money, &#160;

and investing in financial 

instruments&#8221; in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 

We also depend &#160;

on dividends from our &#160;

banking and other operating subsidiaries &#160;

to pay debt service &#160;

on outstanding debt 

and to repay maturing debt. Our ability to &#160;

declare such dividends would be subject to regulatory requirements and could &#160;

require the 

prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. 

STRATEGIC RISKS 

Potential acquisitions of businesses or &#160;

loan portfolios could increase some &#160;

of the risks that &#160;

we face, and may &#160;

be delayed 

or prohibited due to regulatory constraints. 

To &#160;

the extent &#160;

permitted by &#160;

our applicable &#160;

regulators, we &#160;

may pursue &#160;

strategic acquisition &#160;

opportunities. Acquiring &#160;

other 

businesses, however, involves various risks, &#160;

including potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the &#160;

target company, 

exposure &#160;

to &#160;

potential &#160;

asset &#160;

quality &#160;

issues &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

target &#160;

company, &#160;

potential &#160;

disruption &#160;

to &#160;

our &#160;

business, &#160;

the &#160;

possible &#160;

loss &#160;

of &#160;

key 

employees and customers of &#160;

the target company, &#160;

and difficulty in &#160;

estimating the value of &#160;

the target company. &#160;

If we pay &#160;

a premium 

over book or &#160;

market value in &#160;

connection with an &#160;

acquisition, some dilution of &#160;

our tangible book &#160;

value and net &#160;

income per common 

share &#160;

may &#160;

occur &#160;

in &#160;

connection with &#160;

any &#160;

future &#160;

transaction. Furthermore, &#160;

failure &#160;

to &#160;

realize the &#160;

expected &#160;

revenue increases, &#160;

cost 

savings, increases in geographic or product presence, or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse 

effect on our business, financial condition and results of &#160;

operations. 

Similarly, &#160;

acquiring &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolios &#160;

involves &#160;

various &#160;

risks. &#160;

When &#160;

acquiring &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolios, &#160;

management &#160;

makes 

assumptions and &#160;

judgments about &#160;

the collectability &#160;

of the &#160;

loans, including &#160;

the creditworthiness &#160;

of borrowers &#160;

and the &#160;

value of &#160;

the 

real &#160;

estate and &#160;

other assets &#160;

serving &#160;

as collateral &#160;

for the &#160;

repayment of &#160;

secured loans. &#160;

In &#160;

estimating the &#160;

extent of &#160;

the losses, &#160;

we 

analyze &#160;

the &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolio &#160;

based &#160;

on &#160;

historical &#160;

loss &#160;

experience, &#160;

volume &#160;

and &#160;

classification &#160;

of &#160;

loans, &#160;

volume &#160;

and &#160;

trends &#160;

in 

delinquencies &#160;

and &#160;

nonaccruals, &#160;

local &#160;

economic &#160;

conditions, &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

pertinent &#160;

information. &#160;

If &#160;

our &#160;

assumptions &#160;

are &#160;

incorrect, 

however, &#160;

our actual &#160;

losses could &#160;

be higher &#160;

than estimated &#160;

and increased &#160;

loss reserves &#160;

may be &#160;

required, which &#160;

would negatively 

affect our results of operations. 

Finally, certain &#160;

acquisitions by financial institutions, &#160;

including us, are &#160;

subject to approval &#160;

by a variety &#160;

of federal and &#160;

state 

regulatory agencies. &#160;

Regulatory approvals &#160;

could be &#160;

delayed, impeded, &#160;

restrictively conditioned &#160;

or denied. &#160;

We may &#160;

fail to &#160;

pursue, 

evaluate &#160;

or &#160;

complete &#160;

strategic &#160;

and &#160;

competitively &#160;

significant &#160;

acquisition &#160;

opportunities &#160;

as &#160;

a &#160;

result &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

inability, &#160;

or &#160;

perceived &#160;

or 

anticipated inability, &#160;

to obtain regulatory &#160;

approvals in a &#160;

timely manner, &#160;

under reasonable conditions or &#160;

at all. Difficulties &#160;

associated 

with &#160;

potential &#160;

acquisitions &#160;

that &#160;

may &#160;

result &#160;

from &#160;

these &#160;

factors &#160;

could &#160;

have &#160;

a &#160;

material &#160;

adverse &#160;

effect &#160;

on &#160;

our &#160;

business, &#160;

financial 

condition and results of operations. 

We &#160;

have &#160;

embarked &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

broad-based &#160;

multi-year, &#160;

technological &#160;

and &#160;

business &#160;

process &#160;

transformation. &#160;

The &#160;

failure &#160;

to 

achieve &#160;

the &#160;

goals &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

transformation &#160;

project, &#160;

the &#160;

inability &#160;

to &#160;

maintain &#160;

project &#160;

expenses &#160;

within &#160;

current &#160;

estimates &#160;

or 

delays in &#160;

executing our plans &#160;

to implement the &#160;

transformation project, may &#160;

materially and adversely &#160;

affect our business, 

financial condition, results of operations, or &#160;

cause reputational harm. 

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

has &#160;

embarked &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

broad-based &#160;

multi-year, &#160;

technological &#160;

and &#160;

business &#160;

process &#160;

transformation. &#160;

Our 

technology and &#160;

business transformation &#160;

will be &#160;

a significant &#160;

priority for &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

over the &#160;

next two &#160;

years and &#160;

beyond. We 

expect the &#160;

expenses tied &#160;

to this &#160;

transformation project, &#160;

which will &#160;

continue through &#160;

at least &#160;

2025, to &#160;

result in &#160;

an enhanced &#160;

digital 

experience for our clients, as well as better technology &#160;

and more efficient processes for our employees. &#160;

To &#160;

execute the &#160;

transformation project, &#160;

we plan &#160;

to expand &#160;

our digital &#160;

capabilities, modernize &#160;

our technology &#160;

foundation, 

and &#160;

implement &#160;

agile &#160;

and &#160;

efficient &#160;

business &#160;

processes &#160;

across &#160;

the &#160;

entire &#160;

company. &#160;

We &#160;

may &#160;

not &#160;

succeed &#160;

in &#160;

executing &#160;

the 

transformation project, may fail &#160;

to properly estimate cost &#160;

of the same, or &#160;

may experience delays in &#160;

executing our plans, which &#160;

may 

in turn &#160;

cause the &#160;

Corporation to &#160;

incur costs &#160;

exceeding our &#160;

current estimates &#160;

or disrupt &#160;

our operations, &#160;

including our &#160;

technological 

services to our customers, or fall short &#160;

of our projected earnings targets driven by these &#160;

efforts. To &#160;

the extent that these disruptions 

persist over time and/or recur, this could negatively impact our competitive &#160;

position, require additional expenditures, and/or harm &#160;

our 

relationships &#160;

with &#160;

our &#160;

customers &#160;

and &#160;

thus &#160;

may &#160;

materially &#160;

and &#160;

adversely &#160;

affect &#160;

our &#160;

business, &#160;

financial &#160;

condition, &#160;

results &#160;

of 

operations, or cause reputational harm. 

We face significant and increasing competition in the &#160;

rapidly evolving financial services industry. 

&#160;

We &#160;

operate &#160;

in &#160;

a &#160;

highly competitive &#160;

environment, in &#160;

which we &#160;

compete &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

basis &#160;

of &#160;

a &#160;

number of &#160;

factors, 

including &#160;

customer &#160;

service, &#160;

quality &#160;

and &#160;

variety &#160;

of &#160;

products &#160;

and &#160;

services, &#160;

price, &#160;

interest &#160;

rates &#160;

on &#160;

loans &#160;

and &#160;

deposits, innovation, 

technology, &#160;

ease of &#160;

use, reputation, &#160;

and transaction &#160;

execution. While &#160;

our main &#160;

competition continues &#160;

to come &#160;

from other &#160;

Puerto 

Rico banks and financial institutions, we face increased competition from non-Puerto Rico institutions as emerging technologies and 

the growth &#160;

of e-commerce &#160;

have significantly &#160;

reduced geographic &#160;

barriers. &#160;

These technologies &#160;

have also &#160;

made it &#160;

easier for &#160;

non-

depositary institutions &#160;

to offer &#160;

products and &#160;

services that &#160;

traditionally were &#160;

banking products &#160;

and allowed &#160;

non-traditional financial 

service &#160;

providers and &#160;

technology companies &#160;

to &#160;

provide electronic &#160;

and &#160;

internet-based financial &#160;

solutions &#160;

and services. &#160;

Increased 

competition could create pressure to lower prices, fees, commissions or &#160;

credit standards on our products and services, which could 

adversely affect our &#160;

financial condition and results &#160;

of operations. Increased competition could &#160;

also create pressure to &#160;

raise interest 

rates on deposits, which could also impact our &#160;

financial condition and results of operations. 

If we are unable to &#160;

meet constant technological changes and react quickly to &#160;

meet new industry standards, including as a 

result &#160;

of our &#160;

continued dependence &#160;

on &#160;

Evertec, we &#160;

may &#160;

be unable &#160;

to &#160;

enhance our &#160;

current services &#160;

and introduce &#160;

new 

products and &#160;

services in &#160;

a timely &#160;

and cost-effective &#160;

manner, &#160;

placing us &#160;

at a &#160;

competitive disadvantage &#160;

and significantly 

affecting our business, financial condition and &#160;

results of operations. 

To compete effectively, &#160;

we need to constantly enhance and modify our products and services and introduce new products 

and &#160;

services &#160;

to &#160;

attract &#160;

and &#160;

retain &#160;

clients &#160;

or &#160;

to &#160;

match &#160;

products &#160;

and &#160;

services &#160;

offered &#160;

by &#160;

our &#160;

competitors, &#160;

including &#160;

technology 

companies and &#160;

other nonbank &#160;

firms that &#160;

are engaged &#160;

in providing &#160;

similar products &#160;

and services. &#160;

Although the &#160;

Evertec Business 

Acquisition Transaction eliminated certain &#160;

provisions of a previous Master Services &#160;

Agreement with Evertec that required &#160;

us to use 

Evertec exclusively to develop and implement new or &#160;

enhanced products and services, and is expected to &#160;

improve Popular&#8217;s ability 

to manage and control the development of the customer channels supported by the assets acquired as part of the Evertec Business 

Acquisition Transaction (the &#160;

&#8220;Acquired Assets&#8221;), Popular expects that &#160;

it will continue to &#160;

depend on Evertec&#8217;s technology services &#160;

to 

operate and &#160;

control current &#160;

products and services &#160;

and to &#160;

implement future products &#160;

and services, making &#160;

our success dependent 

on &#160;

Evertec&#8217;s &#160;

ability &#160;

to &#160;

timely &#160;

complete &#160;

and &#160;

introduce &#160;

these &#160;

enhancements &#160;

and &#160;

new &#160;

products &#160;

and &#160;

services &#160;

in &#160;

a &#160;

cost-effective 

manner. &#160;

Our &#160;

ability &#160;

to &#160;

enhance &#160;

our &#160;

customer &#160;

channels &#160;

is &#160;

also &#160;

dependent &#160;

on &#160;

Evertec &#160;

timely &#160;

delivering &#160;

the &#160;

core &#160;

application 

programming interfaces &#160;

(&#8220;Core APIs&#8221;) &#160;

that meet &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s requirements, &#160;

which Evertec &#160;

has committed &#160;

to develop &#160;

under the &#160;

MSA. 

The &#160;

Core &#160;

APIs &#160;

are &#160;

necessary &#160;

for &#160;

BPPR &#160;

to &#160;

connect &#160;

future &#160;

enhancements &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

Acquired &#160;

Assets &#160;

to &#160;

existing &#160;

Evertec &#160;

core 

applications. &#160;

Some &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

competitors &#160;

rely &#160;

on &#160;

financial &#160;

services &#160;

technology &#160;

and &#160;

outsourcing &#160;

companies &#160;

that &#160;

are &#160;

much &#160;

larger &#160;

than 

Evertec, serve a &#160;

greater number of &#160;

clients than Evertec, &#160;

and may have &#160;

better technological capabilities and &#160;

product offerings than 

Evertec. &#160;

Furthermore, &#160;

financial &#160;

services &#160;

technology &#160;

companies &#160;

typically &#160;

make &#160;

capital &#160;

investments &#160;

to &#160;

develop &#160;

and &#160;

modify &#160;

their 

product &#160;

and &#160;

service &#160;

offerings &#160;

to &#160;

facilitate &#160;

their &#160;

customers&#8217; &#160;

compliance &#160;

with &#160;

the &#160;

extensive &#160;

and &#160;

evolving &#160;

regulatory &#160;

and &#160;

industry 

requirements, &#160;

and &#160;

in &#160;

most cases &#160;

such &#160;

costs &#160;

are &#160;

borne &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

technology provider. &#160;

Because &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

contractual &#160;

relationship with 

Evertec, and because Popular is the &#160;

sole customer of certain of &#160;

Evertec&#8217;s services and products, we &#160;

have in the past borne &#160;

the full 

cost of such developments and modifications and &#160;

may be required to do so in the future, subject &#160;

to the terms of the MSA. 

Moreover, &#160;

the terms, &#160;

speed, scalability, &#160;

and functionality &#160;

of certain &#160;

of Evertec&#8217;s &#160;

technology services &#160;

are not &#160;

competitive 

when compared &#160;

to offerings &#160;

from its &#160;

competitors. Evertec&#8217;s &#160;

failure to &#160;

sufficiently invest &#160;

in and &#160;

upscale its &#160;

technology and &#160;

services 

infrastructure to &#160;

meet the &#160;

rapidly changing &#160;

technology demands &#160;

of our &#160;

industry may &#160;

result in &#160;

us being &#160;

unable to &#160;

meet &#160;

customer 

expectations and &#160;

attract or &#160;

retain customers. &#160;

Furthermore, Evertec&#8217;s &#160;

strategy and &#160;

investments may &#160;

also be &#160;

refocused away &#160;

from 

Popular towards &#160;

other strategic &#160;

initiatives as &#160;

a result &#160;

of the &#160;

Evertec Business &#160;

Acquisition Transaction. &#160;

Any such &#160;

impact could, &#160;

in 

turn, reduce Popular&#8217;s revenues, place us in a competitive &#160;

disadvantage and significantly affect our business, financial &#160;

condition and 

results of &#160;

operations. While the &#160;

closing of &#160;

the Evertec &#160;

Business Acquisition Transaction &#160;

narrowed the scope &#160;

of services &#160;

which we 

are dependent on &#160;

Evertec to &#160;

obtain and released &#160;

us from &#160;

exclusivity restrictions that &#160;

limited our &#160;

ability to &#160;

engage other third-party 

providers of financial technology services, it also resulted in extensions of certain existing commercial agreements with Evertec and, 

as a result, have prolonged the duration of our exposure &#160;

to the risks presented by Evertec&#8217;s technological capabilities and &#160;

its failures 

to enhance its products and services and otherwise meet evolving demands. We may also be exposed to heightened business risks 

in connection with our dependency on Evertec with respect to BPPR&#8217;s merchant acquiring business, which exclusivity was extended 

until 2035, &#160;

and with &#160;

respect to the &#160;

ATH &#160;

Network, which commitment &#160;

BPPR extended until &#160;

2030, in &#160;

light of the &#160;

pace of technology 

changes and competition in the payments industry. 

The ability to attract and retain qualified employees &#160;

is critical to our success. 

Our &#160;

success &#160;

depends, &#160;

in &#160;

large &#160;

part, &#160;

on &#160;

our &#160;

ability &#160;

to &#160;

attract &#160;

and &#160;

retain &#160;

qualified &#160;

employees. &#160;

Competition &#160;

for &#160;

qualified 

candidates is intense and has &#160;

increased recently as a result &#160;

of a tighter labor market. Increased &#160;

competition may lead to difficulties 

in &#160;

attracting &#160;

or &#160;

retaining qualified &#160;

employees, which &#160;

may, &#160;

in turn, &#160;

lead to &#160;

significant challenges &#160;

in the &#160;

execution &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

business 

strategies and &#160;

have an &#160;

adverse effect &#160;

on the &#160;

quality of the &#160;

service we &#160;

provide to &#160;

the customers &#160;

and communities we &#160;

serve. Such 

challenges could &#160;

adversely affect &#160;

our business, &#160;

operations and &#160;

financial condition. &#160;

In addition, &#160;

increased competition &#160;

may lead &#160;

to 

higher compensation &#160;

packages and &#160;

more flexible &#160;

work arrangements. &#160;

We may &#160;

also be &#160;

required to &#160;

hire employees &#160;

outside of &#160;

our 

market &#160;

areas &#160;

for &#160;

certain &#160;

positions &#160;

that &#160;

require &#160;

specific &#160;

expertise, &#160;

which &#160;

could &#160;

result &#160;

in &#160;

employment &#160;

and &#160;

tax &#160;

compliance-related 

expenses, challenges and &#160;

risks. In &#160;

addition, flexible &#160;

work arrangements, such &#160;

as remote &#160;

or hybrid &#160;

work models, have &#160;

led to &#160;

other 

workplace &#160;

challenges, &#160;

including fewer &#160;

opportunities &#160;

for &#160;

face-to-face interactions &#160;

or &#160;

to &#160;

promote &#160;

a &#160;

cohesive &#160;

corporate &#160;

culture &#160;

and 

heightened cybersecurity, information security and other operational risks. 

Our &#160;

ability &#160;

to &#160;

attract &#160;

and &#160;

retain &#160;

qualified &#160;

employees &#160;

is &#160;

also &#160;

impacted &#160;

by &#160;

regulatory &#160;

limitations &#160;

on &#160;

our &#160;

compensation 

practices, such as clawback requirements of incentive compensation, which may not affect other institutions with which we compete 

for talent. &#160;

The scope &#160;

and content of &#160;

regulators&#8217; policies &#160;

on executive compensation &#160;

continue to &#160;

develop and are &#160;

likely to &#160;

continue 

evolving. Such policies and limitations on our compensation &#160;

practices could adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate 

talented senior leaders in support of our long-term &#160;

strategy. 

OTHER RISKS 

An impairment &#160;

of our &#160;

goodwill, deferred &#160;

tax assets &#160;

or amortizable &#160;

intangible assets &#160;

could adversely &#160;

affect our &#160;

financial 

condition and results of operations. 

As of &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2023, we &#160;

had approximately &#160;

$804 million, &#160;

$1 billion &#160;

and $102 &#160;

million, respectively, &#160;

of goodwill, &#160;

net 

deferred tax assets and amortizable intangible assets, &#160;

including capitalized software costs, recorded on our &#160;

balance sheet. 

Under &#160;

GAAP, &#160;

goodwill &#160;

is &#160;

tested &#160;

for &#160;

impairment &#160;

at &#160;

least &#160;

annually &#160;

and &#160;

amortizable &#160;

intangible &#160;

assets &#160;

are &#160;

tested &#160;

for 

impairment &#160;

when &#160;

events &#160;

or &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

circumstances indicate &#160;

the &#160;

carrying value &#160;

may &#160;

not &#160;

be &#160;

recoverable. Factors &#160;

that &#160;

may &#160;

be 

considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be 

recoverable, include &#160;

a decline in &#160;

Popular&#8217;s stock price &#160;

related to &#160;

a deterioration in &#160;

global or &#160;

local economic conditions, &#160;

declines in 

our market capitalization, reduced future earnings estimates, and interest rate changes. The goodwill impairment evaluation process 

requires &#160;

us &#160;

to &#160;

make &#160;

estimates &#160;

and &#160;

assumptions &#160;

with &#160;

regards &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

fair &#160;

value &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

reporting &#160;

units. &#160;

Actual &#160;

values &#160;

may &#160;

differ 

significantly &#160;

from &#160;

these &#160;

estimates. &#160;

Such &#160;

differences &#160;

could &#160;

result &#160;

in &#160;

future &#160;

impairment &#160;

of &#160;

goodwill &#160;

that &#160;

would, &#160;

in &#160;

turn, &#160;

negatively 

impact our results of operations and the reporting &#160;

unit where the goodwill is recorded. 

The &#160;

determination &#160;

of &#160;

whether &#160;

a &#160;

deferred &#160;

tax &#160;

asset &#160;

is &#160;

realizable &#160;

is &#160;

based &#160;

on &#160;

weighting &#160;

all &#160;

available &#160;

evidence. &#160;

The 

realization &#160;

of &#160;

deferred &#160;

tax &#160;

assets, including &#160;

carryforwards &#160;

and &#160;

deductible temporary &#160;

differences, &#160;

depends upon &#160;

the &#160;

existence &#160;

of 

sufficient taxable &#160;

income of the &#160;

same character during &#160;

the carryback or &#160;

carryforward period. The &#160;

analysis considers all &#160;

sources of 

taxable income &#160;

available to &#160;

realize the &#160;

deferred tax &#160;

asset, including &#160;

the future &#160;

reversal of &#160;

existing taxable &#160;

temporary differences, 

future taxable income &#160;

exclusive of reversing temporary &#160;

differences and carryforwards, &#160;

taxable income in &#160;

prior carryback years &#160;

and 

tax-planning strategies. Changes in these &#160;

factors may affect &#160;

the realizability of our &#160;

deferred tax assets in &#160;

our Puerto Rico and &#160;

U.S. 

operations. 

If our &#160;

goodwill, deferred &#160;

tax assets &#160;

or amortizable &#160;

intangible assets &#160;

become impaired, &#160;

we may &#160;

be required &#160;

to record &#160;

a 

significant charge to earnings, which could adversely &#160;

affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

We could experience unexpected &#160;

losses if the estimates &#160;

or assumptions we use &#160;

in preparing our financial &#160;

statements are 

incorrect or differ materially from actual results. &#160;

In preparing &#160;

our financial &#160;

statements pursuant to &#160;

U.S. GAAP, &#160;

we are &#160;

required to &#160;

make estimates &#160;

and assumptions &#160;

that 

are often based &#160;

on subjective and &#160;

complex judgments about &#160;

matters that are &#160;

inherently uncertain. For example, &#160;

we use estimates 

and assumptions to determine our allowance for credit losses, our &#160;

liability for contingent litigation losses, and the fair value of certain 

of our &#160;

assets and &#160;

liabilities, such &#160;

as debt &#160;

securities, loans &#160;

held for &#160;

sale, MSRs, &#160;

intangible assets &#160;

and deferred &#160;

tax assets. &#160;

If such 

estimates &#160;

or &#160;

assumptions are &#160;

incorrect &#160;

or &#160;

differ &#160;

materially &#160;

from &#160;

actual &#160;

results, &#160;

we &#160;

could &#160;

experience &#160;

unexpected &#160;

losses &#160;

or &#160;

other 

adverse impacts, some of which could be significant.
