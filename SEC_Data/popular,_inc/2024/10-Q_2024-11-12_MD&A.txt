Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This Form 10-Q &#160;

contains financial information &#160;

prepared under accounting &#160;

principles generally accepted in &#160;

the United States &#160;

(&#8220;U.S. 

GAAP&#8221;) and &#160;

non-GAAP financial &#160;

measures. Management &#160;

uses non-GAAP &#160;

financial measures &#160;

when it &#160;

has determined &#160;

that these 

measures provide &#160;

meaningful information &#160;

about the &#160;

underlying performance &#160;

of the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s ongoing &#160;

operations. Non-GAAP 

financial measures used by the Corporation may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by &#160;

other 

companies. 

Adjusted net income - Non-GAAP Financial Measure 

In &#160;

addition &#160;

to &#160;

analyzing &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

results &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

reported &#160;

basis, &#160;

management &#160;

monitors &#160;

the &#160;

&#8220;adjusted &#160;

net &#160;

income&#8221; &#160;

of &#160;

the 

Corporation and excludes the impact of certain transactions on the results of its operations. Management believes that the &#8220;adjusted 

net &#160;

income&#8221; &#160;

provides &#160;

meaningful &#160;

information &#160;

about &#160;

the &#160;

underlying &#160;

performance &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

ongoing &#160;

operations. &#160;

The 

&#8220;adjusted net income&#8221; is a non-GAAP financial measure. 

The following table presents the &#160;

adjusted net income for the &#160;

nine months ended of September 30, &#160;

2024. &#160;

There were no non-GAAP 

adjustments for the nine months ended September &#160;

30, 2023.

Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis &#160;

&#8211; Non-GAAP Financial Measure 

Net interest &#160;

income on &#160;

a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis &#160;

is a &#160;

non-GAAP financial &#160;

measure. Management &#160;

believes that &#160;

this presentation 

provides meaningful information since it facilitates the comparison &#160;

of revenues arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

interest earning &#160;

assets include &#160;

investment securities &#160;

and loans &#160;

that are &#160;

exempt from &#160;

income tax, &#160;

principally in 

Puerto &#160;

Rico. The &#160;

main sources &#160;

of tax-exempt &#160;

interest income &#160;

are certain &#160;

investments in &#160;

obligations of &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. Government, &#160;

its 

agencies and &#160;

sponsored entities, &#160;

certain obligations &#160;

of the &#160;

Commonwealth of &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

and/or its &#160;

agencies and &#160;

municipalities, 

and assets &#160;

held by the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s international banking &#160;

entities. To &#160;

facilitate the comparison &#160;

of interest related &#160;

to these &#160;

assets, 

net interest income has been converted to a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis, using the applicable statutory &#160;

income tax rates for each period 

on those interest earning assets that are &#160;

tax exempt. In addition, this measure is also &#160;

impacted by a portion of interest cost &#160;

that the 

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

tax &#160;

law &#160;

requires &#160;

to &#160;

be &#160;

disallowed, &#160;

based &#160;

on &#160;

an &#160;

equal &#160;

proportion &#160;

of &#160;

tax-exempt &#160;

assets &#160;

to &#160;

total &#160;

assets, &#160;

and &#160;

by &#160;

an 

allocation of general and &#160;

administrative expenses attributed to &#160;

exempt income, reducing the &#160;

benefit of the tax &#160;

exempt income. The 

effective yield, on &#160;

a taxable equivalent basis, &#160;

will vary depending on &#160;

the level of &#160;

these expenses that are &#160;

attributed to the &#160;

available 

exempt income. 

Net interest income on &#160;

a taxable equivalent basis, with &#160;

its different components, along &#160;

with the reconciliation to net &#160;

interest income 

(GAAP), for the &#160;

quarter ended September 30, &#160;

2024 as compared with &#160;

the same period in &#160;

2023, segregated by major categories &#160;

of 

interest earning assets and interest-bearing &#160;

liabilities are included in Table 3 of the Operating Results Analysis section below.

Financial highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 

&#9679;

&#160;

For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation recorded net income of $ 155.3 million, compared to net income of 

$ &#160;

136.6 &#160;

million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

same &#160;

quarter of &#160;

the &#160;

previous year. &#160;

Net &#160;

interest margin &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

third &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2024 &#160;

was &#160;

3.24%, an 

increase of 17 basis &#160;

points when compared to &#160;

3.07% for the same &#160;

quarter of the previous &#160;

year. The &#160;

increase was mainly due 

to &#160;

higher &#160;

yields &#160;

in &#160;

investment &#160;

securities, &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

reinvestment &#160;

of &#160;

maturities &#160;

in &#160;

higher &#160;

yielding &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Treasury 

securities, and to &#160;

higher average &#160;

loan balances &#160;

and higher &#160;

yields in &#160;

almost all &#160;

loans portfolios, &#160;

which was &#160;

partially offset &#160;

by 

higher deposit &#160;

costs, &#160;

principally due &#160;

to higher &#160;

average volume &#160;

and higher &#160;

cost &#160;

of interest-bearing &#160;

deposits, &#160;

mainly from &#160;

the 

Puerto Rico government and time deposits at PB. On a taxable equivalent basis, the net interest margin was 3.47%, compared 

to 3.24% for the same quarter of the previous year. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation &#160;

recorded a provision for credit losses of $71.4 million, &#160;

compared to 

$45.1 million for &#160;

the same quarter &#160;

of the previous &#160;

year. The &#160;

increase in provision &#160;

for credit losses &#160;

was mainly reflected &#160;

within 

the commercial &#160;

loan portfolio &#160;

for both &#160;

of the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s segments. &#160;

The increase &#160;

was mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

net charge-offs &#160;

in the 

commercial loan &#160;

portfolio during &#160;

the third &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2024, compared &#160;

to net &#160;

recoveries recognized &#160;

during the &#160;

third quarter &#160;

of 

2023, and &#160;

the changes &#160;

in credit &#160;

quality and &#160;

macroeconomic variables. &#160;

In the &#160;

U.S. commercial &#160;

portfolio, the &#160;

release of &#160;

$4.4 

million was &#160;

lower compared &#160;

with the &#160;

third quarter &#160;

of 2023 &#160;

due to &#160;

the impact &#160;

of the &#160;

new model &#160;

for the &#160;

U.S. commercial &#160;

real 

estate segment that was implemented during that &#160;

quarter which resulted in a higher benefit. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Non-interest &#160;

income &#160;

was &#160;

$164.1 &#160;

million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

quarter, &#160;

an &#160;

increase &#160;

of &#160;

$4.5 &#160;

million &#160;

when &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

quarter &#160;

ended 

September 30, &#160;

, mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

higher other &#160;

service fees, &#160;

due to &#160;

higher credit &#160;

and debit &#160;

card service &#160;

fees as &#160;

a result &#160;

of 

higher volume &#160;

of transactions, &#160;

partially offset &#160;

by lower &#160;

income from &#160;

mortgage banking &#160;

activities resulting &#160;

from the &#160;

fair value 

adjustments of mortgage servicing rights. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Operating &#160;

expenses &#160;

of &#160;

$467.3 &#160;

million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

quarter &#160;

were &#160;

higher &#160;

by &#160;

$1.3 &#160;

million &#160;

when &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

quarter &#160;

ended 

September 30, 2023. &#160;

Higher operating expenses &#160;

were driven mainly &#160;

by higher technology &#160;

and software expenses, &#160;

personnel 

costs &#160;

and &#160;

regulatory &#160;

examination &#160;

fees &#160;

included &#160;

as &#160;

other &#160;

taxes, &#160;

partially &#160;

offset &#160;

by &#160;

lower &#160;

professional &#160;

fees &#160;

and &#160;

a &#160;

goodwill 

impairment charge related to our U.S. based leasing &#160;

subsidiary recorded in 2023. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Income tax &#160;

expense of &#160;

$42.5 million &#160;

during the &#160;

quarter was &#160;

lower by &#160;

$3.4 million &#160;

compared to &#160;

the quarter &#160;

ended September 

30, 2023, mainly due to higher exempt income. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Total &#160;

assets at September 30, 2024 amounted to $71.3 billion, compared to $70.8 billion, at &#160;

December 31, 2023. The increase 

was &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

loan &#160;

growth, &#160;

mainly &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

commercial &#160;

portfolio, &#160;

and &#160;

higher &#160;

portfolio &#160;

balance &#160;

in &#160;

available-for-sale &#160;

(&#8220;AFS&#8221;) 

securities, &#160;

impacted &#160;

by &#160;

lower &#160;

unrealized &#160;

losses, &#160;

and &#160;

partially &#160;

offset &#160;

by &#160;

a &#160;

decrease &#160;

in &#160;

held-to-maturity &#160;

(&#8220;HTM&#8221;) &#160;

investment 

securities driven by maturities of U.S. Treasury securities. 

&#9679;

Total &#160;

deposits at &#160;

September 30, &#160;

2024 increased &#160;

by $50.3 &#160;

million when &#160;

compared to &#160;

deposits at &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2023, mainly 

due to higher deposits in PB, mainly those captured &#160;

via the online channel.

&#9679;

&#160;

Stockholders&#8217; equity &#160;

as of &#160;

September 30, &#160;

2024 increased &#160;

by $643.6 &#160;

million from &#160;

the December &#160;

31, 2023, &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to net 

income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of $436.4 million, the after-tax impact of the decrease in net unrealized 

losses &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

portfolio &#160;

of &#160;

AFS &#160;

securities &#160;

of &#160;

$272.0 &#160;

million &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

net &#160;

accretion &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

discount &#160;

from &#160;

securities &#160;

previously 

reclassified to HTM of $107.0 million, &#160;

net of taxes, partially offset &#160;

by the repurchases of common stock &#160;

for $58.8 million during 

the &#160;

third &#160;

quarter &#160;

and &#160;

dividends &#160;

declared &#160;

during &#160;

the &#160;

period &#160;

of &#160;

$135.4 &#160;

million. &#160;

As &#160;

of &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2024, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s 

tangible book value per common share was $69.04, &#160;

an increase of $9.30 from December 31, &#160;

2023.

These estimates &#160;

are made &#160;

under facts &#160;

and circumstances &#160;

at a &#160;

OPERATING RESULTS ANALYSIS 

NET INTEREST INCOME 

Net interest income for &#160;

the quarter ended September &#160;

30, 2024 was $572.5 &#160;

million, compared to $534.0 &#160;

million in the same &#160;

quarter 

of 2023, &#160;

an increase &#160;

of $38.5 &#160;

million. Net &#160;

interest income &#160;

on a &#160;

taxable equivalent &#160;

basis for &#160;

the third &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2024 was &#160;

$612.9 

million compared to $563.7 million in the third &#160;

quarter of 2023, an increase of $49.2 million. &#160;

Net interest margin for the quarter &#160;

was 3.24% compared to 3.07% in the &#160;

third quarter of 2023 or an &#160;

increase of 17 basis points. On 

a taxable equivalent basis, net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.47%, compared to 3.24% for the same quarter the 

prior year. The main variances in net interest income on a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis were: &#160;

&#9679;

higher interest income from &#160;

investment securities by $33.8 &#160;

million mainly driven higher &#160;

yield by 48 &#160;

basis points, due to &#160;

a 

higher interest rate environment and reinvestment &#160;

of investment maturities in higher yielding U.S. &#160;

Treasury bills; 

&#9679;

higher interest income from &#160;

loans by $69.6 million &#160;

resulting from higher balances in &#160;

both PB and BPPR &#160;

and across most 

portfolios and higher yield on loans by 32 basis &#160;

points when compared to the same quarter &#160;

of 2023. 

Partially offset by: 

&#9679;

higher interest expense &#160;

on interest-bearing deposits &#160;

by $56.9 million &#160;

driven by a &#160;

higher cost of &#160;

interest-bearing deposits 

by 41 basis points &#160;

due to higher average volume &#160;

by $884.1 million and &#160;

higher cost of market &#160;

linked interest-bearing P.R. 

Government deposits and higher volume of U.S. &#160;

deposits, mainly those captured via the online channel. 

Net interest income &#160;

for the BPPR &#160;

segment amounted to &#160;

$488.0 million for &#160;

the third quarter &#160;

of 2024, compared &#160;

to $453.9 million &#160;

in 

the third &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2023. Net interest &#160;

margin increased to &#160;

3.41% compared to &#160;

3.14% in the &#160;

third quarter of &#160;

2023. The increase &#160;

in 

net interest income of $34.1 &#160;

million was driven by higher &#160;

yields from earning assets and loan &#160;

growth partially offset by the &#160;

increase 

in the &#160;

cost of &#160;

deposits, mainly &#160;

from P.R. &#160;

Government deposits. &#160;

The cost &#160;

of interest-bearing &#160;

deposits increased &#160;

29 basis &#160;

points to 

2.55% from 2.25% in &#160;

the same quarter of &#160;

2023. Total &#160;

deposit costs for the quarter &#160;

increased by 21 basis &#160;

points, from 1.68% in the 

third quarter of 2023 to 1.89%. 

Net interest income for &#160;

PB was $93.1 million &#160;

for the quarter ended &#160;

September 30, 2024, compared to &#160;

$87.4 million during the &#160;

third 

quarter of &#160;

2023, &#160;

an &#160;

increase of &#160;

$5.7 million. &#160;

Net interest &#160;

margin &#160;

decreased 17 &#160;

basis &#160;

points to &#160;

2.73% &#160;

when compared &#160;

to &#160;

2.90% 

during the third &#160;

quarter of 2023. &#160;

The decrease in &#160;

net interest margin &#160;

was mostly driven &#160;

by higher balances &#160;

and cost of &#160;

deposits in 

most &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

interest-bearing &#160;

categories, &#160;

partially &#160;

offset &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

increase &#160;

in &#160;

loan &#160;

volume &#160;

and &#160;

yield. &#160;

The &#160;

cost &#160;

of &#160;

interest-bearing 

deposits was 3.80% compared to 3.31% in the third quarter of 2023, &#160;

or an increase of 49 basis points. &#160;

Total deposit cost was 3.35% 

compared to 2.84%, or a decrease of 51 basis &#160;

points in the third quarter of 2023.

Note: The changes that are not due solely to volume or &#160;

rate are allocated to volume and rate based on the &#160;

proportion of the change in each category. 

[1] Average balances exclude unrealized gains or losses &#160;

on debt securities available-for-sale and the unrealized &#160;

loss related to certain securities transferred from 

available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. 

[2] Includes interest bearing demand deposits corresponding &#160;

to certain government entities in Puerto Rico. 

Net interest income for the nine months &#160;

ended September 30, 2024 was $1.7 billion, or $94.2 million higher than the same period in 

2023. Taxable &#160;

equivalent net interest income &#160;

was $1.8 billion, &#160;

an increase of &#160;

$124.8 million when compared &#160;

to the same &#160;

period in 

2023. &#160;

Net &#160;

interest &#160;

margin &#160;

was &#160;

3.20%, &#160;

an &#160;

increase &#160;

of &#160;

six &#160;

basis &#160;

points &#160;

when &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

3.14% &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

nine &#160;

months &#160;

ended 

September 30, &#160;

2023. The &#160;

increase in &#160;

net interest &#160;

margin was &#160;

mainly driven &#160;

by a &#160;

higher yield &#160;

on earning &#160;

assets due &#160;

to a &#160;

higher 

interest rate environment. &#160;

Net interest margin, &#160;

on a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis, for &#160;

the nine months &#160;

ended September 30, 2024, &#160;

was 

3.44%, an increase of 12 basis points when compared to the 3.32% for the same period of &#160;

2023. The drivers of the variances in net 

interest income for the nine-month period are: &#160;

Positive variances: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

income &#160;

from &#160;

investment securities &#160;

by &#160;

$156.8 million &#160;

resulting from &#160;

higher yield &#160;

of &#160;

the portfolio &#160;

by &#160;

62 &#160;

basis 

points driven by the &#160;

re-investment of maturities and deployment of &#160;

liquidity to higher yield short-term &#160;

Treasury bills, for which 

interest is tax exempt in Puerto Rico; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income from loans by &#160;

$249.5 million reflecting higher interest income from commercial loans &#160;

by $122.9 million 

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

yield &#160;

by &#160;

37 &#160;

basis &#160;

points &#160;

related &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

rates &#160;

in &#160;

adjustable-rate &#160;

loans &#160;

and &#160;

higher &#160;

volume &#160;

of &#160;

$1.5 &#160;

billion, 

increasing in BPPR and PB, and higher volume and &#160;

yield across the rest of the portfolios as shown in &#160;

Table 4; and 

partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

expense from &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$289.6 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to &#160;

the increase &#160;

in interest &#160;

rates that &#160;

has resulted &#160;

in a 

higher cost in most deposit &#160;

categories in both BPPR and PB; &#160;

but particularly from P.R &#160;

Government deposits that are market-

linked and PB online deposits.

Provision for Credit Losses - Loans Held-in-Portfolio &#160;

and Unfunded Commitments 

For the quarter &#160;

ended September 30, &#160;

2024, the Corporation &#160;

recorded a provision &#160;

for credit losses &#160;

related to loans &#160;

held-in-portfolio 

and unfunded commitments &#160;

of $72.3 million, &#160;

an increase of &#160;

$27.1 million, compared to &#160;

the same quarter &#160;

of the previous &#160;

year. The 

provision for the loan portfolio increased by $29.3 million. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the 

movement of the allowance for credit losses. The drivers of &#160;

the increase in the provision for loan losses by business &#160;

segments when 

comparing the third quarter of 2024, &#160;

to the same quarter in 2023 were &#160;

as follows: 

&#9679;

&#160;

In the BPPR segment, &#160;

the provision for credit losses increased &#160;

by $23.1 million, to $77.1 million. The increase was mainly 

reflected within the &#160;

commercial loan portfolio &#160;

driven by net &#160;

charge-offs, instead of &#160;

net recoveries for &#160;

the same &#160;

quarter in 

2023, along with changes in credit quality and &#160;

macroeconomic variables. 

&#9679;

&#160;

In the Popular U.S. segment, &#160;

a release of $4.4 million &#160;

was recorded for the quarter ended &#160;

September 30, 2024 driven by 

changes in &#160;

credit quality, &#160;

and improvements in &#160;

credit ratings &#160;

related to &#160;

the commercial &#160;

portfolio. This release &#160;

was lower 

when &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

same &#160;

quarter &#160;

in &#160;

2023 &#160;

for &#160;

which &#160;

a &#160;

release &#160;

of &#160;

$10.5 &#160;

million &#160;

was &#160;

recorded mainly &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

the 

implementation of a new model for the U.S. &#160;

commercial real estate portfolio based on more &#160;

granular regional data. 

For &#160;

the &#160;

nine &#160;

months &#160;

ended &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2024, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

recorded &#160;

a &#160;

provision &#160;

for &#160;

credit &#160;

loss &#160;

related &#160;

to &#160;

loans &#160;

held-in-

portfolio and unfunded commitments of $190.7 million, an increase of $59.9 million, compared to the nine months ended September 

30, 2023. The provision &#160;

for the loan portfolio increased &#160;

by $63.0 million. The &#160;

drivers of the increase in &#160;

the provision for loan &#160;

losses 

by business segments when comparing the nine months &#160;

ended September 30, 2024, to the same period &#160;

in 2023 were as follows: 

&#9679;

&#160;

In the BPPR segment, the provision for loan losses was of $186.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 

compared &#160;

to &#160;

$127.6 &#160;

million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

nine &#160;

months &#160;

ended &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2023, &#160;

attributable &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

reserves &#160;

in &#160;

the 

commercial, auto leases and consumer portfolios due &#160;

to loan growth, &#160;

higher losses, and changes in credit quality. 

&#9679;

&#160;

In &#160;

the Popular &#160;

U.S. segment, &#160;

the provision &#160;

for loan &#160;

losses was &#160;

an expense &#160;

of &#160;

$2.6 &#160;

million for &#160;

the nine &#160;

months ended 

September 30, 2024, compared to &#160;

a release of $1.3 &#160;

million for the same &#160;

period in 2023. The &#160;

higher provision was driven 

by the &#160;

reduction in reserves &#160;

during the same &#160;

period of &#160;

2023 due to &#160;

the implementation of &#160;

a new &#160;

model, based on &#160;

more 

granular regional data, for the U.S. commercial real &#160;

estate portfolio. 

At &#160;

September 30, &#160;

2024, the &#160;

total &#160;

allowance for &#160;

credit &#160;

losses for &#160;

loans held-in-portfolio &#160;

amounted to &#160;

$744.3 million, &#160;

compared to 

$729.3 &#160;

as &#160;

of &#160;

Non-Interest Income 

Non-interest &#160;

income &#160;

amounted to &#160;

$164.1 &#160;

million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2024, compared &#160;

to &#160;

$159.5 million &#160;

for &#160;

the 

same quarter of the previous year. The main factors that contributed &#160;

to the variance in non-interest income were: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other service fees by $5.3 million &#160;

mainly due to higher credit and debit &#160;

card service fees as a result &#160;

of higher volume of 

transactions; 

partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower income from mortgage banking activities by &#160;

$2.7 million mainly due to a &#160;

decrease in the fair value of &#160;

mortgage servicing 

rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;). 

Non-interest income amounted to $494.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $482.0 million for the 

same period of the previous year. The main factors that contributed to &#160;

the variance in non-interest income were: &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other service &#160;

fees by $12.1 &#160;

million mainly due &#160;

to an increase &#160;

in debit and &#160;

credit cards fees &#160;

due to higher &#160;

transactional 

volume and higher income from the sale and &#160;

administration of investment products; &#160;

and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

service &#160;

charges &#160;

on &#160;

deposit &#160;

accounts &#160;

by &#160;

$3.5 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

fees &#160;

resulting &#160;

mainly &#160;

from &#160;

non-balance 

compensation in commercial deposits; 

partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower &#160;

mortgage &#160;

banking &#160;

activities &#160;

by &#160;

$2.4 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

decrease &#160;

in &#160;

mortgage &#160;

servicing &#160;

fees &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher 

delinquencies in the serviced portfolio. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating &#160;

expenses &#160;

amounted &#160;

to &#160;

$467.3 &#160;

million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

quarter &#160;

ended &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2024, &#160;

an &#160;

increase &#160;

of &#160;

$1.3 &#160;

million, &#160;

when 

compared with the same quarter of 2023. The &#160;

variance in operating expenses was driven primarily &#160;

by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

technology &#160;

and &#160;

software &#160;

expenses &#160;

by &#160;

$15.5 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

IT &#160;

consulting &#160;

fees &#160;

by &#160;

$5.8 &#160;

million, &#160;

higher 

software amortization expense by $3.9 million and an &#160;

increase of $2.9 million from network management &#160;

services; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other taxes expense by $9.2 million mainly due the reversal of an accrual of &#160;

$8.2 million during the third quarter of 2023 

related to regulatory examination fees in BPPR; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher personnel costs by $8.7 million mainly due to higher &#160;

salaries by $8.2 million as a result of annual salary &#160;

revisions and an 

increase in headcount; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

business &#160;

promotion &#160;

expenses &#160;

by &#160;

$2.6 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

donations &#160;

granted &#160;

during &#160;

the &#160;

quarter, &#160;

higher 

advertising costs and higher customer rewards programs &#160;

expense in our credit card business; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower other &#160;

real estate &#160;

owned (OREO) &#160;

benefit by &#160;

$2.5 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to lower &#160;

gain on &#160;

sale of &#160;

mortgage and &#160;

commercial 

properties; 

partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

a goodwill &#160;

impairment charge &#160;

of $23.0 &#160;

million recorded &#160;

during the &#160;

third quarter &#160;

of 2023 &#160;

in our &#160;

U.S. based &#160;

equipment leasing 

subsidiary due to lower forecasted cash flows and &#160;

an increase in the rate used to discount cash &#160;

flows; 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower professional fees by $11.8 million mainly due to a decrease in advisory &#160;

expenses arising from corporate initiatives; &#160;

and 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower processing &#160;

and transactional &#160;

services expenses &#160;

by $3.6 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

lower point &#160;

of service &#160;

(POS) processing 

fees,

driven by a lower fee rate and higher &#160;

incentive rebates in 2024. 

Operating expenses &#160;

amounted to &#160;

$1.4 billion &#160;

for the &#160;

nine months &#160;

ended September &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

an increase &#160;

of $53.1 &#160;

million when 

compared with the &#160;

same period of &#160;

2023. Excluding the &#160;

$6.4 million of &#160;

interest accrued related &#160;

to prior period &#160;

tax withholdings and 

the $14.3 million impact of the FDIC Special Assessment, total &#160;

expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 

by $32.4 million, when compared with the same &#160;

period of 2023. The main drivers of &#160;

the $32.4 million variance were: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher technology &#160;

and software &#160;

expenses by &#160;

$33.8 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

IT professional &#160;

fees by &#160;

$11.2 &#160;

million, higher 

software amortization expense by $9.7 million, an increase of $7.6 million from network management services and an increase 

of $2.4 million in application processing and &#160;

hosting services; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher personnel costs by $31.3 million mainly due to higher salaries by $15.9 million as a result of annual salary revisions and 

an &#160;

increase &#160;

in &#160;

headcount, &#160;

an &#160;

increase &#160;

in &#160;

restricted &#160;

shares, &#160;

commissions &#160;

and &#160;

incentive &#160;

compensation &#160;

by &#160;

$9.6 &#160;

million &#160;

and 

higher payroll taxes and other compensation expenses &#160;

by $5.3 million; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other taxes expense by $6.2 million &#160;

mainly due to an increase in &#160;

municipal license tax and to the impact &#160;

of the reversal 

in 2023 of regulatory examination fees in BPPR, &#160;

as mentioned above; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

promotion &#160;

expenses &#160;

by &#160;

$5.0 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher donations, &#160;

advertising &#160;

and &#160;

sponsorship &#160;

expenses &#160;

by &#160;

$3.0 

million and higher customer rewards programs expense &#160;

in our credit card business by $2.0 million; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher operational losses by $4.6 million due to &#160;

build up on reserves for operational losses; 

partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower &#160;

professional &#160;

fees &#160;

by &#160;

$28.7 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

advisory &#160;

expenses &#160;

arising &#160;

from &#160;

corporate &#160;

initiatives &#160;

including &#160;

those 

related to the Corporation's transformation initiative &#160;

incurred during the nine months ended September &#160;

Income Taxes 

For the quarter and nine months &#160;

ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation recorded an income &#160;

tax expense of $42.5 million and 

$138.5 million with an effective &#160;

tax rate (ETR) of &#160;

21.5% and 24.1%, respectively, &#160;

compared to $45.9 million and &#160;

$135.7 million with 

an ETR &#160;

of 25.1% and &#160;

23.3% for the &#160;

respective periods of &#160;

2023. &#160;

The lower &#160;

income tax expense &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter ended September 

30, 2024, compared &#160;

to the same &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2023, is mostly &#160;

due to the &#160;

higher exempt income &#160;

recorded for the &#160;

current quarter. &#160;

For 

the nine &#160;

months ended &#160;

September 30, &#160;

2024, the &#160;

higher income &#160;

tax reflects &#160;

the tax &#160;

withholding expense &#160;

recorded during &#160;

the first 

quarter on &#160;

certain intercompany &#160;

distributions, amounting &#160;

to $22.9 &#160;

million, out &#160;

of which &#160;

$16.5 million &#160;

corresponded to &#160;

years 2014-

2023 and $6.5 &#160;

million was related &#160;

to a &#160;

distribution completed during the &#160;

period ended March &#160;

31, 2024; this &#160;

negative variance was 

partially offset &#160;

by the &#160;

lower income &#160;

before tax, &#160;

higher exempt &#160;

income and &#160;

other tax &#160;

credits recorded &#160;

this year, &#160;

compared with &#160;

the 

same period of year 2023. &#160;

At September &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

had a &#160;

net deferred &#160;

tax asset &#160;

amounting to &#160;

$916 million, &#160;

net of &#160;

a valuation &#160;

allowance of 

$451 million. The net deferred tax asset related &#160;

to the U.S. operations was $250 million, net of &#160;

a valuation allowance of $379 million.

REPORTABLE SEGMENT RESULTS 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

reportable segments &#160;

for managerial &#160;

reporting purposes &#160;

consist of &#160;

Banco Popular &#160;

de Puerto &#160;

Rico and &#160;

Popular 

U.S. A Corporate group &#160;

has also been defined to support the reportable &#160;

segments. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

For &#160;

a &#160;

description &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

reportable &#160;

segments, &#160;

including &#160;

additional &#160;

financial &#160;

information &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

underlying 

management accounting process, refer to Note 32 &#160;

to the Consolidated Financial Statements. &#160;

The Corporate group reported a net &#160;

income of $0.5 million for the &#160;

quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared with &#160;

a net income 

of &#160;

$2.8 million &#160;

for the &#160;

same quarter &#160;

of &#160;

the previous &#160;

year. &#160;

For the &#160;

nine months &#160;

ended September &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

the Corporate &#160;

group 

reported net loss of &#160;

$21.7 million, compared to &#160;

a net income &#160;

of $8.8 million for &#160;

the same period of &#160;

the previous year. &#160;

The negative 

variance was mainly attributed to the $22.9 million adjustment to recognize the tax impact associated with prior period intercompany 

distributions and &#160;

the additional &#160;

$6.5 million &#160;

recognized for the &#160;

tax impact related &#160;

to intercompany &#160;

distributions paid during &#160;

the first 

quarter of 2024. &#160;

Highlights on the earnings results for the reportable &#160;

segments are discussed below: 

Banco Popular de Puerto Rico &#160;

The Banco Popular &#160;

de Puerto Rico &#160;

reportable segment&#8217;s net &#160;

income amounted to &#160;

$125.8 million for &#160;

the quarter ended &#160;

September 

30, 2024, compared with &#160;

net income of $122.7 &#160;

million for the same &#160;

quarter of the previous year. &#160;

The factors that contributed to &#160;

the 

variance in the financial results included the following: &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher net interest income by $34.1 million mainly &#160;

due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income from money market &#160;

and investment securities by $4.9 million &#160;

due to higher yields driven 

by the reinvestment into higher interest rates U.S. &#160;

Treasury securities; &#160;

and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income from loans by $53.6 million &#160;

mainly due to higher average balances across all portfolios; 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest expense on deposits by $23.9 million mainly due to the higher interest rate environment&#8217;s impact 

on the cost of P.R. Government deposits. 

The net interest margin &#160;

for the quarter ended &#160;

September 30, 2024 was 3.41% &#160;

compared to 3.14% for the &#160;

same quarter in the 

previous year. &#160;

The increase in &#160;

net interest margin &#160;

is driven by &#160;

the earnings assets &#160;

mix and the &#160;

higher yields from &#160;

investment 

securities and loans, particularly commercial and consumer loans, due to the increase in rates; partially offset by &#160;

higher cost of 

deposits.

&#9679;

&#160;

A &#160;

provision for &#160;

loan &#160;

losses &#160;

of &#160;

$77.1 million, &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

provision of &#160;

$54.2 &#160;

million &#160;

in &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

September &#160;

30, 

2023, higher by &#160;

$22.9 million mainly &#160;

in the commercial &#160;

portfolio due to &#160;

net charge offs &#160;

as compared to &#160;

net recoveries in 

2023, and changes in credit quality in the commercial &#160;

portfolio; &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Non-interest income was higher by $4.4 million mainly &#160;

due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other service &#160;

fees by $4.3 &#160;

million due to &#160;

higher interchange income from &#160;

debit and credit &#160;

card as result 

of higher volume of transactions and higher ancillary &#160;

fees; 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower income &#160;

from mortgage &#160;

banking activities &#160;

by $2.6 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

an unfavorable &#160;

variance of &#160;

$2.0 

million in the fair value adjustment of mortgage service &#160;

rights; 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher operating expenses by $20.6 million mostly due &#160;

to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

technology &#160;

and &#160;

software &#160;

expenses &#160;

by &#160;

$9.9 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

IT &#160;

professional &#160;

fees, &#160;

higher 

amortization of software costs and higher network management &#160;

fees; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other operating taxes by $9.4 million due &#160;

to the accrual reversal in the quarter ended September &#160;

30,2023 

related to regulatory examination fees in BPPR by &#160;

$8.2 million; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher personnel costs by $4.0 million driven by &#160;

annual salary revisions, and an increase in headcount; 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower net recoveries from &#160;

OREO by $2.5 million &#160;

mainly due to lower &#160;

gain on sale &#160;

of mortgage and commercial 

properties; and 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower &#160;

processing &#160;

and &#160;

transactional &#160;

services &#160;

by &#160;

$3.5 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

lower &#160;

point &#160;

of &#160;

service &#160;

(&#8220;POS&#8221;) 

processing fees, driven by a lower fee rate and higher &#160;

incentive rebates in 2024; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower professional fees of $6.1 million mainly due &#160;

to lower consulting fees related to corporate initiatives; 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower income tax expense by $10.8 million is mainly &#160;

due to higher net exempt income. &#160;

For &#160;

the &#160;

nine months &#160;

ended September &#160;

30, &#160;

2024, the &#160;

BPPR segment &#160;

recorded net &#160;

income &#160;

of &#160;

$404.3 million &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

net 

income of $387.4 million for the same period of the previous year. The factors that contributed to the variance in the financial results 

included the following: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher net interest income by $92.8 million &#160;

mainly due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income from money market and investment &#160;

securities by $77.5 million due to higher yields driven 

by the re-investments of maturities and deployment &#160;

of liquidity to higher yield U.S. Treasury securities; &#160;

and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

income from &#160;

loans by &#160;

$183.0 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

average balances &#160;

from commercial 

and consumer loans, 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

expense on &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$166.9 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

costs on &#160;

the market-linked &#160;

Puerto 

Rico government deposits. 

The net interest &#160;

margin for the &#160;

nine months ended September &#160;

30, 2024 was &#160;

3.38% compared to &#160;

3.24% for the &#160;

same period in &#160;

the 

previous &#160;

year. &#160;

The &#160;

increase &#160;

in &#160;

net &#160;

interest &#160;

margin &#160;

is &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

earnings &#160;

assets &#160;

mix &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

higher &#160;

yields &#160;

from &#160;

investment 

securities and loans, due to the increase in &#160;

rates; partially offset by higher cost of deposits. 

&#9679;

&#160;

An &#160;

unfavorable variance &#160;

of &#160;

$58.8 &#160;

million &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

provision for &#160;

loan &#160;

losses &#160;

mainly &#160;

attributable to &#160;

higher reserves &#160;

in &#160;

the 

commercial, auto leases and consumer portfolios &#160;

due to loan growth, higher losses, and changes &#160;

in credit quality; &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Non-interest income was higher by $11.1 million mainly due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other service fees by $9.4 million mainly due to higher debit and credit card fees by $5.0 million as result 

of higher volume of customer transactions; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

service &#160;

charges &#160;

on &#160;

deposit &#160;

accounts &#160;

by &#160;

$3.6 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

fees &#160;

from &#160;

non- &#160;

balance 

compensation in commercial deposits; 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower income &#160;

from mortgage &#160;

banking activities &#160;

by $2.3 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

an unfavorable &#160;

variance of &#160;

$2.0 

million in the fair value adjustment of mortgage service &#160;

rights. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher operating expenses by $53.6 million mostly due &#160;

to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

personnel &#160;

costs &#160;

by &#160;

$19.3 &#160;

million &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

annual &#160;

salary &#160;

revisions, &#160;

an &#160;

increase &#160;

in &#160;

headcount, &#160;

an 

increase in restricted shares, higher commissions and &#160;

incentive compensation, and an increase in payroll &#160;

taxes; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher technology and software expenses by $19.0 million mainly due to higher amortization of software, higher 

IT consulting fees, higher network management fees &#160;

and higher application and hosting services;

the &#160;

Corporate &#160;

segment 

group; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other operating taxes by $5.7 million due to reversal in the nine-month period ended September 30,2023 

related to regulatory examination fees in BPPR by &#160;

$8.2 million; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher business promotions by $4.0 million due to higher donations, &#160;

advertising and sponsorship expenses, and 

higher customer rewards expense in credit card business; 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower professional &#160;

fees of &#160;

$17.5 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to &#160;

lower advisory &#160;

with several &#160;

initiatives 

including the Corporations transformation initiatives; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher net &#160;

recoveries from &#160;

OREO by &#160;

$3.6 million &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower income &#160;

tax &#160;

expense of &#160;

recorded 

during this period.

to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

based leasing &#160;

subsidiary of &#160;

$23.0 million &#160;

recorded in &#160;

the 

third &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2023, due &#160;

to &#160;

lower forecasted &#160;

cash flows &#160;

and &#160;

an increase &#160;

in the &#160;

rate used &#160;

to &#160;

discount cash 

flows; 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher personnel costs and technology and software &#160;

expenses by $3.6 million; 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher income tax expense by $7.1 million is related &#160;

to higher income before tax. 

For the &#160;

nine months &#160;

ended September &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

the reportable &#160;

segment of &#160;

Popular U.S. &#160;

recorded a &#160;

net income &#160;

of $53.6 &#160;

million, 

compared with a net income of $51.3 million for the same period of the previous year. &#160;

The factors that contributed to the variance in 

the financial results included the following: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower net interest income by $1.2 million due &#160;

to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

expense on &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$114.6 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

higher interest &#160;

rates and &#160;

higher average 

balance; 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

income from &#160;

loans by &#160;

$61.0 million, &#160;

mainly from &#160;

growth in &#160;

the commercial &#160;

portfolio as &#160;

well as 

higher yields due to higher rates; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income &#160;

from money market &#160;

and investment securities &#160;

by $49.6 million &#160;

due to higher &#160;

yields and 

higher average balance. 

The net interest margin for &#160;

the nine months ended September &#160;

30, 2024 was 2.64% compared to &#160;

3.08% for the same quarter &#160;

in the 

previous year. 

&#9679;

&#160;

An unfavorable variance of $3.8 million &#160;

on the provision for loan losses reflecting &#160;

a release mainly due to the reduction &#160;

in 

reserves in 2023 &#160;

due to the &#160;

implementation of a &#160;

new model, based &#160;

on more granular &#160;

regional performance, for &#160;

the U.S. 

commercial real estate portfolio; 

&#9679;

&#160;

A favorable variance of $5.4 million in the reserve &#160;

for unfunded commitments, mainly related to &#160;

the construction portfolio; 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower operating expenses by $8.0 million mostly &#160;

due to: &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

the goodwill impairment &#160;

charge related to &#160;

our U.S. based &#160;

leasing subsidiary of &#160;

$23.0 million recorded in &#160;

2023, 

due to lower forecasted cash flows and an increase &#160;

in the rate used to discount cash flows; 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

lower professional fees of &#160;

$4.0 million mainly due &#160;

to lower costs associated with &#160;

corporate initiatives and lower 

legal fees; 

partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher personnel costs by $2.1 million driven by &#160;

higher annual salary revisions and increase in headcount; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

technology &#160;

and &#160;

software &#160;

expenses &#160;

by &#160;

$5.5 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

network &#160;

management &#160;

fees, 

higher amortization of software costs and higher IT &#160;

consulting fees; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

other &#160;

operating &#160;

expense &#160;

by &#160;

$5.7 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

charges &#160;

allocated &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

Corporate 

segment group; &#160;

and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher FDIC deposit insurance expense by $5.3 &#160;

million mostly due to FDIC Special Assessment; 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher income tax expense by $7.7 million due &#160;

to a higher net income before income tax. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION ANALYSIS &#160;

Assets 

The Corporation&#8217;s total assets were $71.3 &#160;

billion at September 30, 2024, &#160;

compared to $70.8 billion at December &#160;

31, 2023. Refer to 

the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition &#160;

included in this report for additional information. &#160;

Money market investments and debt securities available-for-sale &#160;

and held-to-maturity 

Money market investments decreased by &#160;

$468.1 million as of &#160;

September 30, 2024, when &#160;

compared to December 31, &#160;

2023, driven 

by lower &#160;

deposits and &#160;

loan growth. &#160;

Debt securities available-for-sale &#160;

increased $457.1 &#160;

million, mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

reinvestment of &#160;

U.S. 

Treasury Securities &#160;

and the &#160;

decrease in &#160;

the unrealized &#160;

losses of &#160;

AFS securities &#160;

of $329.0 million. &#160;

Debt securities &#160;

held-to-maturity 

decreased by &#160;

$328.7 million &#160;

driven by &#160;

maturities and &#160;

paydowns, partially &#160;

offset by &#160;

the accretion &#160;

of $133.8 &#160;

million of &#160;

the discount 

related to U.S. Treasury &#160;

securities previously reclassified from the &#160;

AFS to HTM. &#160;

breakdown of the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

loan portfolio. Also, refer &#160;

to Note 7 in &#160;

the Consolidated Financial Statements 

for detailed information about the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio &#160;

composition and loan purchases and sales. &#160;

Loans held-in-portfolio &#160;

increased by &#160;

$1.1 billion &#160;

to $36.2 &#160;

billion as &#160;

of September &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

compared to &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2023. The 

BPPR portfolio increased by $1.2 billion, driven by the growth in the commercial, mortgage &#160;

and auto loan portfolios, and the PB loan 

portfolio decreased by $0.1 billion, due in part &#160;

by commercial loans payoffs, offset by growth in the &#160;

construction loan portfolio. 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

$5.2 billion &#160;

non-owner occupied &#160;

commercial real &#160;

estate portfolio &#160;

is comprised &#160;

of $3.2 &#160;

billion in &#160;

BPPR and &#160;

$2.0 

billion in Popular U.S. and &#160;

is well diversified across a number &#160;

of tenants in different industries &#160;

and segments with exposure to retail 

(34% &#160;

of &#160;

non-owner &#160;

occupied &#160;

CRE), &#160;

hotels &#160;

(19%) &#160;

and &#160;

office &#160;

space &#160;

(14%) &#160;

accounting &#160;

for &#160;

two &#160;

thirds &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

total &#160;

exposure. &#160;

The 

approximate $708 million office space &#160;

exposure represents only 2.0% of &#160;

the total loan portfolio &#160;

and is comprised mainly of &#160;

mid-rise 

properties with diversified tenants with average loan &#160;

size of $2 million across both BPPR and Popular &#160;

U.S. 

Popular&#8217;s $2.4 billion commercial multi-family &#160;

portfolio represents approximately 7% of &#160;

total loans and is &#160;

concentrated in New York 

Metro ($1.5 &#160;

billion), South Florida ($698 million) &#160;

and Puerto Rico ($192 &#160;

million). In the New York &#160;

Metro region, the Corporation has 

no exposure to rent controlled buildings. The &#160;

rent stabilized units represent less than &#160;

40% of the total units in &#160;

the loan portfolio with 

the majority originated after 2019.

September 30, 2024, compared to $63.6 billion as &#160;

of December 31, 2023. An 

increase in the P.R. public sector, as well as an increase in interest-bearing deposits, were the main drivers of the $0.1 &#160;

billion 

increase during the period. &#160;

Excluding &#160;

P.R &#160;

. &#160;

public &#160;

deposits, &#160;

as &#160;

of &#160;

2024, &#160;

deposits &#160;

amounted &#160;

to &#160;

compared &#160;

$45.6 &#160;

billion &#160;

as &#160;

of 

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2023. &#160;

This &#160;

$0.6 &#160;

billion &#160;

decrease &#160;

includes &#160;

a &#160;

reduction &#160;

of &#160;

approximately &#160;

$0.9 &#160;

billion &#160;

in &#160;

low-cost &#160;

interest-bearing 

deposits, partially offset by a $0.5 billion increase &#160;

in higher cost interest-bearing deposits, mainly related to time deposits in Popular 

Bank. &#160;

In BPPR, deposit &#160;

balances, excluding P.R &#160;

public funds, have been &#160;

impacted during 2023 and &#160;

2024 by outflows driven &#160;

by changes 

in client &#160;

behavior, &#160;

mainly by &#160;

commercial and &#160;

affluent retail &#160;

clients seeking &#160;

products that &#160;

provide for &#160;

high rates &#160;

in the &#160;

current rate 

environment, along with significant spending and use &#160;

of balances including the retail client base, which &#160;

had experienced an increase 

in average deposit balances during the pandemic driven by federal incentives. Notwithstanding this decrease, average retail deposit 

balances at BPPR are still higher than pre-pandemic &#160;

levels. 

As &#160;

of &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2024, &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

public &#160;

sector &#160;

deposits &#160;

amounted &#160;

to &#160;

$18.7 &#160;

billion, &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

$18.1 &#160;

billion &#160;

as &#160;

of 

December 31, 2023. 

Approximately 29% of the Corporation&#8217;s deposits as of September 30, 2024 are funds deposited by the Government of Puerto Rico, 

municipalities and government &#160;

instrumentalities and corporations. P.R &#160;

public sector deposit &#160;

costs are indexed &#160;

to changes in &#160;

short-

term market &#160;

rates with &#160;

a one-quarter lag, &#160;

in accordance with &#160;

contractual terms. &#160;

During the second &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2024, approximately 

$800 million of low-cost government-related accounts &#160;

managed by our fiduciary services group were &#160;

repriced to market-linked rates. 

Fluctuations of public sector deposit balances are uncertain &#160;

and difficult to predict. Factors that could impact these &#160;

balances include, 

but are not limited to, the receipt &#160;

of funds by the Puerto Rico Government from federal &#160;

disaster funding assistance (i.e. hurricane or 

pandemic related funds) and other events such as seasonal tax collections, actions resulting &#160;

from changes in the financial condition, 

liquidity &#160;

and &#160;

cash &#160;

management practices &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

Government and &#160;

its &#160;

instrumentalities, and/or &#160;

the &#160;

implementation of 

fiscal &#160;

and &#160;

debt &#160;

adjustment &#160;

plans &#160;

approved &#160;

pursuant &#160;

to &#160;

PROMESA &#160;

or &#160;

other &#160;

actions &#160;

mandated &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Fiscal &#160;

Oversight &#160;

and 

Management &#160;

Board &#160;

for &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

(the &#160;

&#8220;Oversight &#160;

Board&#8221;). &#160;

These &#160;

deposits &#160;

require &#160;

that &#160;

the &#160;

bank &#160;

pledge &#160;

high &#160;

credit &#160;

quality 

securities as collateral; therefore, liquidity risks arising &#160;

from deposit outflows are lower. 

The volume and cost of public deposits at BPPR and the proportion of high-cost deposits in the U.S, directly impact the balance and 

mix of earning assets and therefore represent a &#160;

key factor in the Corporation&#8217;s ability to expand its &#160;

net interest margin. &#160;

CAPITAL 

Regulatory Capital 

The Corporation, BPPR and PB &#160;

are subject to regulatory capital &#160;

requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board. &#160;

the capital benefit &#160;

provided during the &#160;

initial two-year delay. &#160;

As of September &#160;

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Market / Interest Rate Risk 

The financial results and capital levels of the &#160;

Corporation are constantly exposed to market, interest &#160;

rate and liquidity risks. 

Market risk &#160;

refers to the &#160;

risk of a &#160;

reduction in the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s capital due &#160;

to changes in &#160;

the market valuation &#160;

of its assets &#160;

and/or 

liabilities. &#160;

Most of the assets &#160;

subject to market valuation risk &#160;

are debt securities classified as &#160;

available-for-sale. Refer to Notes 5 &#160;

and 6 to the 

Consolidated Financial &#160;

Statements for &#160;

further information &#160;

on the &#160;

debt &#160;

securities available-for-sale &#160;

and &#160;

held-to-maturity portfolios. 

Debt &#160;

securities &#160;

classified &#160;

as &#160;

available-for-sale &#160;

and &#160;

held-for-sale &#160;

amounted &#160;

to &#160;

$17.2 &#160;

billion &#160;

and &#160;

$7.9 &#160;

billion, &#160;

respectively, &#160;

as &#160;

of 

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2024. &#160;

Other &#160;

assets &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

market &#160;

risk &#160;

include &#160;

loans &#160;

held-for-sale, &#160;

which &#160;

amounted &#160;

to &#160;

$6 &#160;

million, &#160;

mortgage 

servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;) which amounted to $109 &#160;

million, and securities classified as &#8220;trading&#8221;, which &#160;

amounted to $31 million, as of 

September 30, 2024. &#160;

Interest Rate Risk (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) 

The Corporation&#8217;s net interest income is subject &#160;

to various categories of interest rate risk, &#160;

including repricing, basis, yield curve and 

option risks. &#160;

In managing &#160;

interest rate &#160;

risk, management may &#160;

alter the &#160;

mix of &#160;

floating and &#160;

fixed rate &#160;

assets and &#160;

liabilities, change 

pricing &#160;

schedules, &#160;

adjust &#160;

maturities &#160;

through &#160;

sales &#160;

and &#160;

purchases &#160;

of &#160;

investment &#160;

securities, &#160;

and &#160;

enter &#160;

into &#160;

derivative &#160;

contracts, 

among other alternatives. &#160;

Interest &#160;

rate &#160;

risk &#160;

management &#160;

is &#160;

an &#160;

active &#160;

process &#160;

that &#160;

encompasses &#160;

monitoring &#160;

loan &#160;

and &#160;

deposit &#160;

flows &#160;

complemented &#160;

by 

investment and funding &#160;

activities. Effective management of &#160;

interest rate risk begins &#160;

with understanding the dynamic &#160;

characteristics 

of assets and &#160;

liabilities and determining the &#160;

appropriate rate risk position &#160;

given line of &#160;

business forecasts, management objectives, 

market expectations and policy constraints. 

Management utilizes various tools to assess IRR, including Net Interest &#160;

Income (&#8220;NII&#8221;) simulation modeling, static gap analysis, and 

Economic Value &#160;

of Equity &#160;

(&#8220;EVE&#8221;). The &#160;

three methodologies &#160;

complement each &#160;

other and &#160;

are used &#160;

jointly in &#160;

the evaluation &#160;

of the 

Corporation&#8217;s IRR. NII &#160;

simulation modeling is &#160;

prepared for a &#160;

five-year period, which &#160;

in conjunction with &#160;

the EVE analysis, &#160;

provides 

management a better view of long-term IRR. 

Net interest &#160;

income simulation analysis &#160;

performed by legal &#160;

entity and on &#160;

a consolidated basis &#160;

is a &#160;

tool used &#160;

by the &#160;

Corporation in 

estimating the &#160;

potential change &#160;

in net &#160;

interest income &#160;

resulting from &#160;

hypothetical changes &#160;

in interest &#160;

rates. Sensitivity &#160;

analysis is 

calculated using a simulation model which incorporates &#160;

actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity &#160;

and interest yields or costs. &#160;

Management assesses &#160;

interest rate &#160;

risk by &#160;

comparing various &#160;

NII simulations &#160;

under different &#160;

interest rate &#160;

scenarios that &#160;

differ in 

direction of interest &#160;

rate changes, the &#160;

degree of change &#160;

and the projected &#160;

shape of the &#160;

yield curve. For &#160;

example, the types &#160;

of rate 

scenarios processed during the &#160;

quarter include flat rates, &#160;

implied forwards, and parallel &#160;

and non-parallel rate shocks. &#160;

Management 

also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis &#160;

and prepayment risk exposures. &#160;

The asset &#160;

and liability &#160;

management group &#160;

performs validation &#160;

procedures on &#160;

various assumptions &#160;

used as &#160;

part of &#160;

the simulation 

analyses as well as validations &#160;

of results on a &#160;

monthly basis. In addition, the &#160;

model and processes used to &#160;

assess IRR are subject 

to independent validations according to the guidelines &#160;

established in the Model Governance and &#160;

Validation policy. 

The Corporation processes NII &#160;

simulations under interest rate &#160;

scenarios in which the &#160;

yield curve is assumed &#160;

to rise and &#160;

decline by 

the same magnitude &#160;

(parallel shifts). The &#160;

rate scenarios considered in &#160;

these market risk &#160;

simulations include instantaneous parallel 

changes of -100, -200, &#160;

+100, and +200 basis points &#160;

during the succeeding twelve-month period. Simulation analyses &#160;

are based on 

many assumptions, &#160;

including that &#160;

the balance &#160;

sheet remains &#160;

flat, the &#160;

relative levels &#160;

of market &#160;

interest rates &#160;

across all &#160;

yield curve 

points &#160;

and &#160;

indexes, &#160;

interest &#160;

rate &#160;

spreads, &#160;

loan &#160;

prepayments &#160;

and &#160;

deposit &#160;

elasticity. &#160;

Thus, &#160;

they &#160;

should &#160;

not &#160;

be &#160;

relied &#160;

upon &#160;

as 

indicative of actual results. Further, the estimates do not &#160;

contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in 

interest rates. Additionally, the Corporation is also subject to basis risk in the repricing of its assets and liabilities, including the basis 

related to &#160;

using different &#160;

rate indexes &#160;

for the &#160;

repricing of &#160;

assets and &#160;

liabilities, as &#160;

well as &#160;

the effect &#160;

of pricing &#160;

lags which &#160;

may be 

contractual &#160;

or &#160;

due to &#160;

historical differences &#160;

in the &#160;

timing &#160;

of &#160;

management responses &#160;

to &#160;

changes in &#160;

the rate &#160;

environment. By &#160;

their 

nature, these forward-looking computations are only estimates and may be different from &#160;

what may actually occur in the future. The 

following table &#160;

results of &#160;

the &#160;

maintains &#160;

an &#160;

asset &#160;

sensitive &#160;

position &#160;

that &#160;

is &#160;

slightly &#160;

more 

pronounced in the rising rates scenarios and closer to neutral &#160;

in the declining scenarios as compared to the results as &#160;

of December 

31, &#160;

2023. &#160;

The &#160;

primary &#160;

reasons &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

variation &#160;

in &#160;

sensitivity &#160;

are &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

balance &#160;

sheet &#160;

composition &#160;

primarily &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

an 

increase in short-term U.S Treasury &#160;

Bills (&#8220;T- &#160;

Bills&#8221;) as well as &#160;

higher loan balances, partially offset &#160;

by an increase in market-linked 

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

public &#160;

sector &#160;

deposits &#160;

and &#160;

a &#160;

reduction &#160;

in &#160;

overnight &#160;

Fed &#160;

Funds. &#160;

These &#160;

results &#160;

suggest &#160;

that &#160;

fluctuations &#160;

in &#160;

the 

Corporation&#8217;s net interest income sensitivity are primarily driven by changes in the composition of the investment portfolio as well as 

the &#160;

level &#160;

of &#160;

loan &#160;

balances. &#160;

During &#160;

the &#160;

quarter &#160;

ended &#160;

on &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2024, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

began &#160;

to &#160;

reinvest &#160;

some &#160;

of &#160;

the 

proceeds of the &#160;

maturing portfolio into U.S &#160;

Treasury Notes with &#160;

average maturities between 2 &#160;

to 3 years. &#160;

Additionally, variations &#160;

in 

liability &#160;

cost, &#160;

primarily &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

public &#160;

sector &#160;

deposits &#160;

that &#160;

represented &#160;

$18.7 &#160;

billion &#160;

or &#160;

29% &#160;

of &#160;

deposits &#160;

as &#160;

of 

September 30, &#160;

2024, as &#160;

well as &#160;

changes in &#160;

the composition &#160;

and mix &#160;

of deposits, &#160;

also &#160;

impact the &#160;

sensitivity profile. &#160;

In the &#160;

more 

extreme declining rate scenarios, net interest income would be affected as the repricing of short-term assets and variable rate loans 

slightly &#160;

exceeds &#160;

the &#160;

benefit &#160;

in &#160;

cost &#160;

reduction &#160;

of &#160;

these &#160;

deposits. &#160;

In &#160;

rising &#160;

rate &#160;

scenarios, &#160;

Popular&#8217;s &#160;

net &#160;

interest &#160;

income &#160;

is &#160;

also 

impacted by its large proportion &#160;

of Puerto Rico public sector &#160;

deposit, however the repricing of assets &#160;

as they either reset &#160;

or mature 

lead to an increase in net interest income. 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

loan and &#160;

investment portfolios &#160;

are subject &#160;

to &#160;

prepayment risk, &#160;

which results &#160;

from the &#160;

ability of &#160;

a third-party &#160;

to 

repay debt &#160;

obligations prior &#160;

to maturity. &#160;

Prepayment risk &#160;

also could &#160;

have a &#160;

significant impact &#160;

on the &#160;

duration of &#160;

mortgage-backed 

securities &#160;

and &#160;

collateralized &#160;

mortgage &#160;

obligations &#160;

since &#160;

prepayments &#160;

could &#160;

shorten &#160;

(or &#160;

lower &#160;

prepayments &#160;

could &#160;

extend) &#160;

the 

weighted average life of these portfolios.

Trading &#160;

The Corporation &#160;

engages in &#160;

trading activities &#160;

in the &#160;

ordinary course &#160;

of business &#160;

at its &#160;

subsidiaries, BPPR &#160;

and Popular &#160;

Securities. 

Popular Securities&#8217; &#160;

trading activities &#160;

consist primarily &#160;

of market-making &#160;

activities to &#160;

meet expected &#160;

customers&#8217; needs &#160;

related to &#160;

its 

retail brokerage business, &#160;

and purchases and sales of U.S. Government and &#160;

government sponsored securities with the objective of 

realizing gains &#160;

from expected &#160;

short-term price &#160;

movements. BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

trading activities consist &#160;

primarily of &#160;

holding U.S. &#160;

Government 

sponsored &#160;

mortgage-backed securities &#160;

classified &#160;

as &#160;

&#8220;trading&#8221; and &#160;

hedging &#160;

the &#160;

related &#160;

market &#160;

risk &#160;

with &#160;

&#8220;TBA&#8221; &#160;

(to-be-announced) 

market &#160;

transactions. &#160;

The &#160;

objective &#160;

is &#160;

to &#160;

derive &#160;

spread &#160;

income &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

portfolio &#160;

and &#160;

not &#160;

to &#160;

benefit &#160;

from &#160;

short-term &#160;

market 

movements. In &#160;

addition, BPPR &#160;

uses forward &#160;

contracts or &#160;

TBAs to &#160;

hedge its &#160;

securitization pipeline. &#160;

Risks related &#160;

to variations &#160;

in 

interest rates &#160;

and market volatility &#160;

are hedged &#160;

with TBAs &#160;

that have &#160;

characteristics similar to &#160;

that of &#160;

the forecasted security &#160;

and its 

conversion timeline. 

At September 30, 2024, the Corporation held trading securities &#160;

with a fair value of $31 million, representing approximately 0.04% &#160;

of 

the Corporation&#8217;s total assets, compared with $32 million and &#160;

0.05%, respectively, at December 31, 2023. As shown in Table 12, the 

trading &#160;

portfolio &#160;

consists &#160;

principally &#160;

of &#160;

mortgage-backed &#160;

securities &#160;

and &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Treasuries, &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s trading activities are limited by internal policies. &#160;

For each of the three subsidiaries, the market risk &#160;

assumed under 

trading &#160;

activities &#160;

is &#160;

measured &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

5-day &#160;

net &#160;

value-at-risk &#160;

(&#8220;VAR&#8221;), &#160;

with &#160;

a &#160;

confidence &#160;

level &#160;

of &#160;

99%. &#160;

The &#160;

VAR &#160;

measures &#160;

the 

maximum estimated loss that may occur over a &#160;

5-day holding period, given a 99% probability. &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s trading portfolio had a 5-day VAR of approximately $0.5 million for the last week in September 2024. &#160;

VAR models 

include &#160;

assumptions and &#160;

estimates thus &#160;

actual &#160;

results could &#160;

differ &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

outputs from &#160;

these &#160;

models &#160;

and &#160;

assumptions. Back-

testing is performed on model &#160;

results to compare actual results &#160;

against maximum estimated losses, in order &#160;

to evaluate model and 

assumptions accuracy. &#160;

In the opinion of management, the size and composition &#160;

of the trading portfolio does not represent &#160;

a significant source of market risk 

for the Corporation. 

Liquidity Sources and Risk 

The &#160;

objective &#160;

of &#160;

effective &#160;

liquidity &#160;

management &#160;

is &#160;

to &#160;

ensure &#160;

that &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

has &#160;

sufficient &#160;

liquidity &#160;

to &#160;

meet &#160;

all &#160;

its &#160;

financial 

obligations, finance &#160;

expected future &#160;

growth, &#160;

fund &#160;

planned capital &#160;

distributions and &#160;

maintain a &#160;

reasonable safety &#160;

margin for &#160;

cash 

needs under &#160;

both normal &#160;

and stressed market &#160;

conditions. The Board &#160;

of Directors &#160;

is responsible &#160;

for establishing the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s 

tolerance for liquidity risk, &#160;

including approving relevant risk limits and &#160;

policies. The Board of &#160;

Directors has delegated the monitoring 

of these risks to the Board&#8217;s Risk Management Committee &#160;

and the Asset/Liability Management Committee. &#160;

An &#160;

institution&#8217;s liquidity &#160;

may be &#160;

pressured if, &#160;

for example, &#160;

it experiences &#160;

a sudden &#160;

and unexpected &#160;

substantial cash &#160;

outflow due 

deposit &#160;

outflows, &#160;

whether due &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

loss &#160;

of confidence &#160;

by &#160;

depositors, or &#160;

other &#160;

reasons, including &#160;

exogenous events &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

the 

COVID-19 pandemic, &#160;

a downgrading &#160;

of its &#160;

credit rating, &#160;

or some &#160;

other event &#160;

that causes &#160;

counterparties to &#160;

avoid exposure &#160;

to the 

institution. Factors &#160;

that the &#160;

Corporation does &#160;

not control, &#160;

such &#160;

as the &#160;

economic outlook, &#160;

adverse ratings &#160;

of its &#160;

principal markets, 

perceptions of the financial services industry and regulatory &#160;

changes, could also affect its ability to obtain &#160;

funding. &#160;

The Corporation &#160;

has adopted &#160;

policies and &#160;

limits to &#160;

monitor the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s liquidity &#160;

position and &#160;

that of &#160;

its banking &#160;

subsidiaries. 

Additionally, &#160;

contingency funding &#160;

plans are &#160;

used to &#160;

model various &#160;

stressful events &#160;

of different &#160;

magnitudes and &#160;

affecting different 

time horizons &#160;

that assist &#160;

management in &#160;

evaluating the size &#160;

of the &#160;

liquidity buffers &#160;

needed if &#160;

those stress &#160;

events occur. &#160;

However, 

such models &#160;

may not &#160;

predict accurately &#160;

how the &#160;

market and &#160;

customers might &#160;

react to &#160;

every event &#160;

and are &#160;

dependent on &#160;

many 

assumptions. 

Deposits, including &#160;

customer deposits, &#160;

brokered deposits &#160;

and public &#160;

funds deposits, &#160;

continue to &#160;

be the &#160;

most significant &#160;

source of 

funds for &#160;

the Corporation, &#160;

funding 89% &#160;

of the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s total &#160;

assets at &#160;

The &#160;

ratio &#160;

of &#160;

total &#160;

In &#160;

addition &#160;

to

arrangements, which amounted to approximately &#160;

$1.0 billion in outstanding 

balances &#160;

at &#160;

A &#160;

detailed &#160;

description &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

borrowings, 

including their terms, &#160;

is included in &#160;

Note 15 &#160;

Consolidated Financial Statements. &#160;

Also, the &#160;

Consolidated Statements of &#160;

Cash 

Flows in the accompanying Consolidated Financial &#160;

Statements provide information on the Corporation&#8217;s cash &#160;

inflows and outflows. &#160;

&#160;

The importance of &#160;

the Puerto Rico &#160;

market for the &#160;

Corporation is an &#160;

additional risk factor &#160;

that could affect &#160;

its financing activities. &#160;

In 

the case &#160;

of a &#160;

deterioration in &#160;

the outlook &#160;

and/or credit &#160;

ratings of &#160;

its principal &#160;

markets and/or &#160;

due to &#160;

regulatory changes &#160;

and fiscal 

conditions in &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

that are &#160;

outside the &#160;

control of &#160;

the Corporation, &#160;

the credit &#160;

quality of &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

could be &#160;

adversely 

affected and result in higher credit costs. These adverse &#160;

events could also affect the Corporation&#8217;s ability to obtain &#160;

funding. 

To &#160;

plan for the possibility of &#160;

such a scenario, management adopted contingency &#160;

plans to address events that could &#160;

limit or partially 

limit important &#160;

sources of &#160;

funds that &#160;

are usually &#160;

fully available &#160;

for use. &#160;

These plans &#160;

call for &#160;

using alternate &#160;

funding mechanisms, 

such as the &#160;

pledging of certain &#160;

asset classes and accessing &#160;

secured credit lines &#160;

and loan facilities &#160;

put in place &#160;

with the FHLB &#160;

and 

the &#160;

FRB. The &#160;

Corporation is &#160;

subject to &#160;

positive tangible &#160;

capital &#160;

requirements to &#160;

limitation &#160;

of &#160;

or &#160;

even &#160;

if &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

well-capitalized &#160;

regulatory 

capital levels. &#160;

The credit &#160;

ratings of &#160;

Popular&#8217;s debt &#160;

obligations are &#160;

a relevant &#160;

factor for &#160;

liquidity because &#160;

they impact &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

ability to 

borrow &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

capital &#160;

markets, &#160;

its &#160;

cost &#160;

and &#160;

access &#160;

to &#160;

funding &#160;

sources. &#160;

Credit &#160;

ratings &#160;

are &#160;

based &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

financial &#160;

strength, &#160;

credit 

quality and &#160;

concentrations in &#160;

the loan &#160;

portfolio, the &#160;

level and &#160;

volatility of &#160;

earnings, capital &#160;

adequacy, &#160;

the quality &#160;

of management, 

geographic concentration &#160;

in Puerto &#160;

Rico, the &#160;

liquidity of &#160;

the balance &#160;

sheet, the &#160;

availability of &#160;

a significant &#160;

base of &#160;

core retail &#160;

and 

commercial deposits, and the Corporation&#8217;s ability to access &#160;

a broad array of wholesale funding sources, &#160;

among other factors. &#160;

Furthermore, &#160;

various &#160;

statutory &#160;

provisions &#160;

limit &#160;

the &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

dividends &#160;

an &#160;

insured &#160;

depository &#160;

institution &#160;

may &#160;

pay &#160;

to &#160;

its &#160;

holding 

company without &#160;

regulatory approval. A &#160;

member bank must &#160;

obtain the &#160;

approval of &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve Board &#160;

for any &#160;

dividend, if 

the total of all dividends declared by the member &#160;

bank during the calendar year would exceed &#160;

the combined net income for that year 

and the retained net income for &#160;

the preceding two years, net of &#160;

those years&#8217; dividend activity, &#160;

less any required transfers to surplus 

or to a &#160;

fund for the &#160;

retirement of any &#160;

preferred stock. In &#160;

addition, a member &#160;

bank may not &#160;

declare or pay &#160;

a dividend in &#160;

an amount 

greater &#160;

than &#160;

its &#160;

undivided &#160;

profits &#160;

as &#160;

reported &#160;

in &#160;

its &#160;

Report &#160;

of &#160;

Condition and &#160;

Income, &#160;

unless &#160;

the &#160;

member &#160;

bank &#160;

has &#160;

received &#160;

the 

approval of &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve Board. A &#160;

member bank also &#160;

may not permit &#160;

any portion of &#160;

its permanent capital &#160;

to be &#160;

withdrawn 

unless the withdrawal has been approved by &#160;

the Federal Reserve Board. The ability of &#160;

a bank subsidiary to up-stream dividends to 

its BHC &#160;

could thus &#160;

be impacted &#160;

by its &#160;

financial performance &#160;

and capital, &#160;

including tangible &#160;

and regulatory &#160;

capital, thus &#160;

potentially 

limiting the &#160;

amount of &#160;

cash moving &#160;

up to &#160;

the BHCs &#160;

from &#160;

the banking &#160;

subsidiaries. This &#160;

could, &#160;

in turn, &#160;

affect &#160;

the BHCs &#160;

ability to 

declare &#160;

dividends &#160;

on &#160;

its &#160;

outstanding &#160;

common &#160;

and &#160;

preferred &#160;

stock, &#160;

repurchase &#160;

its &#160;

securities &#160;

or &#160;

meet &#160;

its &#160;

debt &#160;

obligations, &#160;

for 

example.

(BPPR and &#160;

PB &#160;

or, &#160;

collectively, &#160;

securitization and, to a lesser extent, loan sales. &#160;

Refer to Table 8 in this MD&#38;A section for a breakdown of deposits by major types. Core deposits are generated &#160;

from a large base of 

consumer, corporate and &#160;

public sector customers. Core deposits &#160;

include certificates of deposit &#160;

under $250,000, all interest-bearing 

transactional deposit accounts, &#160;

non-interest bearing deposits, &#160;

and savings deposits. &#160;

Core deposits exclude &#160;

brokered deposits and 

certificates &#160;

of &#160;

deposit &#160;

over &#160;

$250,000. &#160;

Core &#160;

P.R. &#160;

public &#160;

funds &#160;

that &#160;

are &#160;

fully &#160;

collateralized, &#160;

have &#160;

historically 

provided the Corporation &#160;

with a sizable source &#160;

of low-cost funds. P.R. &#160;

public funds, while &#160;

linked to market &#160;

interest rates, provide &#160;

a 

stable source of funding &#160;

with attractive earnings spread. Core &#160;

deposits totaled $60.3 billion, or &#160;

95% of total deposits, &#160;

at September 

30, &#160;

2024, &#160;

compared &#160;

with &#160;

$59.0 &#160;

89% &#160;

of &#160;

the 

Corporation&#8217;s earning assets at September 30, 2024, compared &#160;

with 88% at December 31, 2023. 

In addition, the Corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the FHLB and at the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank of 

New York (the &#8220;FRB&#8221;) and has a considerable amount of collateral pledged &#160;

that can be used to raise funds under these &#160;

facilities. &#160;

During the third quarter of 2024 the &#160;

Corporation had no material incremental use of its &#160;

available liquidity sources. At September 30, 

2024, the Corporation&#8217;s available liquidity increased to &#160;

$ 20.5 billion from $19.5 billion &#160;

on December 31, 2023. The liquidity sources 

of the Corporation at September 30, 2024 are &#160;

information &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

borrowing &#160;

facilities 

available through its banking subsidiaries. &#160;

The principal &#160;

uses of &#160;

funds for &#160;

the banking &#160;

subsidiaries include &#160;

loan originations, &#160;

investment portfolio &#160;

purchases, loan &#160;

purchases 

and repurchases, repayment of outstanding obligations (including deposits), advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational 

expenses. Also, the &#160;

banking subsidiaries assume liquidity &#160;

risk related to collateral &#160;

posting requirements for certain &#160;

activities mainly 

in &#160;

connection &#160;

with &#160;

contractual &#160;

commitments, &#160;

recourse &#160;

provisions, &#160;

servicing &#160;

advances, &#160;

derivatives &#160;

and &#160;

credit &#160;

card &#160;

licensing 

agreements. &#160;

The banking &#160;

subsidiaries maintain &#160;

sufficient funding &#160;

capacity to &#160;

address large &#160;

increases in &#160;

funding requirements &#160;

such as &#160;

deposit 

outflows. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation has &#160;

established &#160;

liquidity &#160;

guidelines &#160;

that &#160;

require &#160;

the &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

to &#160;

have &#160;

sufficient &#160;

liquidity &#160;

to 

cover all short-term borrowings and a portion of deposits. &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s ability to compete &#160;

successfully in the marketplace for &#160;

deposits, excluding brokered deposits, depends on various 

factors, including pricing, service, convenience &#160;

and financial stability as &#160;

reflected by operating results and &#160;

financial condition, credit 

ratings (by &#160;

nationally recognized credit &#160;

rating agencies), customer &#160;

confidence, and &#160;

importantly, &#160;

FDIC deposit &#160;

insurance coverage. 

Deposits at all of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries are federally insured &#160;

(subject to FDIC limits) and this is expected to mitigate 

the potential effect of the aforementioned risks. 

The distribution by maturity &#160;

of certificates of deposit &#160;

with denominations of $250,000 &#160;

and over at September &#160;

30, 2024 is &#160;

presented 

in the table that follows:

The Corporation had &#160;

$1.7 billion in &#160;

brokered deposits at September &#160;

30, 2024, which &#160;

financed approximately &#160;

2% of its &#160;

total assets 

(December 31, 2023 - &#160;

$1.7 billion and 2%, &#160;

respectively). &#160;

In the event that &#160;

any of the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

banking subsidiaries&#8217; regulatory 

capital &#160;

ratios fall &#160;

below those &#160;

required by &#160;

a &#160;

well-capitalized institution &#160;

or &#160;

are &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

capital &#160;

restrictions by &#160;

the &#160;

regulators, the 

Corporation would be &#160;

at risk that &#160;

such banking subsidiary &#160;

would not be &#160;

able to raise &#160;

or maintain brokered deposits &#160;

and could also 

face limitations &#160;

on the &#160;

rate paid &#160;

on deposits, &#160;

which may &#160;

hinder the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s ability &#160;

to effectively &#160;

compete in &#160;

its retail &#160;

markets 

and could affect its deposit raising efforts. &#160;

Deposits from the public sector &#160;

represent an important source of &#160;

funds for the Corporation. &#160;

As of September 30, &#160;

2024, total Puerto 

Rico &#160;

public sector &#160;

deposits were &#160;

$18.7 billion, &#160;

compared to &#160;

$18.1 billion &#160;

at December &#160;

31, 2023. &#160;

These deposits &#160;

require that &#160;

the 

&#160;

&#160;

bank pledges &#160;

high credit quality securities as collateral; &#160;

therefore, liquidity risks arising from public sector deposit outflows are lower 

given &#160;

that &#160;

the &#160;

bank &#160;

receives &#160;

its &#160;

collateral &#160;

in &#160;

return. &#160;

This, &#160;

now &#160;

unpledged, &#160;

collateral &#160;

can &#160;

either &#160;

be &#160;

financed &#160;

via &#160;

repurchase 

agreements &#160;

or &#160;

sold &#160;

for &#160;

cash. &#160;

However, &#160;

timing &#160;

differences &#160;

between the &#160;

time &#160;

the &#160;

deposit &#160;

outflow and &#160;

when the &#160;

bank &#160;

receives &#160;

its 

collateral may occur. Additionally, &#160;

the Corporation uses fixed-rate U.S. Treasury &#160;

debt securities as collateral that have limited &#160;

credit 

risk, &#160;

but &#160;

are &#160;

nonetheless &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

market &#160;

value &#160;

risk &#160;

based &#160;

on &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

interest &#160;

rate &#160;

environment. &#160;

When &#160;

interest &#160;

rates 

increase, the value of this collateral decreases and could result in the Corporation having to provide additional collateral to cover the 

same &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

deposit &#160;

liabilities. &#160;

This &#160;

additional &#160;

collateral &#160;

could &#160;

reduce &#160;

unpledged &#160;

securities &#160;

otherwise &#160;

available &#160;

as &#160;

liquidity 

sources to the Corporation. &#160;

As of September 30, 2024, management believes that the banking subsidiaries had sufficient current and projected liquidity sources 

to meet their anticipated cash flow &#160;

obligations, as well as special &#160;

needs and off-balance sheet commitments, in the &#160;

ordinary course 

of business. &#160;

Management also believes that &#160;

as of September &#160;

30, 2024 its &#160;

banking subsidiaries have sufficient &#160;

liquidity current and 

projected &#160;

resources to &#160;

address an &#160;

event &#160;

that &#160;

would stress &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s liquidity &#160;

position. Although &#160;

the &#160;

banking subsidiaries 

have &#160;

historically &#160;

been &#160;

able &#160;

to &#160;

replace &#160;

maturing &#160;

deposits &#160;

and &#160;

advances, &#160;

no &#160;

assurance can &#160;

be &#160;

given &#160;

that &#160;

they &#160;

would &#160;

be &#160;

able &#160;

to 

replace &#160;

those &#160;

funds &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

future &#160;

if &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

financial &#160;

condition &#160;

or &#160;

general &#160;

market &#160;

conditions &#160;

were &#160;

to &#160;

deteriorate. &#160;

The 

Corporation&#8217;s financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the banking &#160;

subsidiaries are unable to maintain access to funding or if 

adequate financing is not &#160;

available to accommodate future financing &#160;

needs at acceptable interest &#160;

rates. The Corporation&#8217;s banking 

subsidiaries have to &#160;

meet margin requirements &#160;

on repurchase agreements &#160;

and other collateralized &#160;

borrowing facilities that &#160;

include 

certain required &#160;

levels of &#160;

cash deposits &#160;

and qualifying &#160;

securities. To &#160;

the extent &#160;

that the &#160;

value of &#160;

securities previously &#160;

pledged as 

collateral declines below such required &#160;

amounts because of market changes, the &#160;

Corporation is required to deposit additional &#160;

cash 

or securities &#160;

to meet &#160;

its margin &#160;

requirements, thereby &#160;

adversely affecting &#160;

its liquidity. &#160;

Finally, &#160;

to the &#160;

extent the &#160;

Corporation relies 

more heavily on more &#160;

expensive funding sources in order &#160;

to meet its future &#160;

growth, revenues may not &#160;

increase in a manner &#160;

that is 

proportionate to cover these costs. In this case, the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

profitability would be adversely effected. 

The Corporation &#160;

monitors uninsured &#160;

deposits under &#160;

applicable FDIC &#160;

regulations. &#160;

Additionally, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

monitors accounts 

with balances over $250,000. &#160;

While the Corporation has a &#160;

diverse deposit base from retail, commercial, &#160;

corporate and government 

clients, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

including 

collateralized public funds and deposits outside of the &#160;

U.S. and its territories. &#160;

Collateralized public funds, as presented in Table &#160;

Bank Holding Companies 

The principal &#160;

sources of &#160;

funding for &#160;

the BHCs, &#160;

which are &#160;

Popular, &#160;

Inc. &#160;

(holding company &#160;

and &#160;

asset sales, &#160;

credit &#160;

facilities &#160;

available from 

affiliate banking subsidiaries and proceeds from potential securities offerings. &#160;

Dividends from banking and non-banking subsidiaries 

are subject to various regulatory limits &#160;

and authorization requirements that are further described &#160;

below and that may limit the &#160;

ability 

of those subsidiaries to act as a source of &#160;

funding to the BHCs. 

The &#160;

principal &#160;

uses &#160;

of &#160;

these &#160;

funds &#160;

stockholders, 

repurchases of the Corporation&#8217;s securities and capitalizing its &#160;

banking subsidiaries. &#160;

On &#160;

July &#160;

24, &#160;

2024, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

announced &#160;

the &#160;

authorization &#160;

for &#160;

a &#160;

common &#160;

stock &#160;

repurchase &#160;

of &#160;

up &#160;

to &#160;

$500 &#160;

million. &#160;

The 

Corporation&#8217;s planned common stock repurchases may &#160;

be executed in open market &#160;

transactions, privately negotiated transactions, 

block trades or any other manner determined &#160;

by the Corporation. The timing, quantity and price of &#160;

such repurchases will be subject 

to &#160;

various factors, &#160;

including market &#160;

conditions, the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s capital &#160;

position and &#160;

financial performance, &#160;

the capital &#160;

impact of 

strategic initiatives and regulatory and tax considerations. The common stock repurchase program does not &#160;

require the Corporation 

to acquire &#160;

a specific &#160;

dollar amount &#160;

or number &#160;

of shares &#160;

and may &#160;

be modified, &#160;

suspended or &#160;

terminated at &#160;

any time &#160;

without prior 

notice. During &#160;

the quarter &#160;

ended September &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

completed the &#160;

repurchase of &#160;

599,096 shares &#160;

of common 

stock &#160;

for &#160;

$58.8 million &#160;

at &#160;

an average &#160;

price &#160;

of &#160;

$98.11 &#160;

previously announced &#160;

$500 million &#160;

As of &#160;

September 30, &#160;

2024, the &#160;

BHCs had &#160;

cash and &#160;

money markets &#160;

investments totaling &#160;

$689 million &#160;

and borrowing &#160;

potential of 

$165 million from its secured facility with BPPR. &#160;

The BHCs&#8217; &#160;

liquidity position continues to be adequate with sufficient cash &#160;

on hand, 

investments and &#160;

other sources of &#160;

liquidity that are &#160;

expected to be &#160;

sufficient to &#160;

meet all &#160;

interest payments and &#160;

dividend obligations 

for the foreseeable future. &#160;

Additionally, the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

latest quarterly dividend was $0.62 per share &#160;

or approximately $45 million 

per quarter. 

The BHCs have in &#160;

the past borrowed in the &#160;

corporate debt market primarily to finance &#160;

their non-banking subsidiaries and refinance 

debt obligations. The issuance of corporate debt as &#160;

a source of funding is likely more &#160;

costly due to the fact that &#160;

two out of the three 

principal credit &#160;

rating agencies &#160;

rate the &#160;

Corporation below &#160;

&#8220;investment grade&#8221;, &#160;

which affects &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

cost &#160;

and ability &#160;

to 

raise &#160;

funds &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

capital &#160;

markets. &#160;

that &#160;

the &#160;

economic &#160;

outlook, &#160;

interest &#160;

rate 

volatility, &#160;

inflation, disruptions in &#160;

the debt market, &#160;

among others, could &#160;

also affect &#160;

its ability to &#160;

obtain funding. The &#160;

sources &#160;

operations, &#160;

loan 

sales, repurchase agreements, capital &#160;

injections and borrowed funds &#160;

from their direct &#160;

parent companies or the &#160;

holding companies. 

The principal uses of funds for the non-banking &#160;

subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt, &#160;

operational expenses and payment 

of dividends to the &#160;

BHCs. The liquidity needs &#160;

of the non-banking subsidiaries &#160;

are minimal since most &#160;

of them are &#160;

funded internally 

from operating &#160;

cash flows &#160;

On July 24, 2024, the corporation announced an increase in the Corporation&#8217;s quarterly common stock dividend from $0.62 to $0.70

Other Funding Sources and Capital 

In addition to cash reserves held at the FRB that totaled $ 6.5 billion &#160;

to &#160;

discussed in 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Table &#160;

13. A substantial portion of these &#160;

debt securities could be used to raise &#160;

financing in the U.S. money markets &#160;

or from secured 

lending sources, &#160;

subject to changes in their fair market value and customary adjustments &#160;

(haircuts). &#160;

Additional liquidity may &#160;

be provided through &#160;

loan maturities, prepayments &#160;

and sales. The &#160;

loan portfolio can &#160;

also be used &#160;

to obtain 

funding in the capital &#160;

markets. Mortgage loans and some &#160;

types of consumer loans, &#160;

have secondary markets which the &#160;

Corporation 

could use. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments 

In the ordinary course &#160;

of business, the Corporation &#160;

engages in financial transactions that &#160;

are not recorded on &#160;

the balance sheet or 

may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different than the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. As a 

provider of &#160;

financial services, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

routinely enters &#160;

into commitments &#160;

with off-balance &#160;

sheet risk &#160;

to meet &#160;

the financial 

needs of &#160;

its customers. These &#160;

commitments may include &#160;

loan commitments and &#160;

standby letters of &#160;

credit. These commitments &#160;

are 

subject &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

same &#160;

credit &#160;

policies &#160;

and &#160;

approval &#160;

process &#160;

used &#160;

for &#160;

on-balance &#160;

sheet &#160;

instruments. &#160;

These &#160;

instruments &#160;

involve, &#160;

to 

varying degrees, elements &#160;

of credit and &#160;

interest rate risk &#160;

in excess of &#160;

the amount recognized &#160;

in the statement &#160;

of financial position.

of &#160;

the &#160;

systemic &#160;

risk &#160;

exception. In &#160;

connection with &#160;

this assessment, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation recorded &#160;

an &#160;

expense of &#160;

$71.4 

million, $45.3 million net of tax, &#160;

in the fourth quarter of 2023, &#160;

representing the full amount of the &#160;

estimated assessment at that time. 

The &#160;

special &#160;

assessment &#160;

amount &#160;

and &#160;

collection &#160;

period &#160;

may &#160;

change &#160;

as &#160;

the &#160;

estimated &#160;

loss &#160;

is &#160;

periodically &#160;

adjusted &#160;

or &#160;

if &#160;

the &#160;

total 

amount collected varies. As &#160;

a result, the Corporation &#160;

recorded an additional expense &#160;

of $14.3 million, $9.1 &#160;

million net of tax, &#160;

in the 

first quarter of 2024, based on the updated &#160;

loss estimates.

Operations table &#160;

above, during &#160;

of the Federal &#160;

the 

New York State Department of Financial Services. 

The Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries have historically not &#160;

used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance &#160;

its operations, and 

therefore are less sensitive to the level and &#160;

changes in the Corporation&#8217;s overall credit ratings. 

Refer to the &#160;

Geographic and Government Risk section &#160;

of this MD&#38;A for &#160;

some highlights on the &#160;

status of the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy 

and the ongoing fiscal crisis. 

Obligations Subject to Rating Triggers or Collateral Requirements 

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

currently &#160;

do &#160;

not &#160;

issue &#160;

unsecured &#160;

senior &#160;

debt, &#160;

as &#160;

these &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

are &#160;

funded 

primarily with &#160;

deposits and secured &#160;

borrowings. The banking &#160;

subsidiaries had &#160;

$6.6 million in &#160;

deposits at &#160;

September 30, 2024 &#160;

that 

are subject to rating triggers. &#160;

In addition, &#160;

certain mortgage servicing &#160;

and custodial agreements &#160;

that BPPR &#160;

has with &#160;

third parties &#160;

include rating covenants. &#160;

In the 

event of a credit rating downgrade, the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for 

escrow deposits and/or increase collateral levels &#160;

securing the recourse obligations. &#160;

As discussed &#160;

in Note &#160;

19 to &#160;

the Consolidated Financial &#160;

Statements, the Corporation &#160;

services residential mortgage &#160;

loans subject &#160;

to 

credit &#160;

recourse &#160;

provisions. &#160;

Certain &#160;

contractual &#160;

agreements &#160;

require &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

to &#160;

post &#160;

collateral &#160;

to &#160;

secure &#160;

such &#160;

recourse 

obligations if &#160;

the institution&#8217;s &#160;

required credit &#160;

ratings are &#160;

not maintained. &#160;

Collateral pledged &#160;

by the &#160;

Corporation to &#160;

secure recourse 

obligations amounted &#160;

to approximately &#160;

$25.7 million &#160;

at September 30, &#160;

2024. The &#160;

Corporation could be &#160;

required to &#160;

post additional 

collateral under the &#160;

agreements. Management expects that &#160;

it would be &#160;

able to meet &#160;

additional collateral requirements if &#160;

and when 

needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the Corporation&#8217;s 

liquidity resources and impact its operating results.

Credit Risk 

Geographic and Government Risk &#160;

The Corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk. &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s assets and revenue composition by geographical 

area and by business segment reporting are presented &#160;

in Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 

A &#160;

significant portion &#160;

of &#160;

our financial &#160;

activities and &#160;

credit &#160;

exposure is &#160;

concentrated in &#160;

the &#160;

Commonwealth of &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

(&#8220;Puerto 

Rico&#8221;), which has faced severe economic and fiscal &#160;

challenges in the past and may face additional &#160;

challenges in the future. &#160;

Economic Performance. &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico&#8217;s &#160;

economy suffered &#160;

a &#160;

severe and &#160;

prolonged recession &#160;

from &#160;

2007 &#160;

to &#160;

2017, &#160;

with real &#160;

gross national &#160;

product (&#8220;GNP&#8221;) 

contracting approximately 15% &#160;

during this period. &#160;

In 2017, Hurricane &#160;

Mar&#237;a caused significant &#160;

damage and destruction &#160;

across the 

island, resulting in further economic contraction. Puerto Rico&#8217;s &#160;

economy has been gradually recovering since 2018, in &#160;

part aided by 

the large amount &#160;

of federal disaster &#160;

relief and recovery &#160;

assistance funds injected &#160;

into the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy in &#160;

connection with 

Hurricane Mar&#237;a &#160;

and other &#160;

recent natural &#160;

disasters. This &#160;

growth was &#160;

interrupted by &#160;

the economic &#160;

shock caused &#160;

by the &#160;

COVID-19 

pandemic in 2020, but has since resumed, in part &#160;

aided by additional federal assistance from &#160;

pandemic-related stimulus measures.

Economic 

Activity Index &#160;

is a &#160;

coincident indicator &#160;

of &#160;

ongoing economic &#160;

activity but &#160;

not a &#160;

direct measurement &#160;

of &#160;

real GNP. &#160;

The Puerto &#160;

Rico 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Planning Board estimates that Puerto Rico&#8217;s &#160;

real GNP grew 2.8% during fiscal &#160;

year 2024 (July 2023-June 2024) and &#160;

projects 1.4% 

real GNP growth for fiscal year 2025 &#160;

(July 2024-June 2025). 

While the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

economy has &#160;

not directly &#160;

tracked the &#160;

United States &#160;

economy in &#160;

recent years, &#160;

many of &#160;

the external &#160;

factors 

that impact &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy &#160;

are affected &#160;

by the &#160;

policies and performance &#160;

of the &#160;

United States &#160;

economy. &#160;

These external 

factors include the level &#160;

of interest rates and &#160;

the rate of &#160;

inflation. In 2021 and &#160;

2022, inflation rose sharply &#160;

in both the &#160;

United States 

and Puerto &#160;

Rico as &#160;

the economy &#160;

reopened following &#160;

the COVID-19 &#160;

pandemic and &#160;

demand surged &#160;

beyond what &#160;

disrupted supply 

chains could meet. &#160;

After peaking in &#160;

mid-2022, inflation rates &#160;

gradually decreased as the &#160;

Federal Reserve implemented &#160;

a series of 

benchmark interest &#160;

rate increases. &#160;

By September &#160;

2024, inflation &#160;

had largely &#160;

stabilized, prompting &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve to &#160;

reduce 

interest rates for the first time &#160;

in four years. As of &#160;

September 2024, the United States Consumer Price Index &#160;

(published by the U.S. 

Bureau &#160;

of &#160;

Labor Statistics) &#160;

reflects &#160;

a &#160;

year-over-year increase &#160;

of &#160;

2.4%. Meanwhile, &#160;

inflation &#160;

in &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico, &#160;

as &#160;

measured &#160;

by &#160;

the 

Puerto Rico Consumer Price &#160;

Fiscal Challenges. &#160;

As the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

economy contracted, the &#160;

government&#8217;s public &#160;

debt rose &#160;

rapidly, &#160;

in part &#160;

from borrowing to &#160;

cover deficits &#160;

to pay 

debt service, &#160;

pension benefits and &#160;

other government expenditures. &#160;

By 2016, &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico government had &#160;

over $120 &#160;

billion in 

combined debt and unfunded pension liabilities, had &#160;

lost access to the capital markets, and was in &#160;

the midst of a fiscal crisis. 

Puerto &#160;

Rico&#8217;s &#160;

escalating fiscal &#160;

and economic &#160;

challenges &#160;

and imminent &#160;

widespread defaults &#160;

in &#160;

its &#160;

public debt &#160;

prompted the &#160;

U.S. 

Congress to &#160;

enact the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

Oversight, Management, &#160;

and Economic &#160;

Stability Act &#160;

(&#8220;PROMESA&#8221;) in &#160;

June 2016. &#160;

PROMESA 

created the &#8220;Oversight Board&#8221; with ample powers over Puerto Rico&#8217;s fiscal and economic affairs and those of its public corporations, 

instrumentalities and municipalities (collectively, &#160;

&#8220;PR Government Entities&#8221;). Pursuant &#160;

to PROMESA, the &#160;

Oversight Board will be &#160;

in 

place &#160;

until &#160;

market &#160;

access &#160;

is &#160;

restored &#160;

and &#160;

balanced &#160;

budgets &#160;

are &#160;

produced &#160;

for &#160;

at &#160;

least &#160;

four &#160;

consecutive &#160;

years. &#160;

PROMESA &#160;

also 

established two &#160;

mechanisms for &#160;

the restructuring &#160;

of the &#160;

obligations of &#160;

PR Government &#160;

Entities: (a) &#160;

Title III, &#160;

which provides &#160;

an in-

court process that incorporates many of the &#160;

powers and provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code &#160;

and permits adjustment of a broad 

range of obligations, and &#160;

(b) Title VI, &#160;

which provides for a &#160;

largely out-of-court process through which &#160;

modifications to financial debt 

can be accepted by a supermajority of creditors &#160;

and bind holdouts. 

Since 2017, Puerto Rico and several &#160;

of its instrumentalities have availed themselves &#160;

of the debt restructuring mechanisms of Titles 

III and VI of PROMESA. The Puerto Rico government emerged from Title III of PROMESA in March 2022. Several instrumentalities, 

including &#160;

Government &#160;

Development &#160;

Bank &#160;

for &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico, &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

Sales &#160;

Tax &#160;

Financing &#160;

Corporation, &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico 

Highways &#160;

and &#160;

Transportation &#160;

Authority, &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

Industrial &#160;

Development &#160;

Company, &#160;

have &#160;

also &#160;

completed &#160;

debt 

restructurings &#160;

under &#160;

Titles &#160;

III &#160;

or &#160;

VI &#160;

of &#160;

PROMESA. &#160;

While &#160;

the &#160;

majority &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

debt &#160;

has &#160;

already &#160;

been &#160;

restructured, &#160;

some &#160;

PR 

Government &#160;

Entities &#160;

still &#160;

face &#160;

significant &#160;

fiscal &#160;

challenges. &#160;

For &#160;

example, &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

Electric &#160;

Power &#160;

Authority &#160;

is &#160;

still &#160;

in &#160;

the 

process of restructuring its debts under Title III of PROMESA. 

Municipalities. &#160;

Puerto Rico&#8217;s &#160;

fiscal and &#160;

economic challenges &#160;

have also &#160;

adversely impacted its &#160;

municipalities. Historically, &#160;

the central &#160;

government 

provided &#160;

significant &#160;

annual &#160;

subsidies &#160;

to &#160;

municipalities &#160;

based &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

statutory &#160;

formula. &#160;

However, &#160;

as &#160;

part &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

fiscal &#160;

measures 

required &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board, &#160;

municipal &#160;

subsidies &#160;

have &#160;

decreased &#160;

significantly &#160;

over &#160;

several &#160;

years &#160;

and &#160;

are &#160;

now &#160;

approved 

through specific, non-recurring &#160;

appropriations. This decrease &#160;

has been partially &#160;

offset by &#160;

substantial non-recurring federal &#160;

disaster 

and &#160;

COVID-relief funding &#160;

received by &#160;

municipalities in &#160;

recent years. &#160;

The latest &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

fiscal plan &#160;

certified by &#160;

the Oversight 

Board provides for &#160;

the implementation of &#160;

a restructured grant &#160;

and transfer system &#160;

through which the &#160;

Commonwealth would award 

specific &#160;

service &#160;

grants to &#160;

municipalities to &#160;

augment &#160;

existing municipal &#160;

service &#160;

delivery, &#160;

while also &#160;

incentivizing performance &#160;

and 

enhanced accountability through the monitoring of outcome &#160;

metrics. &#160;

Municipalities are subject to PROMESA, and the Oversight Board &#160;

has the authority to require them to submit fiscal plans and annual 

budgets for &#160;

review and &#160;

approval. The &#160;

Oversight Board &#160;

has imposed &#160;

this requirement &#160;

for certain &#160;

municipalities. Municipalities &#160;

are 

also &#160;

required &#160;

to &#160;

seek &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board &#160;

approval &#160;

to &#160;

issue, &#160;

guarantee &#160;

or &#160;

modify &#160;

their &#160;

debts &#160;

and &#160;

to &#160;

enter &#160;

into &#160;

contracts &#160;

with &#160;

an 

aggregate value of &#160;

$10 million or &#160;

more. With the &#160;

Oversight Board&#8217;s approval, &#160;

municipalities are also &#160;

eligible to avail &#160;

themselves of 

the &#160;

debt &#160;

restructuring processes &#160;

provided &#160;

by &#160;

PROMESA. To &#160;

date, &#160;

however, &#160;

no municipality &#160;

has &#160;

been &#160;

subject to &#160;

any &#160;

such &#160;

debt 

restructuring process. 

&#160;

&#160;

Exposure of the Corporation &#160;

The credit &#160;

quality of BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

loan portfolio &#160;

reflects, among other &#160;

things, the &#160;

general economic conditions &#160;

in Puerto &#160;

Rico and &#160;

other 

adverse conditions affecting Puerto &#160;

Rico consumers and businesses. &#160;

Deterioration in the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy has resulted &#160;

in the 

past, and could &#160;

result in the future, &#160;

in higher delinquencies, greater &#160;

charge-offs and increased losses, &#160;

which could materially affect 

our financial condition and results of operations. &#160;

At September &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

direct exposure &#160;

to PR &#160;

Government Entities &#160;

totaled $336 &#160;

million, of &#160;

which $336 &#160;

million 

were &#160;

outstanding, &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

$362 &#160;

million &#160;

at &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2023, &#160;

of &#160;

which &#160;

$333 &#160;

million &#160;

were &#160;

outstanding. &#160;

A &#160;

deterioration &#160;

in 

Puerto Rico&#8217;s fiscal &#160;

and economic situation could adversely &#160;

affect the value of &#160;

our Puerto Rico government &#160;

obligations, resulting in 

losses to us. Of &#160;

the amount outstanding, $323 million &#160;

consists of loans and &#160;

$13 million are securities ($314 &#160;

million and $19 million, 

respectively, at December 31, &#160;

2023). Substantially all of the Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure outstanding at September 30, &#160;

2024 were 

obligations from various &#160;

Puerto Rico municipalities. &#160;

In most &#160;

cases, these were &#160;

&#8220;general obligations&#8221; of &#160;

a municipality, &#160;

to which &#160;

the 

applicable municipality &#160;

has &#160;

pledged its &#160;

good faith, &#160;

credit &#160;

and unlimited &#160;

taxing &#160;

power, &#160;

or &#8220;special &#160;

obligations&#8221; of &#160;

a municipality, &#160;

to 

which &#160;

the &#160;

applicable &#160;

municipality &#160;

has &#160;

pledged &#160;

basic &#160;

property &#160;

tax &#160;

or &#160;

sales &#160;

tax &#160;

revenues.

At &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2024, &#160;

80% &#160;

of &#160;

the 

Corporation&#8217;s exposure &#160;

to municipal loans &#160;

and securities was &#160;

concentrated in the &#160;

municipalities of San &#160;

Juan, Guaynabo, &#160;

Carolina 

and Caguas. &#160;

In July 2024, the Corporation received scheduled principal payments amounting to $40 million from various obligations 

from Puerto &#160;

Rico municipalities. For &#160;

additional discussion of &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

direct exposure to &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico government and 

its &#160;

instrumentalities &#160;

and &#160;

In &#160;

addition, &#160;

at &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2024, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

had &#160;

$225 &#160;

million &#160;

in &#160;

loans &#160;

insured &#160;

or &#160;

securities &#160;

issued &#160;

by &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico 

governmental entities, &#160;

but for &#160;

which the &#160;

principal source &#160;

of repayment &#160;

is non-governmental &#160;

($238 million at &#160;

December 31, 2023). 

These &#160;

included &#160;

$179 &#160;

million &#160;

in &#160;

residential mortgage &#160;

loans &#160;

insured by &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

Housing &#160;

Finance Authority &#160;

(&#8220;HFA&#8221;), &#160;

a PR 

Government &#160;

Entity &#160;

(December &#160;

31, &#160;

2023 &#160;

- &#160;

$191 &#160;

million). &#160;

These &#160;

mortgage &#160;

loans &#160;

are &#160;

secured &#160;

by &#160;

first &#160;

mortgages &#160;

on &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico 

residential properties &#160;

and the &#160;

HFA insurance &#160;

covers losses &#160;

in the &#160;

event of &#160;

a borrower &#160;

default and &#160;

upon the &#160;

satisfaction of &#160;

certain 

other &#160;

conditions. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation also &#160;

had &#160;

at &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2024, &#160;

$38 &#160;

million &#160;

in &#160;

bonds &#160;

issued &#160;

by &#160;

HFA &#160;

which &#160;

are &#160;

secured &#160;

by 

second &#160;

mortgage loans &#160;

on Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

residential properties, &#160;

and for &#160;

which HFA &#160;

also provides &#160;

insurance to &#160;

cover losses &#160;

in the 

event of a borrower default, and upon the satisfaction of &#160;

certain other conditions (December 31, 2023 - $40 million). In &#160;

the event that 

the mortgage loans insured by HFA and held by the Corporation directly or those &#160;

serving as collateral for the HFA bonds default and 

the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans, HFA&#8217;s &#160;

ability to honor its insurance will depend, among 

other factors, &#160;

on the &#160;

financial condition &#160;

of HFA &#160;

at the &#160;

time such &#160;

obligations become &#160;

due and &#160;

payable. The &#160;

Corporation does &#160;

not 

consider the government guarantee when estimating &#160;

the credit losses associated with this portfolio. &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

commercial loan &#160;

portfolio also &#160;

includes loans &#160;

to &#160;

private borrowers &#160;

who &#160;

are service &#160;

providers, lessors, &#160;

suppliers or &#160;

have 

other relationships with the government. These borrowers could be negatively &#160;

affected by a deterioration in the fiscal and &#160;

economic 

situation &#160;

of &#160;

PR &#160;

Government &#160;

Entities. &#160;

Similarly, &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

mortgage &#160;

and &#160;

consumer &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolios &#160;

include &#160;

loans &#160;

to &#160;

government 

employees &#160;

and &#160;

retirees, &#160;

which &#160;

could &#160;

also &#160;

be &#160;

negatively &#160;

affected &#160;

by &#160;

fiscal &#160;

measures, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

employee &#160;

layoffs &#160;

or &#160;

furloughs &#160;

or 

reductions in pension benefits, if the fiscal and economic &#160;

situation deteriorates. 

As &#160;

of &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2024, &#160;

BPPR &#160;

had &#160;

$18.7 &#160;

billion &#160;

in &#160;

deposits &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

government, &#160;

its &#160;

instrumentalities, &#160;

and 

municipalities. The rate at &#160;

which public deposit balances may &#160;

decline is uncertain and &#160;

difficult to predict. The &#160;

amount and timing of 

any such &#160;

reduction is &#160;

likely to &#160;

be impacted &#160;

by, &#160;

for example, &#160;

the speed &#160;

at which &#160;

federal assistance &#160;

is distributed &#160;

and the &#160;

financial 

condition, liquidity &#160;

and cash &#160;

management practices of &#160;

such entities, &#160;

as well &#160;

as on &#160;

the ability &#160;

of BPPR &#160;

to maintain &#160;

these customer 

relationships.

and &#160;

has &#160;

credit &#160;

exposure &#160;

to &#160;

USVI &#160;

government 

entities. 

The USVI has &#160;

been experiencing a &#160;

number of fiscal &#160;

and economic challenges, &#160;

which could adversely &#160;

affect the &#160;

ability of its &#160;

public 

corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding &#160;

debt obligations. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI &#160;

and, as such, 

there &#160;

is &#160;

currently &#160;

no &#160;

federal &#160;

legislation &#160;

permitting &#160;

the &#160;

restructuring &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

debts &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

USVI &#160;

and &#160;

its &#160;

public &#160;

corporations &#160;

and 

instrumentalities. 

To &#160;

the extent that &#160;

the fiscal condition &#160;

of the USVI &#160;

continues to deteriorate, the &#160;

U.S. Congress or the &#160;

Government of the &#160;

USVI may 

enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the &#160;

financial obligations of USVI government entities or imposing a &#160;

stay on creditor 

remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable &#160;

to the USVI. 

&#160;

&#160;

At September 30, &#160;

2024, the Corporation &#160;

had approximately $28 &#160;

million in direct &#160;

exposure to USVI &#160;

government entities (December 

31, 2023 - $28 million). &#160;

which &#160;

was &#160;

negatively &#160;

affected by &#160;

the &#160;

COVID-19 &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

30, &#160;

2024, &#160;

it &#160;

a &#160;

portfolio &#160;

amounting &#160;

to 

approximately &#160;

$200 &#160;

comprised &#160;

of &#160;

various &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

portfolio &#160;

of &#160;

$205 &#160;

million &#160;

at

U.S. Government 

As further detailed in Notes &#160;

5 and 6 to the &#160;

Consolidated Financial Statements, a substantial portion of the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s investment 

securities &#160;

represented exposure &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Government in &#160;

the &#160;

form &#160;

of &#160;

U.S. Government &#160;

sponsored entities, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

agency 

mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities. In &#160;

addition, $2.0 billion of residential mortgages and $88.4 million commercial &#160;

loans 

were insured &#160;

or guaranteed &#160;

by the &#160;

U.S. Government &#160;

or its &#160;

agencies at &#160;

September 30, &#160;

2024 (compared &#160;

to $1.9 &#160;

billion and &#160;

$89.2 

million, respectively, at December 31, 2023).

Non-Performing Assets 

Non-performing assets (&#8220;NPAs&#8221;) &#160;

include primarily past-due &#160;

loans that &#160;

are no &#160;

longer accruing interest, &#160;

renegotiated loans, and &#160;

real 

estate property acquired through foreclosure. A summary, including certain credit &#160;

quality metrics, is presented in Table 19. 

During the third &#160;

quarter of 2024, &#160;

the Corporation continued &#160;

to reflect stable &#160;

credit quality metrics &#160;

in the third &#160;

quarter of 2024 &#160;

when 

compared to &#160;

the previous &#160;

quarter. &#160;

While non-performing &#160;

loans (&#8220;NPLs&#8221;), &#160;

net charge &#160;

offs (&#8220;NCOs&#8221;) &#160;

and inflows &#160;

to NPLs &#160;

remained 

below historical averages, consumer portfolios &#160;

reflected increased delinquencies and NCOs &#160;

for the quarter primarily &#160;

driven by auto 

loans. The &#160;

mortgage and &#160;

commercial portfolios &#160;

continue to &#160;

operate with &#160;

low levels &#160;

of delinquencies &#160;

and NCOs. &#160;

The Corporation 

continues to closely monitor changes in the macroeconomic &#160;

environment and borrower performance given higher interest rates and 

inflationary pressures. Management believes that the improvements over recent years in risk management practices and the overall 

risk profile of the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolios position &#160;

Popular to continue to operate successfully under &#160;

the current environment. 

Total &#160;

NPAs &#160;

as of &#160;

September 30, &#160;

2024 decreased &#160;

by $14 &#160;

million when &#160;

compared with &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2023. Total &#160;

non-performing 

loans held-in-portfolio &#160;

(&#8220;NPLs&#8221;) increased &#160;

by $4 &#160;

million from &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2023. BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

NPLs decreased &#160;

by $40 &#160;

million, across 

most loan &#160;

categories, except &#160;

consumer NPLs &#160;

which reflected &#160;

an increase &#160;

of $4 &#160;

million. The &#160;

increase in &#160;

the consumer &#160;

NPLs was 

mostly driven by auto &#160;

loans. Popular U.S. NPLs increased &#160;

by $44 million, driven &#160;

by higher commercial and mortgage &#160;

NPLs by $27 

million and $17 million, respectively, each impacted by single loans amounting &#160;

to $17 million. &#160;

On September &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

the ratio &#160;

of NPLs &#160;

to total &#160;

loans held-in-portfolio &#160;

was 1.0%, &#160;

flat when &#160;

compared to &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2023. 

Other real estate owned loans (&#8220;OREOs&#8221;) decreased by $17 &#160;

million from December 31, 2023. The decrease in OREO &#160;

was driven by 

the sale of &#160;

a commercial property in &#160;

BPPR, coupled with the &#160;

sale of residential properties. &#160;

On September 30, 2024, &#160;

NPLs secured 

by real &#160;

estate amounted to &#160;

$202 million in &#160;

the Puerto Rico &#160;

operations and $67 &#160;

million in Popular &#160;

U.S, compared with &#160;

$231 million 

and $24 million, respectively, on December 31, 2023. 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

commercial loan &#160;

portfolio secured &#160;

by real &#160;

estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) &#160;

amounted to &#160;

$10.7 billion &#160;

on September &#160;

30, 2024, &#160;

of 

which &#160;

$3.1 &#160;

billion &#160;

was &#160;

secured &#160;

compared &#160;

with &#160;

$10.6 &#160;

and &#160;

$3.1 &#160;

billion, &#160;

respectively, &#160;

on 

December 31, &#160;

2023. Office &#160;

space leasing exposure &#160;

in our &#160;

non-owner occupied CRE &#160;

portfolio is limited, &#160;

representing only 2.0% &#160;

or 

$708 million of our total loan portfolio. The &#160;

exposure is mainly comprised of low- to mid- rise properties with an &#160;

average loan size of 

$2.3 million and is well diversified across tenant &#160;

type. 

CRE NPLs amounted to $67 million on September 30, 2024, compared with $48 million on December 31, 2023, driven by the single 

$17 &#160;

million &#160;

loan &#160;

mentioned &#160;

above. &#160;

The &#160;

CRE &#160;

NPL &#160;

ratios &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

BPPR &#160;

and &#160;

Popular &#160;

U.S. &#160;

segments &#160;

were &#160;

0.70% &#160;

and &#160;

0.57%, 

respectively, on September 30, 2024, compared with 0.86% and 0.13%, &#160;

respectively, on December 31, 2023. 

In &#160;

there &#160;

were &#160;

$587 &#160;

million &#160;

of &#160;

performing &#160;

mostly 

commercial &#160;

as &#160;

non-performing 

(December 31, 2023 - $510 million). 

For &#160;

the &#160;

September 30, &#160;

2024, &#160;

total &#160;

inflows &#160;

of &#160;

NPLs held-in-portfolio, &#160;

excluding consumer &#160;

loans, &#160;

increased by &#160;

$16 

million, when compared to the inflows for the same period in 2023. Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at the &#160;

BPPR segment remained 

flat, compared &#160;

to the &#160;

same period &#160;

in 2023. &#160;

Inflows of &#160;

NPLs held-in-portfolio at &#160;

the Popular &#160;

U.S. segment increased &#160;

by $17 million 

from the same period in 2023, mainly driven by higher &#160;

mortgage inflows by $16 million driven by abovementioned &#160;

$17 million loan.

Loan Delinquencies 

Another key measure used to evaluate and &#160;

monitor the Corporation&#8217;s asset quality is loan &#160;

delinquencies. Loans delinquent 30 days 

or more, as a percentage of their related portfolio &#160;

category on September 30, 2024 and December 31, &#160;

2023, are presented below.

Loans delinquent 30 days or more includes $0.4 billion &#160;

of residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed &#160;

by the VA as of September 

30, 2024 (December 31, 2023 - $0.5 billion). Refer to Note &#160;

7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information &#160;

of guaranteed loans. 

Allowance for Credit Losses Loans Held-in-Portfolio 

The ACL, &#160;

represents management&#8217;s &#160;

estimate of &#160;

expected credit &#160;

losses through &#160;

the remaining &#160;

contractual life &#160;

of the &#160;

different loan 

segments, impacted by expected prepayments. The ACL &#160;

is maintained at a sufficient &#160;

level to provide for estimated credit &#160;

losses on 

collateral dependent loans as well as loans modified &#160;

for borrowers with financial difficulties separately from the remainder &#160;

of the loan 

portfolio. The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

management evaluates the adequacy &#160;

of the ACL &#160;

on a quarterly &#160;

basis. In this &#160;

evaluation, management 

considers current &#160;

conditions, macroeconomic &#160;

economic expectations through &#160;

a reasonable &#160;

and supportable &#160;

period, historical &#160;

loss 

experience, &#160;

portfolio composition &#160;

by &#160;

loan &#160;

type &#160;

and &#160;

risk &#160;

characteristics, &#160;

results &#160;

of &#160;

periodic credit &#160;

reviews &#160;

of &#160;

individual loans, &#160;

and 

regulatory requirements, amongst other factors. 

The Corporation must rely on &#160;

estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where &#160;

the ultimate outcome is unknown, such &#160;

as 

economic developments affecting specific &#160;

customers, industries, or markets. &#160;

Other factors that can &#160;

affect management&#8217;s estimates 

are &#160;

recalibration &#160;

of &#160;

statistical &#160;

models &#160;

used &#160;

to &#160;

calculate &#160;

lifetime &#160;

expected &#160;

losses, &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

underwriting &#160;

standards, &#160;

financial 

accounting standards and loan impairment measurements, &#160;

among others. Changes in the financial condition &#160;

of individual borrowers, 

in economic &#160;

conditions, and &#160;

in the &#160;

condition of &#160;

the various &#160;

markets in &#160;

which collateral &#160;

may be &#160;

sold, may &#160;

also affect &#160;

the required 

level of &#160;

the allowance &#160;

for credit &#160;

losses. Consequently, &#160;

the business &#160;

financial condition, &#160;

liquidity, &#160;

capital, and &#160;

results of &#160;

operations 

could also be affected. 

On September 30, 2024, &#160;

the ACL increased by &#160;

$15 million from December &#160;

31, 2023 to $744 &#160;

million. The ACL for &#160;

BPPR increased 

by &#160;

$26 &#160;

million, &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

an &#160;

increase &#160;

of &#160;

$16 &#160;

million &#160;

in &#160;

reserves &#160;

for &#160;

commercial &#160;

loans &#160;

and &#160;

a &#160;

combined &#160;

$12 &#160;

million &#160;

increase &#160;

in 

reserves for &#160;

the consumer &#160;

and lease &#160;

portfolios. These &#160;

increases were &#160;

mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

a combination &#160;

of &#160;

growth in &#160;

the commercial 

portfolio and changes in credit quality trends for the auto and credit cards portfolios. In PB, the ACL decreased by $11 &#160;

million, when 

compared &#160;

to &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2023, &#160;

mainly &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

lower &#160;

reserves &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

commercial &#160;

and &#160;

construction &#160;

portfolios &#160;

due &#160;

to 

improvements &#160;

in &#160;

credit &#160;

quality &#160;

and &#160;

lower &#160;

balances. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

ratio &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

allowance &#160;

for &#160;

credit &#160;

losses &#160;

to &#160;

loans &#160;

held-in-

portfolio was 2.06% on September 30, 2024, compared to &#160;

2.08% on December 31, 2023. The ratio of the &#160;

allowance for credit losses 

to NPLs held-in-portfolio stood at 206.0%, compared &#160;

to 204.0% on December 31, 2023. 

Given that any one &#160;

economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the &#160;

Corporation leverages multiple scenarios to estimate &#160;

its ACL. The 

baseline scenario continues to be assigned the highest probability, &#160;

followed by the pessimistic scenario. The weight assigned to the 

pessimistic &#160;

scenario &#160;

decreased &#160;

during &#160;

the &#160;

first &#160;

quarter &#160;

of &#160;

2024 &#160;

in &#160;

response &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

positive &#160;

momentum &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

economy &#160;

as 

expectations for &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve achieving &#160;

a soft &#160;

landing have &#160;

improved. The &#160;

Corporation evaluates, &#160;

at least &#160;

on an &#160;

annual 

basis, the assumptions tied to the CECL accounting framework. These include &#160;

the reasonable and supportable period as well as the 

reversion window. 

The provision &#160;

for credit &#160;

losses related &#160;

to the &#160;

loans held-in-portfolio &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

September 30, &#160;

2024, was &#160;

$72.8 &#160;

million, 

compared to $43.5 &#160;

million for the &#160;

quarter ended September &#160;

30, 2023, largely &#160;

driven by higher &#160;

NCOs due to &#160;

credit quality changes 

and commercial loan growth. The provision &#160;

expense related to the loans-held-in-portfolio for the &#160;

nine months ended September 30, 

2024 &#160;

was &#160;

$189.3 million, &#160;

compared to &#160;

the &#160;

provision expense &#160;

of &#160;

$126.3 million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

nine months &#160;

ended September &#160;

30, 2023.
