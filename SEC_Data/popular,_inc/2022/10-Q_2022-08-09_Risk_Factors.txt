 Item 1A. Risk Factors 

&#160; 

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed under &#8220;Part I- Item 1A- Risk Factors&#8221; in our 2021 Form10-K and under &#8220;Part II&#8211;Item1A- Risk Factors&#8221; of any subsequent Quarterly Report on Form10-Q.These factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position, and could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Also refer to the discussion in &#8220;Part I- Item 2&#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in this report for additional information that may supplement or update the discussion of the risk factors below and in our 2021 Form10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form10-Q. The risks described in our 2021 Form 10-K and in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position. There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed under &#8220;Part I- Item 1- A- Risk Factors&#8221; in our 2021 Form 10-K, except for the risks included below which supplement the risk factors described in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

Risk Factors 

&#160; 

Complying with economic and trade sanctions programs and anti-money laundering laws and regulations can increase our operational and compliance costs and risks. If we, and our subsidiaries, affiliates or third-party service providers, are found to have failed to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions programs and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, we could be exposed to fines, sanctions and penalties, and other regulatory actions, as well as governmental investigations. 

&#160; 

As a federally regulated financial institution, we must comply with regulations and economic and trade sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) of the U.S. Treasury, as well as anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including those under the Bank Secrecy Act. 

&#160; 

Economic and trade sanctions regulations and programs administered by OFAC prohibit U.S.-based entities from entering into or facilitating unlicensed transactions with, for the benefit of, or in some cases involving the property and property interests of, persons, governments or countries designated by the U.S. government under one or more sanctions regimes, and also prohibit transactions that provide a benefit that is received in a country designated under one or more sanctions regimes. We are also subject to a variety of reporting and other requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act, including the requirement to file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports, that are designed to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and other criminal activities. In addition, as a financial institution we are required to, among other things, identify our customers, adopt formal and comprehensive anti-money laundering programs, scrutinize or altogether prohibit certain transactions of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S. law enforcement agencies concerning our customers and their transactions. Failure by the Corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates or third-party service providers to comply with these laws and regulations could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the Corporation, including the possibility of regulatory enforcement or other legal action, including significant civil and criminal penalties. We can also incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating our businesses to comply with these requirements. The markets in which we operate heighten these costs and risks. 

&#160; 

We have established risk-based policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with these applicable laws and regulations. With respect to OFAC regulations and economic and trade sanction programs, these policies and procedures employ software to screen transactions for evidence of sanctioned-country and person&#8217;s involvement. Consistent with a risk-based approach and the difficulties in identifying and where applicable, blocking and rejecting transactions of our customers or our customers&#8217; customers that may involve a sanctioned person, government or country, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating applicable laws and regulations in transactions in which we engage, and such violations could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

From time to time we have identified and voluntarily self-disclosed to OFAC transactions that were not timely identified, blocked or rejected by our policies, controls and procedures for screening transactions that might violate the regulations and economic and trade sanctions programs administered by OFAC. For example, during the second quarter of 2022, BPPR entered into a settlement agreement with OFAC with respect to certain transactions processed on behalf of two employees of the Government of Venezuela, in apparent violation of U.S. sanctions against Venezuela. Popular agreed to pay approximately $256,000 to settle the apparent violations, which had been self-disclosed to OFAC. There can be no assurances that any failure to comply with U.S. sanctions and embargoes, or with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, will not result in material fines, sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, if the policies, controls, and procedures of one of the Corporation&#8217;s third-party service providers do not prevent it from violating applicable laws and regulations in transactions in which it engages, such violations could adversely affect its ability to provide services to us, and, in the case of Evertec, could adversely affect the value of our investment in Evertec. 

&#160; 

We are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that, if realized, may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. These cybersecurity risks have been heightened by the increase on our employees&#8217; remote work capabilities, the use of digital channels by our customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and growing economic and geo-political risks. 

&#160; 

Information security risks for large financial institutions such as Popular have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as Internet and mobile banking to conduct instant financial transactions anywhere globally, growing geo-political threats, such as the ongoing Russian conflict in Ukraine, and the increased sophistication and 

&#160; 

activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, hacktivists and other parties. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to transmit and store sensitive data. We employ a layered defensive approach that employs people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls through a variety of preventative and detective tools that monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity and identify suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding our defensive measures and the significant resources we devote to protect the security of our systems, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective at all times, especially as the threats from cyber-attacks is continuous and severe. The risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future as we continue to expand our mobile banking and other internet-based product offerings, Popular&#8217;s use of the cloud for system development and hosting and internal use of internet-based products and applications. 

&#160; 

We continue to detect and identify attacks that are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume, as well as attackers that respond rapidly to changes in defensive countermeasures. The most significant cyber-attack risks that we may face are e-fraud, denial-of-service (DDoS), ransomware, computer intrusion and the exploitation of software zero-day vulnerabilities that might result in disruption of services and in the exposure or loss of customer or proprietary data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals compromise our systems or the systems of our customers and extract funds from customer&#8217;s credit cards or bank accounts, including through brute force, password spraying and credential stuffing attacks directed at gaining unauthorized access to individual accounts. Denial-of-service attacks intentionally disrupt the ability of legitimate users, including customers and employees, to access networks, websites and online resources. Computer intrusion attempts either direct or through email, text or voice messages, including using brand impersonation (regularly referred to as phishing, vishing and smishing), might result in the compromise of sensitive customer data, such as account numbers, credit cards and social security numbers, and could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs to Popular if successful. 

&#160; 

We have been the target of phishing, smishing and vishing attacks in the past, targeting both our customers and employees through brand, email, text and voicemail impersonation, that have compromised the email accounts of certain of our customers and employees or have resulted in our customer&#8217;s being deceived into revealing their information to attackers. We continually monitor and address those vulnerabilities and continue to enhance our security measures to detect and prevent such incidents, while enhancing employee and customer trainings and awareness campaigns. There can be no assurances, however, that there will not be further compromises of sensitive customer information in the future. Our customer-facing platforms are also routinely attacked by threat actors aiming to gain unauthorized access to our clients&#8217; accounts. Popular has recently implemented certain defensive measures in response to brute force attacks on one of our platforms and, while our investigation of these brute force attacks remains ongoing, we have to date not experienced material losses in connection with these attacks. Cyber-security risks have also been recently exacerbated by the discovery of zero-day vulnerabilities in widely distributed third party software, such as the vulnerability identified in December 2021 in the Apache log4j, which could affect Popular&#8217;s or any of its service provider&#8217;s systems. 

&#160; 

The increased use of remote access and third-party video conferencing solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic, to enable work-from-home arrangements for employees and facilitating the use of digital channels by our customers, has increased our exposure to cyber attacks. In addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by Popular&#8217;s customers or employees. Recent events, including the Russian conflict in Ukraine, have also illustrated increased geo-political factors and the risks related to supply-chain compromises and de-stabilizing activities linked to nation-state sponsored activity as an increasing trend to monitor actively. Risks and exposures related to cyber security attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, including the rise in the use of cyber-attacks as geopolitical weapons, as well as the expanding use of digital channels for banking, such as mobile banking and other technology-based products and services used by us and our customers. Although we are regularly targeted by unauthorized threat-actor activity, we have not, to date, experienced any material losses as a result of any cyber-attacks. 

&#160; 

A successful compromise or circumvention of the security of our systems could have serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations and those of our clients, customers and counterparties, misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients, customers, counterparties or employees, or damage to computers or systems used by us or by our clients, customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. For example, if personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information in our possession were to be mishandled, misused or stolen, we could suffer significant 

&#160; 

regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, Popular may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, and that damage may continue to spread. These factors may inhibit our ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information about the cyber attack to our clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the potential harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the impact of the incident and thereby the costs and consequences of a cyber attack. For a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; in Part I, Item 1 &#8212; Business, included in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. 

&#160; 

We also rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information security, technology and business process services. As a result, a successful compromise or circumvention of the security of the systems of these third-party service providers could have serious negative consequences for us, including misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients, customers, counterparties or employees, or other negative implications identified above with respect to a cyber-attack on our systems, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The most important of these third-party service providers for us is Evertec, and certain risks particular to Evertec are discussed under &#8220;Risks Relating to our Relationship with Evertec&#8221;. During 2021, we determined that, as a result of the widely reported breach of Accellion, Inc.&#8217;s File Transfer Appliance tool, which was being used at the time of such breach by a U.S.-based third-party advisory services vendor of Popular, personal information of certain Popular customers was compromised. As a result, Popular notified, as required or otherwise deemed appropriate, customers identified as affected by the incident. Although we are not aware of fraudulent activity in connection with this incident, Popular&#8217;s networks and systems were not impacted, and our third-party service provider agreed to cover external remediation costs associated with the incident. A compromise of the personal information of our customers maintained by third party vendors could result in significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss to us. The success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these (and other) third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner, which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties&#8217; suppliers or vendors (so-called &#8220;fourth party risk&#8221;). We may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate fourth-party risk, in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us. 

&#160; 

As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. System enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including risks associated with supply chain compromises and the software development lifecycle of the systems used by us and our service providers. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, addressing certain information security vulnerabilities, such as hardware-based vulnerabilities, may affect the performance of our information technology systems. The ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors. Moreover, our ability to timely mitigate vulnerabilities and manage such risks, given the rise in number of required patches and third-party software &#8220;zero-day vulnerabilities&#8221;, may impact our day-to-day operations, the availability of our systems and delay the deployment of technology enhancements and innovation. 

&#160; 

If Popular&#8217;s operational systems, or those of external parties on which Popular&#8217;s businesses depend, are unable to meet the requirements of our businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, Popular could be materially and adversely affected. 

&#160; 

We are dependent on Evertec for certain of our core financial transaction processing and information technology and security services, which exposes us to a number of operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on us. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In connection with the sale of a 51% ownership interest in Evertec in the third quarter of 2010, we entered into a long-term Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement (the &#8220;Original MSA&#8221;) with Evertec, pursuant to which we agreed to receive from Evertec, on an exclusive basis, certain core banking and financial transaction processing and information technology and security services. 

&#160; 

As previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 1, 2022, on July 1, 2022 (the &#8220;Evertec Closing&#8221;) we closed the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement dated February 24, 2022 by and among Evertec, Evertec Group, LLC, BPPR and Popular, pursuant to which we purchased from Evertec certain information technology and related assets used by Evertec to service certain of BPPR&#8217;s key channels (the &#8220;Acquired Assets&#8221;) and assumed certain liabilities relating thereto (the &#8220;Evertec Transaction&#8221;) . On the Evertec Closing, the parties to the Evertec Transaction also amended and restated certain commercial agreements, including the Original MSA (the &#8220;Second A&#38;R MSA&#8221;), pursuant to which Evertec will continue to provide various necessary financial transaction processing, security and technology services to Popular, BPPR and their respective subsidiaries, which services were previously provided under the Original MSA. The term of the Second A&#38;R MSA will expire on September 30, 2028, a three-year extension of the term of the Original MSA. We also amended and restated the agreement pursuant to which BPPR sponsors Evertec as an independent sales organization with respect to certain credit card associations, which contains certain exclusivity and non-solicitation restrictions with respect to merchant services (the &#8220;ISO Agreement&#8221;), as well as the agreement pursuant to which BPPR has committed to support the ATH brand and network (the &#8220;ATH Agreement&#8221;). Although the Evertec Transaction narrowed the scope of services which we are dependent on Evertec to obtain and released us from exclusivity restrictions that limited our ability to engage other third-party providers of financial technology services, we continue to be dependent on Evertec for the provision of essential services to our business, including our core banking business, and there can be no assurances that the quality of the services will be appropriate or that Evertec will be able to continue to provide us with the necessary financial transaction processing, security and technology services. As a result, our relationship with Evertec exposes us to operational, cybersecurity and business risks that could have a material adverse effect on us. 

&#160; 

As a result of our agreements with Evertec, we are particularly exposed to the operational risks of Evertec, including those relating to a breakdown or failure of Evertec&#8217;s systems or internal controls environment, including as a result of security breaches or attacks, employee error or malfeasance, system breakdowns, vulnerabilities, obsolescence or otherwise. Over the term of the Original MSA, we experienced various interruptions and delays in key services provided by Evertec, as well as cyber breaches, as a result of system breakdowns, misconfigurations and instances of application obsolescence, which has led in the past to exposure of BPPR customer information. There can be no assurances that there will not be further compromises of sensitive customer information in the future because of the aforementioned causes. The continuance or increase in service delays or interruptions, vulnerabilities in Evertec&#8217;s information systems, or cyberattacks to, or breaches to the confidentiality of the information that resides in such systems, could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services, expose us to regulatory, legal and compliance risk and damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Evertec&#8217;s inability to timely address evolving cybersecurity threats may further exacerbate these risks. For further information regarding our cybersecurity risks, refer to the &#8220;We are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that, if realized, could adversely affect how we conduct our business&#8221; risk factor. Our ability to recover from Evertec for breach of the Second A&#38;R MSA, including the failure to meet the service levels or comply with other obligations regarding information security provided for therein, may not fully compensate us for the damages we may suffer as a result of such breach. 

&#160; 

Popular faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry. Considering our continued dependence on Evertec, if Evertec is unable to meet constant technological changes and react quickly to meet new industry standards, we may be unable to enhance our current services and introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, placing us at a competitive disadvantage and significantly affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

We operate in a highly competitive environment in which we must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of technological advances. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. We compete on the basis of the quality and variety of products and services offered, innovation, price, ease of use, reputation and transaction execution. To compete effectively, we need to constantly enhance and modify our products and services and introduce new products and services to attract and retain clients or to match products and services offered by our competitors, including technology companies and other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services. Although the Evertec Transaction eliminated certain provisions of the Original MSA that required us to use Evertec exclusively to develop and implement new or enhanced products and services, and 

&#160; 

is expected to improve Popular&#8217;s ability to manage and control the development of the customer channels supported by the Acquired Assets, Popular expects that it will continue to depend on Evertec&#8217;s technology services to operate and control current products and services and to implement future products and services, making our success dependent on Evertec&#8217;s ability to timely complete and introduce these enhancements and new products and services in a cost-effective manner. Our ability to enhance our customer channels is also dependent on Evertec timely delivering core application programming interfaces (the &#8220;Core APIs&#8221;) that meet BPPR&#8217;s requirements, which Evertec has committed to develop under the Second A&#38;R MSA. The Core APIs are necessary for BPPR to connect future enhancements to the Acquired Assets to existing Evertec core applications. 

&#160; 

Some of our competitors rely on financial services technology and outsourcing companies that are much larger than Evertec, serve a greater number of clients than Evertec, and may have better technological capabilities and product offerings than Evertec. Furthermore, financial services technology companies typically make capital investments to develop and modify their product and service offerings to facilitate their customers&#8217; compliance with the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, and in most cases such costs are borne by the technology provider. Because of our contractual relationship with Evertec, and because Popular is the sole customer of certain of Evertec&#8217;s services and products, we have in the past borne the full cost of such developments and modifications and may be required to do so in the future, subject to the terms of the Second A&#38;R MSA. 

&#160; 

Moreover, the terms, speed, scalability and functionality of certain of Evertec&#8217;s technology services are not competitive when compared to offerings from its competitors. Evertec&#8217;s failure to sufficiently invest in and upscale its technology and services infrastructure to meet the rapidly changing technology demands of our industry may result in us being unable to meet customer expectations and attract or retain customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce Popular&#8217;s revenues, place us in a competitive disadvantage and significantly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While the closing of the Evertec Transaction narrowed the scope of services which we are dependent on Evertec to obtain and released us from exclusivity restrictions that limited our ability to engage other third-party providers of financial technology services, it also resulted in extensions of certain existing commercial agreements with Evertec and, as a result, have prolonged the duration of our exposure to the risks presented by Evertec&#8217;s technological capabilities and its failures to enhance its products and services and otherwise meet evolving demands. 

&#160; 

The transition to new financial services technology providers, and the replacement of services currently provided to us by Evertec, will be lengthy and complex. 

&#160; 

Switching from one vendor of core bank processing and related technology and security services to a new vendor is a complex process that carries business and financial risks. The implementation cycle for such a transition can be lengthy and require significant financial and management resources from us. Such a transition can also expose us, and our clients, to increased costs (including conversion costs), business disruption, as well as operational and cybersecurity risks. Upon the transition of all or a portion of existing services provided by Evertec to a new financial services technology provider, either (i) at the end of the term of the Second A&#38;R MSA and related agreements or (ii) earlier upon the termination of any service for convenience under the Second A&#38;R MSA, these transition risks could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although Evertec has agreed to provide certain transition assistance to us in connection with the termination of the Second A&#38;R MSA, we are ultimately dependent on their ability to provide those services in a responsive and competent manner. Furthermore, we may require transition assistance from Evertec beyond the term of the Second A&#38;R MSA, delaying and lengthening any transition process away from Evertec while increasing related costs. 

&#160; 

Under the Second A&#38;R MSA, we are able to terminate services for convenience with 180 day prior notice. We expect to exercise during the term of the Second A&#38;R MSA the right to terminate certain services for convenience and to transition such services to other service providers prior to the expiration of the Second A&#38;R MSA, subject to complying with the revenue minimums contemplated in the Second A&#38;R MSA and certain other conditions. In practice, in order to switch to a new provider for a particular service, we will have to commence procuring and working on a transition process for such service significantly in advance of its termination and, in any case, much earlier than the automatic renewal notice date or the expiration date of the Second A&#38;R MSA, and such process may extend beyond the current term of the Second A&#38;R MSA. Furthermore, if we were unsuccessful or decided not to complete the transition after expending significant funds and management resources, it could also result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The value of our remaining ownership interest in Evertec could be adversely affected if our relationship with Evertec were to deteriorate materially. The Evertec Transaction also resulted in a material reduction in the value of our ownership 

&#160; 

interest in Evertec, eliminated our rights to nominate directors to Evertec&#8217;s board of directors and will result in the elimination of the income we report from this investment. 

Prior to the closing of the Evertec Transaction, we held a 16.19% ownership interest in Evertec. We continue to have a 10.6% ownership interest in Evertec and account for this investment under the equity method. As a result, we include our investment in Evertec in other assets and our proportionate share of income or loss is included in other operating income in our consolidated statements of operations. For 2021, our share of Evertec&#8217;s changes in equity recognized in income was $26 million. The carrying value of our investment in Evertec was, as of December 31, 2021, approximately $110 million. Meanwhile, the services Evertec delivers to us represent a significant portion of Evertec&#8217;s revenues (approximately 41% for 2021), even after giving effect to the Evertec Transaction. As a result, if we were not to renew the Second A&#38;R MSA and our other current agreements with Evertec, or otherwise terminate them before the end of their terms, Evertec&#8217;s financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the value of our remaining ownership interest in Evertec may be materially reduced. Furthermore, revenue from Evertec&#8217;s merchant acquiring business, which constitutes approximately 24% of Evertec&#8217;s revenues, depends, in part, on Evertec&#8217;s alliance with BPPR. If such relationship were to suffer, or be terminated, Evertec&#8217;s business may be adversely affected. 

&#160; 

Future sales of our Evertec common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, could also adversely affect the market price of Evertec common stock and thus the value we may be able to realize on the sale of our remaining holdings. In particular, in connection with the Evertec Transaction, we have entered into a Registration Rights and Sell-Down Agreement at the closing of the Evertec Transaction, pursuant to which we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell to third parties a sufficient number of our shares of Evertec common stock so as to reduce our ownership of shares of Evertec common stock to no more than 4.99% of the total number of shares of Evertec common stock outstanding on or before September 29, 2022. In addition, the Registration Rights and Sell-Down Agreement provides that any shares of Evertec common stock we own in excess of 4.5% at the end of such ninety-day period will be converted into shares of Evertec non-voting preferred stock that convert back into common stock when transferred in a widespread public distribution or in certain other qualifying transfers. 

&#160; 

The market price of Evertec common stock&#8212;and thus, the value we may be able to realize on the sale of our remaining holdings&#8212;could be negatively affected by the perception that further sales by us could occur as contemplated by the Registration Rights and Sell-Down Agreement, among other factors. Furthermore, the termination at the closing of the Evertec Transaction of the existing Stockholder Agreement between Popular and Evertec, which resulted in the elimination of Popular&#8217;s rights to nominate two directors to Evertec&#8217;s board of directors, among other rights, and Popular&#8217;s commitment under the Registration Rights and Sell-Down Agreement to reduce, within ninety days of the closing of the Evertec Transaction, its ownership of shares of Evertec common stock to no more than 4.99% of the total number of shares of Evertec common stock outstanding, is expected to eliminate Popular&#8217;s earnings from its equity investment in Evertec and subject the valuation of any remaining stake in Evertec to mark-to-market accounting and consequent exposure to market risk. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We are subject to additional risks relating to the Evertec Transaction. 

There are numerous additional risks and uncertainties associated with the Evertec Transaction, including: 

&#61623; unforeseen events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, may materially diminish the expected benefits of the Evertec Transaction; 

&#61623; we will be required to devote significant attention and resources to post closing implementation efforts, which will involve a significant degree of technological complexity and reliance on Evertec and other third parties, including with respect to the set-up of developer tools required to manage the Acquired Assets; 

&#61623; we may be unable to retain the employees and third-party contractors hired or engaged by us in connection with the Evertec Transaction and who are necessary to operate and integrate the Acquired Assets; 

&#61623; we may be subject to incremental operational and security risks arising from the transfer of the Acquired Assets to BPPR, including those risks arising from, among other things, the activities required to execute network segmentation, the possibility of misconfiguration of access or security services during the transition period and during the implementation of new processes or security controls, the possibility of mismanagement of security services during the transition phase, and the need to develop a robust internal control framework; 

&#61623; the anticipated benefits of the Evertec Transaction could be limited if Evertec fails to deliver to BPPR, in a timely manner and in a manner that meets BPPR&#8217;s requirements, the Core APIs that Evertec has committed to develop in order for BPPR to connect future enhancements to the Acquired Assets to existing Evertec core applications; 

&#160; 

&#61623; we may be exposed to heightened business risks as a result of the extension until 2035 of BPPR&#8217;s exclusivity with Evertec in connection with its merchant acquiring business, as well as the extension until 2030 of BPPR&#8217;s commitment with respect to the ATH Network, in light of the pace of technology changes and competition in the payments industry; 

&#61623; Evertec&#8217;s strategy and investments after the closing of the Evertec Transaction may be refocused away from Popular towards other strategic initiatives; 

&#61623; and 

&#61623; we may not be able to execute the contemplated sell down of Evertec shares or otherwise receive any required regulatory approvals to effect a return to shareholders, via common stock repurchases, of any after-tax gains resulting from such sale. 

&#160; 

Any of the foregoing risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, financial condition, and/or stock price. 

&#160;
