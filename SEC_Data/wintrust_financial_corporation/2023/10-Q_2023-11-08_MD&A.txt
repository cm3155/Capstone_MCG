MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition of Wintrust Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, &#8220;Wintrust&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of September 30, 2023 compared with December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, and the results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes contained in this report and the risk factors discussed under Item 1A of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (&#8220;2022 Form 10-K&#8221;) and in Part II, Item 1A, of this Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and, as such, future results could differ significantly from management&#8217;s current expectations. See the last section of this discussion for further information on forward-looking statements. 

Introduction 

Wintrust is a financial holding company that provides traditional community banking services and offers a full array of wealth management services, primarily to customers in the Chicago metropolitan area, southern Wisconsin and northwest Indiana, and operates other financing businesses on a national basis and in Canada through several non-bank business units. 

Overview 

Third Quarter Highlights 

The Company recorded net income of $164.2 million for the third quarter of 2023 compared to $143.0 million in the third quarter of 2022. The results for the third quarter of 2023 demonstrate increased net interest income primarily due to substantial growth in earning assets and increasing net interest margin as well as the Company&#8217;s ability to navigate industry disruptions during the period due to the Company&#8217;s strong deposit franchise and balanced business model. Other key drivers included continued expansion of net interest income as a result of benefiting from the recent rise in interest rates contributing to historically high net income, and continued good credit quality metrics. Comprehensive income includes 1) net income as presented on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income and 2) other comprehensive income or loss from unrealized gains and losses on the Company&#8217;s available-for-sale investment securities portfolios and derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges as well as foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive income (loss) totaled a loss of $4.4 million for the third quarter of 2023 compared to a total loss of $72.7 million for the third quarter of 2022. 

The Company increased its loan portfolio from $38.2 billion at September 30, 2022 and $39.2 billion at December 31, 2022 to $41.4 billion at September 30, 2023. The increase in the current period compared to the prior periods was primarily a result of organic growth in several portfolios, including the commercial, commercial real estate, residential real estate loans held for investment portfolios, and property and casualty insurance premium finance receivable portfolios. For more information regarding changes in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio, see Financial Condition &#8211; Interest Earning Assets and Note (6) &#8220;Loans&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report. 

The Company recorded net interest income of $462.4 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $401.4 million in the third quarter of 2022. This increase in net interest income recorded in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 resulted primarily from growth in earning assets, specifically a $3.3 billion increase in average loans, and a significant increase in net interest margin. Net interest margin of 3.60% (3.62% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) in the third quarter of 2023 compared favorably to 3.34% (3.35% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher yields on earning assets, most notably loans held-for-investment, as market interest rates increased (see &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221; for further detail). 

Non-interest income totaled $112.5 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $101.5 million in the third quarter of 2022. The overall increase is due to an increase in fees from covered call options by $2.8 million in third quarter of 2023 compared to third quarter of 2022 and operating lease income of $13.9 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $12.6 million in the third quarter of 2022 (see &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; for further detail). 

Non-interest expense totaled $330.1 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $33.6 million, or 11%, compared to the third quarter of 2022. This increase compared to the third quarter of 2022 was primarily attributable to increased salaries and employee benefits of $16.2 million, increased occupancy expenses of $3.6 million, increased data processing of $3.0 million, and increased FDIC insurance of $2.6 million related to the rate increase at the beginning of 2023 (see &#8220;Non-Interest Expense&#8221; for further detail). 

Management considers the maintenance of adequate liquidity to be important to the management of risk. Accordingly, during the third quarter of 2023, the Company continued its practice of maintaining appropriate funding capacity to provide the Company with adequate liquidity for its ongoing operations. In this regard, the Company benefited from its strong deposit base, a liquid short-term investment portfolio and its access to funding from a variety of external funding sources. See &#8220;Deposits&#8221; and &#8220;Other Funding Sources&#8221; for additional information regarding liquidity sources.

(1) See following section titled &#8220;Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures/Ratios&#8221; for additional information on this performance measure/ratio. 

(2) Net revenue is net interest income plus non-interest income. 

(3) The net overhead ratio is calculated by netting total non-interest expense and total non-interest income, annualizing this amount, and dividing by that period&#8217;s total average assets. A lower ratio indicates a higher degree of efficiency. 

Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, and quarterly growth rates are &#8220;annualized&#8221; throughout this report to represent an annual time period. This is done for analytical purposes to better discern for decision-making purposes underlying performance 

trends when compared to full-year or year-over-year amounts. For example, balance sheet growth rates are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate. As such, 5% growth during a quarter would represent an annualized growth rate of 20%. 

SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES/RATIOS 

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company&#8217;s performance. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components), taxable-equivalent net interest margin (including its individual components), the taxable-equivalent efficiency ratio, tangible common equity ratio, tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible common equity and pre-tax income, excluding provision for credit losses. Management believes that these measures and ratios provide users of the Company&#8217;s financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the Company&#8217;s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and of the Company&#8217;s operating efficiency. Other financial holding companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently. 

Management reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent (&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis using tax rates effective as of the end of the period. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is also used in the calculation of the Company&#8217;s efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by total taxable-equivalent net revenue (less securities gains or losses), measures how much it costs to produce one dollar of revenue. Securities gains or losses are excluded from this calculation to better match revenue from daily operations to operational expenses. Management considers the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share as useful measurements of the Company&#8217;s equity. The Company references the return on average tangible common equity as a measurement of profitability. Management considers pre-tax income, excluding provision for credit losses as a useful measurement of the Company&#8217;s core net income. 

A reconciliation of certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios used by the Company to evaluate and measure the Company&#8217;s performance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is shown below:

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States, prevailing practices of the banking industry, and the application of accounting policies of which are described in Note (1) &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to 

variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s future financial condition and results of operations. At September 30, 2023, management views critical accounting estimates to include the determination of the allowance for credit losses, estimations of fair value, the valuations required for impairment testing of goodwill, the valuation and accounting for derivative instruments and income taxes as the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. These estimates were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 

Allowance for Credit Losses, including the Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowance for Losses on Lending-Related Commitments and Allowance for Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities 

The allowance for credit losses represents management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses over the life of a financial asset carried at amortized cost. Determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the fair value of the underlying collateral and amount and timing of expected future cash flows on individually assessed financial assets, estimated credit losses on pools of loans with similar risk characteristics, and consideration of reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic conditions, all of which are susceptible to significant change. At September 30, 2023, the loan and held-to-maturity debt securities portfolios represent 82% of the total assets on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. The Company also maintains an allowance for lending-related commitments, specifically unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, which relates to certain amounts the Company is committed to lend (not unconditionally cancelable) but for which funds have not yet been disbursed. 

Key macroeconomic variable data points that are significant inputs into our credit loss models for the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios are the Baa corporate credit spread as well as CREPI specifically related to the commercial real estate portfolio. Holding all other inputs constant, the table below shows the impact of changes in these key macroeconomic variable data points on the estimate of allowance for credit losses. 

Impact to estimated allowance for credit losses from an increased or higher input value Baa Credit Spread Increases CRE Price Index Decreases 

Holding all other inputs constant, the following table provides a sensitivity analysis for the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios based on a 20 basis point change in Baa credit spreads from the assumption utilized in the estimate of that portfolio&#8217;s allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2023:

Holding all other inputs constant, the following table provides a sensitivity analysis for the commercial real estate construction and non-construction portfolios based on a 10% change in CREPI from the assumption utilized in the estimate of that portfolio&#8217;s allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2023: 

CRE Price Index Increases Decreases Commercial Real Estate: Construction Decreases estimate by 50%-55% Increases estimate by 95%-100% Non-Construction Decreases estimate by 25%-30% Increases estimate by 60%-65% 

See Note (7) &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report and the section titled &#8220;Credit Quality&#8221; in Item 2 of this report for a description of the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses. 

For a more detailed discussion on these critical accounting estimates, see &#8220;Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; beginning on page 54 of the 2022 Form 10-K. 

Net Income 

Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 totaled $164.2 million, an increase of $21.2 million, or 15%, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2022. On a per share basis, net income for the third quarter of 2023 totaled $2.53 per diluted common share compared to $2.21 for the third quarter of 2022. 

The increase in net income for the third quarter of 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily attributable to increased net interest income and increased fees from covered call options, partially offset by higher salaries, occupancy and insurance expenses. See &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221;, &#8220;Non-interest Income&#8221;, &#8220;Non-interest Expense&#8221; and &#8220;Credit Quality&#8221; for further detail. 

Net Interest Income 

The primary source of the Company&#8217;s revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on the liabilities to fund those assets, including interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings. The amount of net interest income is affected by both changes in the level of interest rates, and the amount and composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. 

Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 compared to the Quarters Ended June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 

The following table presents a summary of the Company&#8217;s average balances, net interest income and related net interest margins, including a calculation on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, for the third quarter of 2023 as compared to the second quarter of 2023 (sequential quarters) and third quarter of 2022 (linked quarters):

Notable contributions to the change in non-interest income are as follows: 

Mortgage banking revenue increased slightly for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 and decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022. On a year-to-date basis, the decrease was a result of a reduction in loans originated for sale and lower net revenue related to MSR activity and valuation adjustments. Mortgage banking revenue includes revenue from activities related to originating, selling and servicing residential real estate loans for the secondary market. A main factor in the mortgage banking revenue recognized by the Company is the volume of mortgage loans originated or purchased for sale. Mortgage loans originated for sale totaled $572.6 million in the third quarter of 2023 as compared to $660.7 million in the third quarter of 2022. On a year-to-date basis, mortgage loans originated for sale totaled $1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $2.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in originations for the comparative nine month period was primarily due to rising interest rates reducing refinance incentives for borrowers. The percentage of origination volume from refinancing activities was 16% and 17% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, as compared to 18% and 31%, for the same periods in 2022, respectively. 

The Company records MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the fair value of the MSRs portfolio increased as a favorable fair value adjustment of $4.7 million was recorded as well as r etained servicing rights led to capitalization of $9.7 million, partially offset by a reduction in value of $4.8 million due to payoffs and paydowns of the existing portfolio. On a year-to-date basis, the fair value of MSRs portfolio decreased due to a reduction in value of $13.8 million due to payoffs and paydowns of the existing portfolio and a bulk sale of MSRs of $30.2 million, partially offset by retained servicing rights led to capitalization of $23.5 million and a favorable fair value adjustment of $485,000. See Note (9) &#8220;Mortgage Servicing Rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;)&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report for a summary of the changes in the carrying value of MSRs. 

Mortgage banking revenue is also impacted by changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company&#8217;s MSRs portfolio. The change in fair value of the derivative contracts held as an economic hedge was an unfavorable $2.5 million and $2.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

The Company has typically written call options with terms of less than three months against certain U.S. Treasury and agency securities held in its portfolio for liquidity and other purposes. Management has effectively entered into these transactions with 

the goal of economically hedging security positions and enhancing its overall return on its investment portfolio. These option transactions are designed to increase the total return associated with holding certain investment securities and do not qualify as hedges pursuant to accounting guidance. There were no outstanding call option contracts at September 30, 2023 and 2022. 

Operating lease income increased in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of additional lease rental income due to growth in leased assets as compared to the third quarter of 2022, and on a year-to-date basis the decreased income was a result of fewer gains on the sale of leased assets recorded in 2023 as compared to 2022. 

Miscellaneous non-interest income includes loan servicing fees, income from other investments, and other fees. This category of income increased $3.8 million and $12.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 2022. The increased income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to decreased contingent consideration accrued in the third quarter of 2023 related to previous acquisitions and higher fee income earned on card-related arrangements, letters of credit and other commitments. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, a $2.5 million loss was recorded related to the sale of property no longer considered for future expansion.

Notable contributions to the change in non-interest expense are as follows: 

Salaries and employee benefits expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same periods in 2022. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily related to increased staffing and related costs as the Company grows. This period also included other salary costs from severance charges and other contractually due compensation costs totaling approximately $1.6 million. On a year-to-date basis, the increase was primarily related to higher staffing and related costs as the Company grows, partially offset by decreased commissions and incentive compensation as a result of lower commission expense related to declining mortgage production in the 2023. 

Software and equipment expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same periods in 2022 as a result of higher software license fees as well as higher computer and software depreciation expense as the Company invests in enhancements to the digital customer experience, upgrades to infrastructure and enhancements to information security capabilities. 

Operating lease equipment cost increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 due to growth in the Company&#8217;s operating lease assets as well as impairment totaling $1.5 million of certain assets during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Occupancy expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized impairment totaling $2.9 million of two Company-owned buildings that are no longer being used. Additionally, on a year-to-date basis, the increase was partly attributable to lower rental income from the Company&#8217;s office space available for lease as well as higher maintenance, repairs and other costs at the Company&#8217;s owned properties. 

Data processing expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred additional costs due to the termination of a duplicate service contract related to the acquisition of a wealth management business in 2023. Additionally, on a year-to-date basis, the increase was primarily attributable to additional costs from certain system conversion processes completed in 2023. 

FDIC insurance expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 as a result of the FDIC&#8217;s increase of the basis rate beginning with the first quarterly assessment period in 2023 and asset growth. 

Miscellaneous expense includes ATM expenses, correspondent bank charges, directors&#8217; fees, telephone, postage, corporate insurance, dues and subscriptions, problem loan expenses and other miscellaneous operational losses and costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, miscellaneous expense increased as a result of interest payments made on collateral received for outstanding interest rate derivative contracts. 

Income Taxes 

The Company recorded income tax expense of $60.7 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $57.1 million in the third quarter of 2022. The effective tax rates were 26.98% in the third quarter of 2023 compared to 28.53% in the third quarter of 2022. During the first nine months of 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of $180.7 million compared to $140.5 million for the first nine months of 2022. The effective tax rates were 26.58% for the first nine months of 2023 and 27.80% for the first nine months of 2022. 

The effective tax rates were partially impacted by an overall higher level of pretax net income in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 as well as the impact related to the Company recording an approximate $2.0 million GILTI tax liability in the third quarter of 2022. The effective tax rates were also partially impacted by the tax effects related to share-based compensation which fluctuate based on the Company&#8217;s stock price and timing of employee stock option exercises and vesting of other shared-based awards. The Company recorded net excess tax benefits of $2.9 million in the first nine months of 2023, compared to net excess tax benefits of $2.4 million in the first nine months of 2022 related to share-based compensation, most of which was recorded in the first quarter of each year. 

Operating Segment Results 

The Company&#8217;s operations consist of three primary segments: community banking, specialty finance and wealth management. Refer to Note (13) &#8220;Segment Information&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report for further information on the Company&#8217;s primary segments. The Company&#8217;s profitability is primarily dependent on the net interest income, provision for credit losses, non-interest income and operating expenses of its community banking segment. 

The community banking segment&#8217;s net interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 totaled $360.6 million as compared to $319.9 million for the same period in 2022, an increase of $40.6 million, or 13%. On a year-to-date basis, net interest income for the segment increased by $266.4 million from $810.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the three and nine month period was primarily attributable to increased interest and fees on loans due to loan growth and increased interest rates, partially offset by increased interest expense on deposit s. The community banking segment&#8217;s non-interest income totaled $70.5 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $9.9 million, or 16%, when compared to the third quarter of 2022 total of $60.6 million. On a year-to-date basis, non-interest income totaled $207.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , a decrease of $37.8 million , or 15%, compared to $245.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in the nine month period was primarily the result of reduced mortgage banking revenue due to lower originations for sale and lower net revenue related to MSR activity and valuation adjustments. The community banking segment recorded provision for credit losses of $16.7 million and $64.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $3.6 million and $28.0 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2022. The increase in provision for credit losses for the three and nine month period was primarily due to deterioration in the macroeconomic forecasts and loan growth. The community banking segment&#8217;s net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 totaled $115.2 million, an increase of $10.5 million as compared to net income in the third quarter of 2022 of $104.7 million. On a year-to-date basis, the net income of the community banking segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled $351.9 million as compared to $249.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

The specialty finance segment&#8217;s net interest income totaled $85.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to $64.1 million for the same period in 2022, an increase of $21.3 million, or 33%. On a year-to-date basis, net interest income for the segment increased $62.6 million, or 35% compared to the same period in 2022. The increase for the three and nine month period was primarily due to loan growth and increased interest rates on the premium finance receivables portfolios. The specialty finance segment&#8217;s non-interest income decreased to $20.8 million from $23.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and stood at $78.3 million and $72.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our property and casualty insurance premium finance operations, life insurance finance operations, lease financing operations and accounts receivable finance operations accounted for 55%, 24%, 3% and 18%, respectively, of the total revenues of our specialty finance business for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. The net income of the specialty finance segment for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 totaled $40.5 million as compared to $27.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. On a year-to-date basis, the net income of the specialty finance 

segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled $123.7 million as compared to $87.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

The wealth management segment reported net interest income of $8.0 million for the third quarter of 2023 compared to $9.6 million in the same quarter of 2022, an decrease of $1.6 million, or 17%. On a year-to-date basis, net interest income totaled $24.4 million for the first nine months of 2023, as compared to $27.5 million for the first nine months of 2022. Net interest income for this segment is primarily comprised of an allocation of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing wealth management customer account balances on deposit at the banks. Wealth management customer account balances on deposit at the banks averaged $1.7 billion and $2.8 billion in the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. This segment recorded non-interest income of $37.3 million for the third quarter of 2023 compared to $32.5 million for the third quarter of 2022. On a year-to-date basis, this segment recorded non-interest income of $101.0 million for the first nine months of 2023 as compared to $93.3 million for the first nine months of 2022. Distribution of wealth management services through each bank continues to be a focus of the Company. The Company is committed to growing the wealth management segment in order to better service its customers and create a more diversified revenue stream. The wealth management segment&#8217;s net income totaled $8.5 million for the third quarter of 2023 compared to $11.1 million for the third quarter of 2022. On a year-to-date basis, the wealth management segment&#8217;s net income totaled $23.6 million and $28.1 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Financial Condition 

Total assets were $55.6 billion at September 30, 2023, representing an increase of $3.2 billion, or 6%, when compared to September 30, 2022 and an increase of approximately $1.3 billion, or 9% on an annualized basis, when compared to June 30, 2023. Total funding, which includes deposits, all notes and advances, including secured borrowings and the junior subordinated debentures, was $48.7 billion at September 30, 2023, $47.4 billion at June 30, 2023, and $46.3 billion at September 30, 2022. See Notes (5), (6), (10), (11) and (12) of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for additional period-end detail on the Company&#8217;s interest-earning assets and funding liabilities.

(2) Liquidity management assets include investment securities, other securities, interest earning deposits with banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements. 

(3) Other earning assets include brokerage customer receivables and trading account securities. 

Mortgage loans held-for-sale. Mortgage loans held-for-sale represents such loans awaiting subsequent sale in the secondary market with such sales eliminating the interest-rate risk associated with these loans, as they are predominantly long-term fixed rate loans, and provide a source of non-interest revenue. The decrease in average balance from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to lower mortgage origination production due primarily to higher interest rates as well as the transfer to held-for-investment classification of certain loans previously repurchased by the Company under the early buyout option available for loans sold to GNMA with servicing retained. See below for additional discussion of these early buyout options. 

Loans, net of unearned income. Growth realized in the combined commercial and commercial real estate loan categories for the third quarter of 2023 as compared to the sequential and prior year periods is primarily attributable to increased business development efforts. The aggregate balances of these loan categories comprised 57% of the average loan portfolio in the third quarter of 2023, second quarter of 2023 and third quarter of 2022. 

The increase in the residential real estate average balance compared to both periods was partially due to the Company deciding to allocate more balances from its mortgage production for investment instead of for subsequent sale and servicing in the secondary market. The residential real estate loan portfolio includes certain loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies under the Government National Mortgage Association (&#8220;GNMA&#8221;) optional repurchase programs. Such programs allow financial institutions acting as servicers to buyout individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the institution was the original transferor of such loans. At the option of the servicer and without prior authorization from GNMA, the servicer may repurchase such delinquent loans for an amount equal to the remaining principal balance of the loan. Under FASB ASC Topic 860, &#8220;Transfers and Servicing,&#8221; this early buyout option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met, at which time the option becomes unconditional. When the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans under the unconditional repurchase option and the expected benefit of the potential repurchase is more than trivial, the loans can no longer be reported as sold and must be brought back onto the balance sheet as loans at fair value, regardless of whether the Company intends to exercise the early buyout option. These rebooked loans are reported as loans held-for-investment, part of the residential real estate portfolio, with the offsetting liability being reported in accrued interest payable and other liabilities. When the early buyout option on these rebooked GNMA loans is exercised, the repurchased loans continue to be carried at fair value. Additionally, such loans typically transfer to mortgage loans held-for-sale at the time of early buyout as the Company&#8217;s intent is to cure and resell such loans subsequent to repurchase from GNMA. If such intent to cure and resell changes subsequent to early buyout, the Company reclassifies such loans as held-for-investment. Early buyout loans classified as held-for-investment totaled $169.0 million at September 30, 2023 compared to $148.7 million at September 30, 2022. Such loans consist of both the rebooked GNMA loans and the early buyout exercised loans classified as held-for-investment discussed above. Rebooked GNMA loans held-for-investment amounted to $97.9 million at September 30, 2023, compared to $57.2 million at September 30, 2022. The increase in balance from September 30, 2022 to September 30, 2023 was the result of higher delinquencies between periods and less frequent exercising of the early buyout option by the Company. As of September 30, 2023, early buyout exercised loans held-for-investment totaled $71.1 million compared to $91.5 million as of September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, early buyout exercised mortgage loans held-for-sale totaled $114.3 million compared to $160.1 million as of September 30, 2022. The decline in early buyout exercised mortgage loans held-for-sale relative to the prior year is primarily due to the resale of mortgage loans to GNMA as well as the reclassification of certain loans to held-for-investment classification due to an inability to resell due to continued delinquency. 

The increase in the premium finance receivables during the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 was the result of continued originations within the portfolio due to hardening insurance market conditions driving a higher average size of new property and casualty insurance premium finance receivables as well as effective marketing and customer servicing. Approximately $4.6 billion of premium finance receivables were originated in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $4.1 billion during the same period of 2022. Premium finance receivables consist of a property and casualty portfolio and a life portfolio comprising approximately 46% and 54%, respectively, of the average total balance of premium finance receivables for the third quarter of 2023, and 42% and 58%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2022. 

Other loans represent a wide variety of personal and consumer loans to individuals. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk due to the type and nature of the collateral. 

Liquidity management assets. Funds that are not utilized for loan originations are used to purchase investment securities and short term money market investments, to sell as federal funds and to maintain in interest bearing deposits with banks. The balances of these assets can fluctuate based on management&#8217;s ongoing effort to manage liquidity and for asset liability management purposes. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate and utilize liquidity sources as needed, including the management of availability with the FHLB and FRB and utilization of the revolving credit facility with unaffiliated banks.

With its transition from LIBOR, the Company increased the portion of its loan portfolio with interest rate indices that are an alternative to LIBOR during the period, including emerging indices such as SOFR, CMT, and Ameribor. As shown above, at September 30, 2023, variable rate loans priced at SOFR, CMT, and Ameribor totaled $12.8 billion, $6.0 billion and $329.2 million, respectively. Additionally, the last LIBOR tenors were scheduled to cease after June 30, 2023. As anticipated, these loans using 12-month LIBOR will remain statically priced until next repricing or maturity event. The percentage of the Company&#8217;s variable rate loans indexed to LIBOR decreased to nearly 0% at September 30, 2023 compared to 48% at September 30, 2022. The Company continues its transition of its loan portfolio from LIBOR for both loans existing at September 30, 2023 and future new originations.

Commercial and Commercial Real Estate Loan Portfolios 

Our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are comprised primarily of lines of credit for working capital purposes and commercial real estate loans. The table below sets forth information regarding the types and amounts of our loans within these portfolios as of September 30, 2023 and 2022:

We make commercial loans for many purposes, including working capital lines, which are generally renewable annually and supported by business assets, personal guarantees and additional collateral. Such loans may vary in size based on customer need. Primarily as a result of growth in the Company&#8217;s commercial loan portfolio our allowance for credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio increased to $151.5 million as of September 30, 2023 compared to $135.3 million as of September 30, 2022. 

Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by a first mortgage lien and assignment of rents on the property. Since most of our bank branches are located in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin, 70.3% of our commercial real estate loan portfolio is located in this region as of September 30, 2023. We have been able to effectively manage our total non-performing commercial real estate loans, aided by our credit management process. As of September 30, 2023, our allowance for credit losses related to this portfolio was $215.7 million compared to $150.7 million as of September 30, 2022 . The increase in the allowance for credit losses is primarily a result of growth in our commercial real estate portfolio as well as a deteriorated forecast in the CREPI macroeconomic variable. 

The Company also participates in mortgage warehouse lending, which is included above within commercial, industrial and other, by providing interim funding to unaffiliated mortgage bankers to finance residential mortgages originated by such bankers for sale into the secondary market. The Company&#8217;s loans to the mortgage bankers are secured by the business assets of the mortgage companies as well as the specific mortgage loans funded by the Company, after they have been pre-approved for purchase by third party end lenders. The Company may also provide interim financing for packages of mortgage loans on a bulk basis in circumstances where the mortgage bankers desire to competitively bid on a number of mortgages for sale as a package in the secondary market. Amounts advanced with respect to any particular mortgage loan are usually required to be repaid within 21 days. 

Past Due Loans and Non-Performing Assets 

Our ability to manage credit risk depends in large part on our ability to properly identify and manage problem loans. To do so, the Company operates a credit risk rating system under which our credit management personnel assigns a credit risk rating to each loan at the time of origination and review loans on a regular basis to determine each loan&#8217;s credit risk rating on a scale of 1 through 10 with higher scores indicating higher risk. Description of the Company&#8217;s credit risk rating structure used is included in Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the 2022 Form 10-K. 

If based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due to it according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, a loan is individually assessed for measuring the allowance for credit losses and, if necessary, a reserve is established. In determining the appropriate reserve for collateral-dependent loans, the Company considers the results of appraisals for the associated collateral. 

Loan Portfolio Aging 

As of September 30, 2023, excluding early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, $90.3 million, or 0.2% of all loans, were 60 to 89 days (or two payments) past due and $146.6 million, or 0.4% of all loans, were 30 to 59 days (or one payment) past due. As of June 30, 2023, excluding early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, $57.9 million, or 0.1% of all loans, were 60 to 89 days (or two payments) past due and $187.7 million, or 0.5% of all loans, were 30 to 59 days (or one payment) past due. Many of the commercial and commercial real estate loans shown as 60 to 89 days and 30 to 59 days past due are included on the Company&#8217;s internal problem loan reporting system. Loans on this system are closely monitored by management on a monthly basis. The Company's home equity and residential loan portfolios continue to exhibit low delinquency ratios. Home equity loans at September 30, 2023 that were current with regard to the contractual terms of the loan agreement represent 99.1% of the total home equity portfolio. Residential real estate loans, excluding early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, at September 30, 2023 that were current with regards to the contractual terms of the loan agreements comprise 99.3% of total residential real estate loans outstanding. For more information regarding delinquent loans as of September 30, 2023, see Note (7) &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; in Item 1.

(1) Excludes early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. Early buy-out loans are insured or guaranteed by the FHA or the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, subject to indemnifications and insurance limits for certain loans. 

At this time, management believes reserves are appropriate to absorb losses that are expected upon the ultimate resolution of these credits. Significant increases may occur in subsequent periods due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and related impacts on borrowers. Management will continue to actively review and monitor its loan portfolios, in an effort to identify problem credits in a timely manner.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses, specifically the allowance for loans losses and the allowance for unfunded commitment losses, represents management&#8217;s estimate of lifetime expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is determined quarterly using a methodology that incorporates important risk characteristics of each loan. A description of how the Company determines the allowance for credit losses is included in Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the 2022 Form 10-K. 

Management determined that the allowance for credit losses was appropriate at September 30, 2023, and that the loan portfolio is well diversified and well secured, without undue concentration in any specific risk area. While this process involves a high degree of management judgment, the allowance for credit losses is based on a comprehensive, well documented, and consistently applied analysis of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. This analysis takes into consideration all available information existing as of the financial statement date, including environmental factors such as economic, industry, geographical and political factors, when considered applicable. The relative level of allowance for credit losses is reviewed and compared to industry peers. This review encompasses levels of total non-performing loans, portfolio mix, portfolio concentrations and overall levels of net charge-off. Historical trending of both the Company&#8217;s results and the industry peers is also reviewed to analyze comparative significance.

Other Real Estate Owned 

In certain circumstances, the Company is required to take action against the real estate collateral of specific loans. The Company uses foreclosure only as a last resort for dealing with borrowers experiencing financial hardships.

The following table sets forth, by category, the composition of average deposit balances and the relative percentage of total average deposits for the periods presented: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 (Dollars in thousands) Balance Percent Balance Percent Balance Percent Non-interest-bearing $ 10,612,009 &#160; 25 &#160; % $ 10,908,022 26 % $ 13,731,219 32 % NOW and interest-bearing demand deposits 5,815,155 &#160; 13 &#160; 5,540,597 13 5,789,368 14 Wealth management deposits 1,512,765 &#160; 3 &#160; 1,545,626 4 3,078,764 7 Money market 14,155,446 &#160; 32 &#160; 13,735,924 32 12,037,412 29 Savings 5,472,535 &#160; 12 &#160; 5,206,609 12 3,862,579 9 Time certificates of deposit 6,495,906 &#160; 15 &#160; 5,603,024 13 3,675,930 9 Total average deposits $ 44,063,816 &#160; 100 &#160; % $ 42,539,802 100 % $ 42,175,272 100 % 

Total average deposits for the third quarter of 2023 were $44.1 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion, or 4%, from the third quarter of 2022. Total deposits increased in the third quarter as the Company increased marketing efforts to retain and attract deposits to support continued loan growth. Additionally, the diversity of our deposit base showed its resilience in a volatile market. The Company has experienced a change in the mix of deposits as non-interest bearing deposits have migrated to interest-bearing products. 

Wealth management deposits are funds from the brokerage customers of Wintrust Investments, CDEC and trust and asset management customers of the Company which have been placed into deposit accounts of the banks (&#8220;wealth management deposits&#8221; in the table above). Wealth Management deposits consist primarily of money market accounts. Consistent with reasonable interest rate risk parameters, these funds have generally been invested in loan production of the banks as well as other investments suitable for banks. 

Brokered Deposits 

While the Company obtains a portion of its total deposits through brokered deposits, the Company does so primarily as an asset-liability management tool to assist in the management of interest rate risk, and the Company does not consider brokered deposits to be a vital component of its current liquidity resources. Historically, brokered deposits have represented a small component of the Company&#8217;s total deposits outstanding, as set forth in the table below: 

September 30, December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2022 2021 2020 Total deposits $ 44,992,686 &#160; $ 42,797,191 $ 42,902,544 $ 42,095,585 $ 37,092,651 Brokered deposits 3,693,997 &#160; 2,532,769 3,174,093 1,591,083 1,843,227 Brokered deposits as a percentage of total deposits 8.2 &#160; % 5.9 % 7.4 % 3.8 % 5.0 % 

Brokered deposits include certificates of deposit obtained through deposit brokers, deposits received through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Program, and certain deposits of brokerage customers from unaffiliated companies which have been placed into deposit accounts of the banks. 

Other Funding Sources 

Although deposits are the Company&#8217;s primary source of funding its interest-earning assets, the Company&#8217;s ability to manage the types and terms of deposits is somewhat limited by customer preferences and market competition. As a result, in addition to deposits and the issuance of equity securities and the retention of earnings, the Company uses several other funding sources to support its growth. These sources include FHLB advances, notes payable, short-term borrowings, secured borrowings, subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures. The Company evaluates the terms and unique characteristics of each source, as well as its asset-liability management position, in determining the use of such funding sources. 

Uninsured deposits are estimated based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Company&#8217;s regulatory reporting requirements. In accordance with the instructions described in the FDIC&#8217;s July 24, 2023 Financial Institution Letter to clarify Estimated Uninsured Deposits Reporting Expectations, the Company had approximately $15.3 billion of uninsured deposits as of September 30, 2023 of which $2.7 billion were fully collateralized deposits. The net position of $12.6 billion of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits represents approximately 28% of total deposits as of September 30, 2023. The Company had total 

liquidity sources, including cash and collateralized funding sources of $15.5 billion or approximately 124% of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits as of September 30, 2023. 

On March 12, 2023, the Federal Reserve established the Bank Term Funding Program (&#8220;BTFP&#8221;). The Company has registered for the BTFP but has not participated and does not intend to participate. However, this is an additional option as an available short-term liquidity source. 

The following table sets forth, by category, the composition of the average balances of other funding sources for the quarterly periods presented: 

Three Months Ended September 30, June 30, September 30, (In thousands) 2023 2023 2022 FHLB advances $ 2,241,292 &#160; $ 2,227,106 $ 1,403,573 Other borrowings: Notes payable

Notes payable balances represent the balances on a credit agreement with certain unaffiliated banks. As of September 30, 2023, the outstanding principal balance under the term loan facility was $178.4 million and there was no outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility. 

The balance of secured borrowings primarily represents a third party Canadian transaction (&#8220;Canadian Secured Borrowing&#8221;). Under the Canadian Secured Borrowing, the Company, through its subsidiary, FIFC Canada, sells an undivided co-ownership interest in all receivables owed to FIFC Canada to an unrelated third party in exchange for cash payments pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement (&#8220;Receivables Purchase Agreement&#8221;). On May 31, 2023, the Company entered into the eleventh amending agreement to the Receivables Purchase Agreement dated as of December 16, 2014. The amended Receivables Purchase Agreement provides for, among other things, an extension of the maturity date to December 15, 2024, an increase to the facility limit from $420 million to $520 million, and a fee rate increase from 0.775% to 0.825%. Additionally, since CDOR will cease being used in Canada in June 2024, references to CDOR changed to the Benchmark rate. 

See Note (11) &#8220;FHLB Advances, Other Borrowings and Subordinated Notes&#8221; and Note (12) &#8220;Junior Subordinated Debentures&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for details of period end balances and other information for these various funding sources. The Company hereby incorporates by reference Note (11) and Note (12) of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report in its entirety. 

Shareholders&#8217; Equity 

The following tables reflect various consolidated measures of capital as of the dates presented and the capital guidelines established for a bank holding company: 

September 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Tier 1 leverage ratio 9.2 &#160; % 9.3 % 8.8 % Risk-based capital ratios: Tier 1 capital ratio 10.2 &#160; 10.1 9.9 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 9.3 &#160; 9.3 9.0 Total capital ratio 12.0 &#160; 12.0 11.8 Other ratio:

(1) Reflects the Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5%. 

(2) Reflects the well-capitalized standard applicable to the Company for purposes of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation Y. The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies (&#8220;BHCs&#8221;) to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the U.S. Basel III Rule or to add Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio requirements to this standard. As a result, the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio are denoted as &#8220;N/A&#8221; in this column. If the Federal Reserve were to apply the same or a very similar well-capitalized standard to BHCs as the standard applicable to our subsidiary banks, we believe the Company&#8217;s capital ratios as of September 30, 2023 would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard. 

The Company&#8217;s principal sources of funds at the holding company level are dividends from its subsidiaries, borrowings under its loan agreement with unaffiliated banks and proceeds from the issuances of subordinated debt and additional equity. Refer to Notes (11) and (12) of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 for further information on these various funding sources. See Note (23) &#8220;Shareholders&#8217; Equity&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 7 of the 2022 Form 10-K for details on the Company&#8217;s issuance of Series D Preferred Stock in June 2015, Series E Preferred Stock and associated Depositary Shares in May 2020 and additional common stock offering in June 2022. 

The Board of Directors approves dividends from time to time, however, the ability to declare a dividend is limited by the Company&#8217;s financial condition, the terms of the Company&#8217;s Series D and Series E Preferred Stock, the terms of the Company&#8217;s Trust Preferred Securities offerings and under certain financial covenants in the Company&#8217;s revolving and term facilities. In January, April, and July of 2023, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per common share. In January, April, July and October of 2022, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.34 per common share. 

The Company continues to leverage its capital management framework to assess and monitor risk when making capital decisions. Management is committed to maintaining the Company&#8217;s capital levels above the &#8220;Well Capitalized&#8221; levels established by the FRB for bank holding companies. 

LIQUIDITY 

The Company manages the liquidity position of its banking operations to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet customers&#8217; needs for loans and deposit withdrawals. The management process includes the utilization of stress testing processes and other aspects of the Company's liquidity management framework to assess and monitor risk, and inform decision making. The liquidity to meet the demands of customers is provided by maturing assets, liquid assets that can be converted to cash and the ability to attract funds from external sources. Liquid assets refer to money market assets such as Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks, as well as available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are not pledged to secure public funds. In addition, trade date receivables represent certain sales or calls of available-for-sale securities that await cash settlement, typically in the month following the trade date. 

In addition to the liquidity management noted above, in the third quarter of 2023, the Company completed a loan sale transaction within our property and casualty insurance premium finance receivables portfolio which demonstrated that our premium finance portfolio is a strong source of additional liquidity if needed and demonstrated the flexibility to continue to manage our balance sheet effectively. Net proceeds to the Company totaled approximately $405.6 million and a gain on the sale was recorded for approximately $890,000. In 2022, the Company sold a total of 3,450,000 shares of its common stock through a public offering. Net proceeds to the Company totaled approximately $285.7 million, net of estimated issuance costs. We maintain our liquid assets to ensure that we would have the balance sheet strength to serve our clients. As a result, the Company believes that it has sufficient funds and access to funds to effectively meet its working capital and other needs. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate liquidity sources, including the management of availability with the FHLB and FRB and utilization of the revolving credit facility with unaffiliated banks. Please refer to Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of 

Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Interest-Earning Assets, -Deposits, -Other Funding Sources and -Shareholders&#8217; Equity sections of this report for additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s liquidity position. 

INFLATION 

A banking organization&#8217;s assets and liabilities are primarily monetary. Changes in the rate of inflation typically do not have as great an impact on the financial condition of a bank as do changes in interest rates. Moreover, interest rates do not necessarily change at the same percentage as inflation. Accordingly, changes in inflation are not expected to have as material an impact on the Company&#8217;s business as entities operating in other industries. An analysis of the Company&#8217;s asset and liability structure provides the best indication of how the organization is positioned to respond to changing interest rates. See &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; section of this report for additional information.
