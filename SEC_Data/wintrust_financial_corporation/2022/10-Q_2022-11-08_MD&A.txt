MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition of Wintrust Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, &#8220;Wintrust&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of September 30, 2022 compared with December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021, and the results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes contained in this report and the risk factors discussed under Item 1A of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (&#8220;2021 Form 10-K&#8221;) and in Part II, Item 1A, of this Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and, as such, future results could differ significantly from management&#8217;s current expectations. See the last section of this discussion for further information on forward-looking statements.

Overview 

Impact of COVID-19 

In March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, resulting in unprecedented uncertainty and volatility in world-wide financial markets. Despite the widespread distribution of vaccines and related boosters, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the continued emergence of variant strains of the virus, may impact the Company's future results. Please refer to Part II, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (&#8220;CARES&#8221;) Act was enacted. The CARES Act includes appropriations and other measures designed to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;), which was designed to aid eligible small and medium-sized businesses through federally-guaranteed loans distributed through certain banks, under the administration of the Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;). From the date the Company began accepting applications, April 3, 2020, through June 30, 2021, the Company secured authorization from the SBA and funded over 19,400 PPP loans, which are forgivable under certain circumstances, with a carrying balance of approximately $4.8 billion. From the loans originated under the program, the Company generated net fees of $146.0 million, of which $144.4 million has been recognized through September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2022 the carrying balance of such loans was reduced to approximately $43.7 million primarily resulting from forgiveness by the SBA. 

Third Quarter Highlights 

The Company recorded net income of $143.0 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $109.1 million in the third quarter of 2021. The results for the third quarter of 2022 demonstrate continued momentum on our operating strengths and core fundamentals, including continued expansion of net interest income as a result of benefiting from the recent rise in interest rates, significant organic loan growth diversified across the portfolio and good credit quality metrics. Additionally, volatility in the interest rate environment resulted in significant negative fair value adjustments to the Company&#8217;s available-for-sale investment securities and derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges portfolios, and a corresponding significant negative adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. As a result, comprehensive income (loss) totaled a loss of $72.7 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to a total income of $100.4 million for the third quarter of 2021. Comprehensive loss includes 1) net income as presented on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income and 2) other comprehensive income or loss from unrealized gains and losses on the Company&#8217;s available-for-sale investment securities portfolios and derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges as well as foreign currency translation adjustments. 

The Company increased its loan portfolio from $33.3 billion at September 30, 2021 and $34.8 billion at December 31, 2021 to $38.2 billion at September 30, 2022. The increase in the current period compared to the prior periods was primarily a result of organic growth in several portfolios, including the commercial, industrial and other (excluding PPP loans), commercial real estate, residential real estate loans held for investment, property and casualty insurance premium finance receivable and life insurance premium finance receivables portfolios. For more information regarding changes in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio, 

see Financial Condition &#8211; Interest Earning Assets and Note 6 - Loans of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report. 

The Company recorded net interest income of $401.4 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $287.5 million in the third quarter of 2021. This increase in net interest income recorded in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021 resulted primarily from growth in earning assets, specifically a $4.4 billion increase in average loans, and a significant increase in net interest margin. Net interest margin of 3.34% (3.35% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) in the third quarter of 2022 compared favorably to 2.58% (2.59% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to higher yields on earning assets, most notably loans held-for-investment, as interest rates increased in the market (see &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221; for further detail). 

Non-interest income totaled $101.5 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $136.5 million in the third quarter of 2021. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in mortgage banking revenues due to origination volumes declining from historically elevated levels experienced in early 2021. (see &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; for further detail). 

Non-interest expense totaled $296.5 million in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $14.3 million, or 5%, compared to the third quarter of 2021. The increase compared to the third quarter of 2021 was primarily attributable to higher salaries and benefits, higher advertising and marketing expense related to seasonal media advertising and sponsorship costs and higher miscellaneous expense partially offset by lower commissions due to lower mortgage loan originations (see &#8220;Non-Interest Expense&#8221; for further detail). 

Management considers the maintenance of adequate liquidity to be important to the management of risk. Accordingly, during the third quarter of 2022, the Company continued its practice of maintaining appropriate funding capacity to provide the Company with adequate liquidity for its ongoing operations. In this regard, the Company benefited from its strong deposit base, a liquid short-term investment portfolio and its access to funding from a variety of external funding sources. At September 30, 2022, the Company had approximately $4.5 billion in overnight liquid funds and interest-bearing deposits with banks.

(1) See following section titled, &#8220;Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures/Ratios&#8221; for additional information on this performance measure/ratio. 

(2) Net revenue is net interest income plus non-interest income. 

(3) The net overhead ratio is calculated by netting total non-interest expense and total non-interest income, annualizing this amount, and dividing by that period&#8217;s total average assets. A lower ratio indicates a higher degree of efficiency. 

Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, and quarterly growth rates are &#8220;annualized&#8221; throughout this report to represent an annual time period. This is done for analytical purposes to better discern for decision-making purposes underlying performance trends when compared to full-year or year-over-year amounts. For example, balance sheet growth rates are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate. As such, 5% growth during a quarter would represent an annualized growth rate of 20%. 

SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES/RATIOS 

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company&#8217;s performance. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components), taxable-equivalent net interest margin (including its individual components), the taxable-equivalent efficiency ratio, tangible common equity ratio, tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible common equity, pre-tax income, excluding provision for credit losses and pre-tax income, excluding provision for credit losses, adjusted for changes in the fair value of MSRs, net of economic hedge and early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. Management believes that these measures and ratios provide users of the Company&#8217;s financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the Company&#8217;s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and of the Company&#8217;s operating efficiency. Other financial holding companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently. 

Management reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent (&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis using tax rates effective as of the end of the period. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is also used in the calculation of the Company&#8217;s efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by total taxable-equivalent net revenue (less securities gains or losses), measures how much it costs to produce one dollar of revenue. Securities gains or losses are excluded from this calculation to better match revenue from daily operations to operational expenses. Management considers the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share as useful measurements of the Company&#8217;s equity. The Company references the return on average tangible common equity as a measurement of profitability. Management considers pre-tax income, excluding provision for credit losses, and pre-tax income, excluding provision for credit losses, adjusted for changes in the fair value of MSRs, net of economic hedge and early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, as useful measurements of the Company&#8217;s core net income. 

A reconciliation of certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios used by the Company to evaluate and measure the Company&#8217;s performance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is shown below:

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States and prevailing practices of the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Certain policies and accounting principles inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments, and as such have a greater possibility that changes in those estimates and assumptions could produce financial results that are materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event, are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates and assumptions. Management views critical accounting estimates to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions, and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the financial statements. Management currently views critical accounting estimates to include the determination of the allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for loan losses, the allowance for unfunded commitment losses and the allowance for held-to-maturity securities losses, estimations of fair value, the valuations required for impairment testing of goodwill, the valuation and accounting for derivative instruments and income taxes as the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments, and as such could be the most subject to revision as new information becomes available. For a more detailed discussion on these critical accounting estimates, see &#8220;Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; beginning on page 55 of the Company&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K. 

Net Income 

Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 totaled $143.0 million, an increase of $33.8 million, or 31%, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2021. On a per share basis, net income for the third quarter of 2022 totaled $2.21 per diluted common share compared to $1.77 for the third quarter of 2021. 

The increase in net income for the third quarter of 2022 as compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily attributable to increased net interest income, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue. See &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221;, &#8220;Non-interest Income&#8221;, &#8220;Non-interest Expense&#8221; and &#8220;Loan Portfolio and Asset Quality&#8221; for further detail. 

Net Interest Income 

The primary source of the Company&#8217;s revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on the liabilities to fund those assets, including interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings. The amount of net interest income is affected by both changes in the level of interest rates, and the amount and composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.

Notable contributions to the change in non-interest income are as follows: 

Wealth management revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same periods in 2021 due to an increase in trust and asset management fees. Trust and asset management fees are based primarily on the market value of the assets under management or administration as well as the volume of tax-deferred like-kind exchange services provided during a period. Such revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily as a result of increased activity in the tax-deferred like-kind exchange services provided as compared to the same periods in 2021. Wealth management revenue is comprised of the trust and asset management revenue of The Chicago Trust Company and Great Lakes Advisors, the brokerage commissions, managed money fees and insurance product commissions of Wintrust Investments and fees from tax-deferred like-kind exchange services provided by the Chicago Deferred Exchange Company. 

Mortgage banking revenue decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same periods in 2021 as a result of a decrease in loans originated for sale and lower production margins, partially offset by more favorable fair value adjustments of MSRs. Mortgage loans originated for sale totaled $660.7 million in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2021. On a year-to-date basis, mortgage loans originated for sale totaled $2.4 billion for nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to $5.5 billion for nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in originations was primarily due to rising interest rates reducing refinance incentives for borrowers. Mortgage banking revenue includes revenue from activities related to originating, selling and servicing residential real estate loans for the secondary market. A main factor in the mortgage banking revenue recognized by the Company is the volume of mortgage loans originated or purchased for sale. 

The Company records MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, the fair value of the MSRs portfolio increased due to a favorable fair value adjustment of $9.8 million as well as retained servicing rights led to capitalization of $13.3 million, partially offset by a reduction in value of $6.0 million due to payoffs and paydowns of the existing portfolio. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the fair value of the MSRs portfolio increased due to a favorable fair value adjustment of $62.3 million as well as retained servicing rights led to capitalization of $38.9 million, partially offset by a reduction in value of $18.9 million due to payoffs and paydowns of the existing portfolio. 

Mortgage banking revenue is also impacted by changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company&#8217;s MSRs portfolio. The change in fair value of the derivative contracts held as an economic hedge for both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2022 was $2.3 million. 

The table below presents additional selected information regarding mortgage banking for the respective periods.

(1) Production revenue represents revenue earned from the origination and subsequent sale of mortgages, including gains on loans sold and fees from originations, changes in other related financial instruments carried at fair value, processing and other related activities, and excludes servicing fees, changes in the fair value of servicing rights and changes to the mortgage recourse obligation and other non-production revenue. 

(2) Certain volume adjusted for the estimated pull-through rate of the loan, which represents the Company&#8217;s best estimate of the likelihood that a committed loan will ultimately fund. 

Service charges on deposits increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same periods in 2021 as a result of higher account analysis fees on deposit accounts which increased as a result of the Company&#8217;s commercial banking initiatives. Service charges on deposit accounts include fees charged to deposit customers for various services, including account analysis services, and are based on factors such as the size and type of customer, type of product and number of transactions. The fees are based on a standard schedule of fees and, depending on the nature of the service performed, the service is performed at a point in time or over a period of a month. 

The Company recognized net losses on investment securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 of $3.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively, compared to net losses of $2.4 million and net gains of $8,000, respectively, for the 

same periods in 2021. Net losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily the result of unrealized losses on equity investments. 

The Company has typically written call options with terms of less than three months against certain U.S. Treasury and agency securities held in its portfolio for liquidity and other purposes. Management has entered into these transactions with the goal of economically hedging security positions and enhancing its overall return on its investment portfolio by using fees generated from these options to compensate for net interest margin compression. These option transactions are designed to mitigate overall interest rate risk and do not qualify as hedges pursuant to accounting guidance. There were no outstanding call option contracts at September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized net trading gains of $4.1 million and $39,000, respectively. Trading gains and losses recorded by the Company primarily result from fair value adjustments related to interest rate derivatives not designated as hedges. 

Interest rate swap fee revenue decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same periods in 2021. Swap fee revenues result from interest rate swap transactions related to both customer-based trades and the related matched trades with inter-bank dealer counterparties. The revenue recognized on this customer-based activity is sensitive to the pace of organic loan growth, the shape of the yield curve and the customers&#8217; expectations of interest rates. 

Miscellaneous income decreased $2.7 million and $7.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same periods in 2021. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to $1.8 million less partnership income compared to the to the same period in 2021. On a year-to-date basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the decrease also included $2.5 million of losses recorded in the second quarter of 2022 relating to the sale of a property no longer considered for future expansion and losses on the anticipated sale of a former data processing facility and the $4.0 million net gain on the sale of three branches recorded in the second quarter of 2021.

Notable contributions to the change in non-interest expense are as follows: 

Total salaries and employee benefits expense increased for the three months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to increased salaries expense, partially offset by decreased commissions and incentive compensation primarily due to lower commission expense due to declining mortgage production. On a year-to-date basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, total salaries and employee benefits expense decreased primarily due to a reduction in commissions and incentive compensation, partially offset by an increase in salaries expense. 

Software and equipment expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same periods in 2021 as a result of higher software license fees as well as higher computer and software depreciation expense as the Company invests in enhancements to the digital customer experience, upgrades to infrastructure and enhancements to information security capabilities. 

Advertising and marketing expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same periods in 2021 as a result of higher digital advertising costs as well as increased sponsorship activity. Marketing costs are incurred to promote the Company&#8217;s brand, commercial banking capabilities and various products, and to attract loans and deposits and announce new branch openings as well as the expansion of the Company&#8217;s non-bank businesses. The level of marketing expenditures depends on the type of marketing programs utilized, which are determined based on the market area, targeted audience, competition and various other factors. 

Miscellaneous expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same periods in 2021 as a result of various other operational costs including a $1.1 million increase in non-income tax expense recorded in the third quarter of 2022 and a $1.3 million increase in postage compared to the nine month period ended September 30, 2021. Miscellaneous expense includes ATM expenses, correspondent bank charges, directors fees, telephone, postage, corporate insurance, dues and subscriptions, problem loan expenses and other miscellaneous operational losses and costs. 

Income Taxes 

The Company recorded income tax expense of $57.1 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $40.6 million in the third quarter of 2021. The effective tax rates were 28.53% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 27.12% in the third quarter of 2021. During the first nine months of 2022, the Company recorded income tax expense of $140.5 million compared to $133.4 million for the first nine months of 2021. The effective tax rates were 27.80% for the first nine months of 2022 and 26.63% for the first nine months of 2021. 

The effective tax rate increased in the third quarter of 2022 as the Company recorded approximately $2.0 million of additional income tax expense related to earnings at its Canadian subsidiary. The tax, known as GILTI (&#8220;Global Intangible Low-taxed Income&#8221;), is a U.S. minimum tax on global profits. During the quarter, the impact of the rapid and significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar caused the GILTI tax to be applicable. 

Operating Segment Results 

As described in Note 14 - Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report, the Company&#8217;s operations consist of three primary segments: community banking, specialty finance and wealth management. The Company&#8217;s profitability is primarily dependent on the net interest income, provision for credit losses, non-interest income and operating expenses of its community banking segment. For purposes of internal segment profitability, management allocates certain intersegment and parent company balances. Management allocates a portion of revenues to the specialty finance segment related to loans and leases originated by the specialty finance segment and sold or assigned to the community banking segment. Similarly, for purposes of analyzing the contribution from the wealth management segment, management allocates a portion of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on deposit balances of customers of the wealth management segment to the wealth management segment. Finally, expenses incurred at the Wintrust parent company are allocated to each segment based on each segment&#8217;s risk-weighted assets. 

The community banking segment&#8217;s net interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 totaled $319.9 million as compared to $220.0 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of $99.9 million, or 45%. On a year-to-date basis, net interest income for the segment increased by $167.1 million from $643.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to $810.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in the three and nine month periods was primarily attributable to increased interest and fees on loans due to of loan growth and increased interest rates, partially offset by increased interest expense on deposit s. The community banking segment&#8217;s non-interest income totaled $60.6 million in the third quarter of 2022, a decrease of $33.7 million, or 36%, when compared to the third quarter of 2021 total of $94.3 million. On a year-to-date basis, non-interest income totaled $245.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 , a decrease of $86.8 million , or 26%, compared to $332.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in the three and nine month periods was primarily the result of reduced mortgage banking revenue due to lower originations for sale and lower gain on sale margin, partially offset by the increase in the fair value of MSRs related to changes in fair value model assumptions. The community banking segment recorded provision for credit losses of $3.6 million and $28.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to a release of credit reserves of $7.4 million and $69.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2021. The increase in provision for credit losses for the three and nine month periods was primarily the result of loan growth as well as the Company&#8217;s macroeconomic forecasts of key model inputs (most notably, Baa corporate credit spreads) . The community banking segment&#8217;s net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 totaled $104.7 million, an increase of $35.9 million as compared to net income in the third quarter of 2021 of $68.8 million. On a year-to-date basis, the net income of the community banking segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 totaled $249.4 million as compared to $263.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

The specialty finance segment&#8217;s net interest income totaled $64.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, compared to $52.7 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of $11.5 million, or 22%. On a year-to-date basis, net interest income for the segment increased $35.5 million, or 25% compared to the same period in 2021. The increase for both the three and nine month periods was primarily due to loan growth and increased interest rates on the premium finance receivables portfolios. The specialty finance segment&#8217;s non-interest income was relatively unchanged totaling $23.8 million and $24.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and increased slightly to $72.9 million from $70.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our property and casualty insurance premium finance operations, life insurance finance operations, lease financing operations and accounts receivable finance operations accounted for 42%, 30%, 24% and 4%, respectively, of the total revenues of our specialty finance business for the nine month period ended September 30, 2022. The net income of the specialty finance segment for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 totaled $27.2 million as compared to $30.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. On a year-to-date basis, the net income of the specialty finance segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 totaled $87.3 million as compared to $78.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

The wealth management segment reported net interest income of $9.6 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $8.0 million in the same quarter of 2021, an increase of $1.6 million, or 20%. On a year-to-date basis, net interest income totaled $27.5 million for the first nine months of 2022, as compared to $23.2 million for the first nine months of 2021. Net interest income for this segment is primarily comprised of an allocation of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing wealth management customer account balances on deposit at the banks. Wealth management customer account balances on deposit at the banks averaged $2.8 billion and $2.3 billion in the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. This segment recorded non-interest income of $32.5 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $33.6 million for the third quarter of 2021. On a year-to-date basis, this segment recorded non-interest income of $93.3 million for the first nine months of 2022 as compared to $95.7 million for the first nine months of 2021. Distribution of wealth management services through each bank continues to be a focus of the Company. The Company is committed to growing the wealth management segment in order to better service its customers and create a more diversified revenue stream. The wealth management segment&#8217;s net income totaled $11.1 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $10.1 million for the third quarter of 2021. On a year-to-date basis, the wealth management segment&#8217;s net income totaled $28.1 million and $26.1 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Financial Condition 

Total assets were $52.4 billion at September 30, 2022, representing an increase of $4.6 billion, or 10%, when compared to September 30, 2021 and an increase of approximately $1.4 billion, or 11% on an annualized basis, when compared to June 30, 2022. Total funding, which includes deposits, all notes and advances, including secured borrowings and the junior subordinated debentures, was $46.3 billion at September 30, 2022, $44.9 billion at June 30, 2022, and $42.4 billion at September 30, 2021. See Notes 5, 6, 10, 11 and 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for additional period-end detail on the Company&#8217;s interest-earning assets and funding liabilities.

(2) Liquidity management assets include investment securities, other securities, interest earning deposits with banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements. 

(3) Other earning assets include brokerage customer receivables and trading account securities. 

Mortgage loans held-for-sale. Average mortgage loans held-for-sale totaled $455.3 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $560.7 million in the second quarter of 2022 and $871.8 million in the third quarter of 2021. These balances represent mortgage loans awaiting subsequent sale in the secondary market with such sales eliminating the interest-rate risk associated with these loans, as they are predominantly long-term fixed rate loans, and provide a source of non-interest revenue. The decrease in average balance from 2021 to 2022 was primarily due to lower mortgage origination production as well as the transfer to held-for-investment classification of certain loans previously repurchased by the Company under the early buyout option available for loans sold to GNMA with servicing retained. See &#8220;Loan Portfolio and Asset Quality&#8221; section below in this Item 2 for additional discussion of these early buyout options. 

Loans, net of unearned income. Average total loans, net of unearned income, totaled $37.4 billion in the third quarter of 2022, increasing $4.4 billion, or 13%, from the third quarter of 2021 and increasing $1.6 billion, or 17% on an annualized basis, from the second quarter of 2022. Average commercial loans, excluding PPP loans, totaled $12.0 billion in the third quarter of 2022, and increased $2.2 billion, or 23%, over the average balance in the third quarter of 2021 and $438.8 million, or 15% on an annualized basis, over the average balance in the second quarter of 2022. Average commercial PPP loans totaled $54.3 million in the third quarter of 2022, and decreased $1.4 billion, or 96%, from the average balance in the third quarter of 2021 and decreased $111.9 million from the average balance in the second quarter of 2022. The decrease in average commercial PPP loans in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2022 and second quarter of 2021 was primarily the result of significant payoffs in the portfolio through the forgiveness process administered by the SBA. Average commercial real estate loans totaled $9.5 billion in the third quarter of 2022, increasing $687.8 million, or 8%, over the third quarter of 2021. Combined, the commercial and commercial real estate loan categories comprised 57% of the average loan portfolio in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to 59% in the second quarter of 2022 and 61% in the third quarter of 2021. Excluding the impact of PPP loans, growth realized in these aggregated categories for the third quarter of 2022 as compared to the sequential and prior year periods is primarily attributable to increased business development efforts. 

Home equity loan portfolio averaged $326.7 million in the third quarter of 2022, and decreased $28.8 million, or 8% from the average balance of $355.5 million in same period of 2021. The decrease in the home equity loan portfolio is primarily the result of borrowers preferring to finance through longer term, low rate mortgage loans prior to rising interest rates in 2022. The Company has been actively managing its home equity portfolio to ensure that diligent pricing, appraisal and other underwriting activities continue to exist. 

Residential real estate loans averaged $2.1 billion in the third quarter of 2022, and increased $599.1 million, or 40% from the average balance of $1.5 billion in same period of 2021. Additionally, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the average balance increased $219.8 million, or 46% on an annualized basis. The increase in average balance compared to both periods was partially due to the Company deciding to allocate more balances from its mortgage production for investment instead of for subsequent sale and servicing in the secondary market. 

Average premium finance receivables totaled $13.5 billion in the third quarter of 2022, and accounted for 36% of the Company&#8217;s average total loans. In the third quarter of 2022, average premium finance receivables increased $2.3 billion, or 21%, from the same period of 2021. The increase during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021 was the result of continued originations within the portfolio due to hardening insurance market conditions driving a higher average size of new property and casualty insurance premium finance receivables as well as effective marketing and customer servicing. Approximately $4.1 billion of premium finance receivables were originated in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $3.1 billion during the same period of 2021. Premium finance receivables consist of a property and casualty portfolio and a life portfolio comprising approximately 42% and 58%, respectively, of the average total balance of premium finance receivables for the third quarter of 2022, and 42% and 58%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2021. 

Other loans represent a wide variety of personal and consumer loans to individuals. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk due to the type and nature of the collateral. 

Liquidity management assets. Funds that are not utilized for loan originations are used to purchase investment securities and short term money market investments, to sell as federal funds and to maintain in interest bearing deposits with banks. Average liquidity management assets accounted for 21% and 23% of total average earning assets in the third quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. Average liquidity management assets decreased $476.9 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period of 2021. The balances of these assets can fluctuate based on management&#8217;s ongoing effort to manage liquidity and for asset liability management purposes. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate and utilize liquidity sources as needed, including the management of availability with the FHLB and FRB and utilization of the revolving credit facility with unaffiliated banks. 

Other earning assets. Other earning assets include brokerage customer receivables and trading account securities. In the normal course of business, Wintrust Investments' activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing of various securities transactions. Wintrust Investments customer securities activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis. In margin transactions, Wintrust Investments, under an agreement with an out-sourced securities firm, extends credit to its customers, subject to various regulatory and internal margin requirements, collateralized by cash and securities in customers&#8217; accounts. In connection with these activities, Wintrust Investments executes and the out-sourced firm clears customer transactions relating to the sale of securities not yet purchased, substantially all of which are transacted on a margin basis subject to individual exchange regulations. Such transactions may expose Wintrust Investments to off-balance-sheet risk, particularly in volatile trading markets, in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur. In the event a customer fails to satisfy its obligations, Wintrust Investments under the agreement with the outsourced securities firm, may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market prices to fulfill the customers&#8217; obligations. Wintrust Investments seeks to control the risks associated with its customers&#8217; activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulatory and internal guidelines. Wintrust Investments monitors required margin levels daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral or to reduce positions when necessary.

Commercial and commercial real estate loans. Our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are comprised primarily of lines of credit for working capital purposes and commercial real estate loans. The table below sets forth information regarding the types and amounts of our loans within these portfolios as of September 30, 2022 and 2021:

We make commercial loans for many purposes, including working capital lines, which are generally renewable annually and supported by business assets, personal guarantees and additional collateral. Such loans may vary in size based on customer need. In addition, the Company has participated in the PPP starting in 2020. As of September 30, 2022 the carrying balance of such loans was reduced to approximately $43.7 million primarily resulting from forgiveness by the SBA. Commercial business lending is generally considered to involve a slightly higher degree of risk than traditional consumer bank lending. Primarily as a result of growth in the Company&#8217;s commercial loan portfolio, excluding PPP, our allowance for credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio increased to $135.3 million as of September 30, 2022 compared to $109.8 million as of September 30, 2021. 

Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by a first mortgage lien and assignment of rents on the property. Since most of our bank branches are located in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin, 76.9% of our commercial real estate loan portfolio is located in this region as of September 30, 2022. We have been able to effectively manage our total non-performing commercial real estate loans, aided by our credit management process. As of September 30, 2022, our allowance for credit losses related to this portfolio was $150.7 million compared to $140.0 million as of September 30, 2021 . The increase in the allowance for credit losses is primarily a result of growth in our commercial real estate portfolio. 

The Company also participates in mortgage warehouse lending, which is included above within commercial, industrial and other, by providing interim funding to unaffiliated mortgage bankers to finance residential mortgages originated by such bankers for sale into the secondary market. The Company&#8217;s loans to the mortgage bankers are secured by the business assets of the mortgage companies as well as the specific mortgage loans funded by the Company, after they have been pre-approved for purchase by third party end lenders. The Company may also provide interim financing for packages of mortgage loans on a bulk basis in circumstances where the mortgage bankers desire to competitively bid on a number of mortgages for sale as a package in the secondary market. Amounts advanced with respect to any particular mortgage loan are usually required to be repaid within 21 days. 

Home equity loans. Our home equity loans and lines of credit are originated by each of our banks in their local markets where we have a strong understanding of the underlying real estate value. Our banks monitor and manage these loans, and we conduct an automated review of all home equity loans and lines of credit at least twice per year. This review collects current credit performance for each home equity borrower and identifies situations where the credit strength of the borrower is declining, or where there are events that may influence repayment, such as tax liens or judgments. Our banks use this information to manage loans that may be higher risk and to determine whether to obtain additional credit information or updated property valuations. 

The rates we offer on new home equity lending are based on several factors, including appraisals and valuation due diligence, in order to reflect inherent risk, and we place additional scrutiny on larger home equity requests. In a limited number of cases, we issue home equity credit together with first mortgage financing, and requests for such financing are evaluated on a combined basis. It is not our practice to advance more than 85% of the appraised value of the underlying asset, which ratio we refer to as the loan-to-value ratio, or LTV ratio, and a majority of the credit we previously extended, when issued, had an LTV ratio of less than 80%. Our home equity loan portfolio has performed well in light of the ongoing volatility in the overall residential real estate market. 

Residential real estate. Our residential real estate portfolio includes one- to four-family adjustable rate mortgages, construction loans to individuals and bridge financing loans for qualifying customers as well as certain long-term fixed rate loans. As of September 30, 2022, our residential loan portfolio totaled $2.2 billion, or 6% of our total outstanding loans. 

Our adjustable rate mortgages are often non-agency conforming. Adjustable rate mortgage loans decrease the interest rate risk we face on our mortgage portfolio. However, this risk is not eliminated due to the fact that such loans generally provide for periodic and lifetime limits on the interest rate adjustments among other features. Additionally, adjustable rate mortgages may pose a higher risk of delinquency and default because they require borrowers to make larger payments when interest rates rise. As of September 30, 2022, $33.8 million of our residential real estate portfolio, including early buyout loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, or 1.5%, were classified as nonaccrual, $68.1 million in loans were 90 or more days past due and still accruing, $2.8 million were 30 to 89 days past due and $2.1 billion were current, or 95.3%. We believe that since our loan portfolio consists primarily of locally originated loans, and since the majority of our borrowers are longer-term customers with lower LTV ratios, we face a relatively low risk of borrower default and delinquency. 

Due to interest rate risk considerations, we generally sell in the secondary market loans originated with long-term fixed rates, for which we receive fee income. We may also selectively retain certain of these loans within our banks&#8217; own portfolios where they are non-agency conforming, or where the terms of the loans make them favorable to retain. A portion of the loans we sold into the secondary market were sold with the servicing of those loans retained. The amount of loans serviced for others as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $13.9 billion and $12.7 billion, respectively. All other mortgage loans sold into the secondary market were sold without the retention of servicing rights. 

The Government National Mortgage Association (&#8220;GNMA&#8221;) optional repurchase programs allow financial institutions acting as servicers to buyout individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the institution was the original transferor of such loans. At the option of the servicer and without prior authorization from GNMA, the servicer may repurchase such delinquent loans for an amount equal to the remaining principal balance of the loan. Under FASB ASC Topic 860, &#8220;Transfers and Servicing,&#8221; this early buyout option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met, at which time the option becomes unconditional. When the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans under the unconditional repurchase option and the expected benefit of the potential repurchase 

is more than trivial, the loans can no longer be reported as sold and must be brought back onto the balance sheet as loans at fair value, regardless of whether the Company intends to exercise the early buyout option. These rebooked loans are reported as loans held-for-investment, part of the residential real estate portfolio, with the offsetting liability being reported in accrued interest payable and other liabilities. When the early buyout option on these rebooked GNMA loans is exercised, the repurchased loans continue to be carried at fair value. Additionally, such loans typically transfer to mortgage loans held-for-sale at the time of early buyout as the Company&#8217;s intent is to cure and resell such loans subsequent to repurchase from GNMA. If such intent to cure and resell changes subsequent to early buyout, the Company reclassifies such loans as held-for-investment. Early buyout loans classified as held-for-investment totaled $148.7 million at September 30, 2022 compared to $27.0 million at September 30, 2021. Such loans consist of both the rebooked GNMA loans and the early buyout exercised loans classified as held-for-investment discussed above. Rebooked GNMA loans held-for-investment amounted to $57.2 million at September 30, 2022, compared to $18.8 million balance at September 30, 2021. The increase in balance from September 30, 2021 to September 30, 2022 was the result of higher delinquencies between periods and less frequent exercising of the early buyout option by the Company. As of September 30, 2022, early buyout exercised loans held-for-investment totaled $91.5 million compared to $8.1 million as of September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2022, early buyout exercised mortgage loans held-for-sale totaled $160.1 million compared to $354.6 million as of September 30, 2021. The decline in early buyout exercised mortgage loans held-for-sale relative to the prior year is primarily due to the resale of mortgage loans to GNMA as well as the reclassification of certain loans to held-for-investment classification due to an inability to resell due to continued delinquency. 

It is not our current practice to underwrite, and we have no plans to underwrite, subprime, Alt A, no or little documentation loans, or option ARM loans. 

Premium finance receivables &#8211; property and casualty. FIRST Insurance Funding and FIFC Canada originated approximately $3.5 billion in property and casualty insurance premium finance receivables in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to $2.8 billion of originations in the third quarter of 2021. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, FIRST Insurance Funding and FIFC Canada originated approximately $10.1 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively, in property and casualty insurance premium finance receivables. FIRST Insurance Funding and FIFC Canada make loans to businesses to finance the insurance premiums they pay on their property and casualty insurance policies. The loans are originated by working through independent medium and large insurance agents and brokers located throughout the United States and Canada. The insurance premiums financed are primarily for commercial customers&#8217; purchases of liability, property and casualty and other commercial insurance. 

This lending involves relatively rapid turnover of the loan portfolio and high volume of loan originations. Because of the indirect nature of this lending through third party agents and brokers and because the borrowers are located nationwide and in Canada, this segment is more susceptible to third party fraud than relationship lending. The Company performs ongoing credit and other reviews of the agents and brokers, and performs various internal audit steps to mitigate against the risk of any fraud. The majority of these loans are purchased by the banks in order to more fully utilize their lending capacity as these loans generally provide the banks with higher yields than alternative investments. 

Premium finance receivables&#8212;life insurance. Wintrust Life Finance originated approximately $550.1 million in life insurance premium finance receivables in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to $371.9 million of originations in the third quarter of 2021. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, Wintrust Life Finance originated approximately $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, in life insurance premium finance receivables. The Company continues to experience a high level of competition and pricing pressure within the current market. These loans are originated directly with the borrowers with assistance from life insurance carriers, independent insurance agents, financial advisors and legal counsel. The life insurance policy is the primary form of collateral. In addition, these loans often are secured with a letter of credit, marketable securities or certificates of deposit. In some cases, Wintrust Life Finance may make a loan that has a partially unsecured position. 

Consumer and other. Included in the consumer and other loan category is a wide variety of personal and consumer loans to individuals. The banks originate consumer loans in order to provide a wider range of financial services to their customers. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk than mortgage loans due to the type and nature of the collateral.

BSBY - Bloomberg Short Term Bank Yield Index. 

With its ongoing transition from LIBOR, the Company increased the portion of its loan portfolio with interest rate indices that are an alternative to LIBOR during the period, including emerging indices such as SOFR, Ameribor and BSBY. As shown above, at September 30, 2022, variable rate loans with loans priced at SOFR, Ameribor and BSBY totaled $5.4 billion, $334.5 million and $38.1 million, respectively. Additionally, the percentage of the Company&#8217;s variable rate loans indexed to LIBOR decreased to 48% at September 30, 2022 compared to 82% at September 30, 2021. The Company continues its transition of its loan portfolio from LIBOR for both loans existing at September 30, 2022 and future new originations. 

Past Due Loans and Non-Performing Assets 

Our ability to manage credit risk depends in large part on our ability to properly identify and manage problem loans. To do so, the Company operates a credit risk rating system under which our credit management personnel assigns a credit risk rating to each loan at the time of origination and review loans on a regular basis to determine each loan&#8217;s credit risk rating on a scale of 1 through 10 with higher scores indicating higher risk. The credit risk rating structure used is shown below: 

&#160; 

1 Rating &#8212; Minimal Risk (Loss Potential &#8211; none or extremely low) (Superior asset quality, excellent liquidity, minimal leverage) 2 Rating &#8212; Modest Risk (Loss Potential demonstrably low) (Very good asset quality and liquidity, strong leverage capacity) 3 Rating &#8212; Average Risk (Loss Potential low but no longer refutable) (Mostly satisfactory asset quality and liquidity, good leverage capacity) 4 Rating &#8212; Above Average Risk (Loss Potential variable, but some potential for deterioration) (Acceptable asset quality, little excess liquidity, modest leverage capacity) 5 Rating &#8212; Management Attention Risk (Loss Potential moderate if corrective action not taken) (Generally acceptable asset quality, somewhat strained liquidity, minimal leverage capacity) 6 Rating &#8212; Special Mention (Loss Potential moderate if corrective action not taken) (Assets in this category are currently protected, potentially weak, but not to the point of substandard classification) 7 Rating &#8212; Substandard Accrual (Loss Potential distinct possibility that the bank may sustain some loss, but no discernible impairment) (Must have well defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt) 8 Rating &#8212; Substandard Nonaccrual (Loss Potential well documented probability of loss, including potential impairment) (Must have well defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt) 9 Rating &#8212; Doubtful (Loss Potential extremely high) (These assets have all the weaknesses in those classified &#8220;substandard&#8221; with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current existing facts, conditions, and values, highly improbable) 10 Rating &#8212; Loss (fully charged-off) (Loans in this category are considered fully uncollectible.) 

Generally, each loan officer is responsible for monitoring his or her loan portfolio, recommending a credit risk rating for each loan in their portfolio and ensuring the credit risk ratings are appropriate. These credit risk ratings are then ratified by the bank&#8217;s chief credit officer and/or concurrence credit officer. Credit risk ratings are determined by evaluating a number of factors including a borrower&#8217;s financial strength, cash flow coverage, collateral protection and guarantees. The Company maintains an internal loan review function to independently review a portion of the loan portfolio to evaluate the appropriateness of management-assigned credit risk ratings. These ratings are subject to further review at each of our bank subsidiaries by the applicable regulatory authority, including the FRB of Chicago and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), and are also reviewed by our internal audit staff. 

The Company&#8217;s Problem Loan Reporting system includes all such loans described above with credit risk ratings of 6 through 9. This system is designed to provide an ongoing detailed tracking mechanism for each problem loan. Once management determines that a loan has deteriorated to a point where it has a credit risk rating of 6 or worse, the Company&#8217;s Managed Asset Division performs an overall credit and collateral review. As part of this review, all underlying collateral is identified and the valuation methodology is analyzed and tracked. As a result of this initial review by the Company&#8217;s Managed Asset Division, the credit risk rating is reviewed and a portion of the outstanding loan balance may be deemed uncollectible and, as a result, no longer share similar risk characteristics as its related pool. If that is the case, the individual loan is considered collateral dependent and individually assessed for an allowance for credit loss. The Company&#8217;s individual assessment utilizes an independent re-appraisal of the collateral (unless such a third-party evaluation is not possible due to the unique nature of the 

collateral, such as a closely-held business or thinly traded securities). In the case of commercial real estate collateral, an independent third party appraisal is ordered by the Company&#8217;s Real Estate Services Group to determine if there has been any change in the underlying collateral value. These independent appraisals are reviewed by the Real Estate Services Group and sometimes by independent third party valuation experts and may be adjusted depending upon market conditions. 

Through the credit risk rating process, such loans are reviewed to determine if they are performing in accordance with the original contractual terms. If the borrower has failed to comply with the original contractual terms, further action may be required by the Company, including a downgrade in the credit risk rating, movement to nonaccrual status or a charge-off. If the Company determines that a loan amount or portion thereof is uncollectible, the loan&#8217;s credit risk rating is immediately downgraded to an 8 or 9 and the uncollectible amount is charged-off. Any loan that has a partial charge-off continues to be assigned a credit risk rating of an 8 or 9 for the duration of time that a balance remains outstanding. The Company undertakes a thorough and ongoing analysis to determine if additional impairment and/or charge-offs are appropriate and to begin a workout plan for the credit to minimize actual losses. In determining the appropriate charge-off for collateral-dependent loans, the Company considers the results of appraisals for the associated collateral. 

The Company&#8217;s approach to workout plans and restructuring loans is built on the credit-risk rating process. A modification of a loan with an existing credit risk rating of 6 or worse or a modification of any other credit, which will result in a restructured credit risk rating of 6 or worse must be reviewed for TDR classification. In that event, our Managed Assets Division conducts an overall credit and collateral review. A modification of a loan is considered to be a TDR if both (1) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and (2) for economic or legal reasons, the bank grants a concession to a borrower that it would not otherwise consider. The modification of a loan where the credit risk rating is 5 or better both before and after such modification is not considered to be a TDR. Based on the Company&#8217;s credit risk rating system, it considers that borrowers whose credit risk rating is 5 or better are not experiencing financial difficulties and therefore, are not considered TDRs. 

TDRs are individually assessed at the time of the modification and on a quarterly basis to measure an allowance for credit loss. The carrying amount of the loan is compared to the expected payments to be received, discounted at the loan's original rate, or for collateral dependent loans, to the fair value of the collateral. Any shortfall is recorded as a reserve. 

For non-TDR loans, if based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due to it according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, a loan is individually assessed for measuring the allowance for credit losses and if necessary, a reserve is established. In determining the appropriate reserve for collateral-dependent loans, the Company considers the results of appraisals for the associated collateral.

At this time, management believes reserves are appropriate to absorb losses that are expected upon the ultimate resolution of these credits. While the ultimate effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on non-performing assets still remains unknown, significant increases may occur in subsequent periods due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and related impacts on borrowers. Management will continue to actively review and monitor its loan portfolios, in an effort to identify problem credits in a timely 

manner. Please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Overview section of this report for additional discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses, specifically the allowance for loans losses and the allowance for unfunded commitment losses, represents management&#8217;s estimate of lifetime expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is determined quarterly using a methodology that incorporates important risk characteristics of each loan, as described below under &#8220;How We Determine the Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; in this Item 2. 

Management determined that the allowance for credit losses was appropriate at September 30, 2022, and that the loan portfolio is well diversified and well secured, without undue concentration in any specific risk area. While this process involves a high degree of management judgment, the allowance for credit losses is based on a comprehensive, well documented, and consistently applied analysis of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. This analysis takes into consideration all available information existing as of the financial statement date, including environmental factors such as economic, industry, geographical and political factors, when considered applicable. The relative level of allowance for credit losses is reviewed and compared to industry peers. This review encompasses levels of total non-performing loans, portfolio mix, portfolio concentrations and overall levels of net charge-off. Historical trending of both the Company&#8217;s results and the industry peers is also reviewed to analyze comparative significance.

The allowance for credit losses, as related to loans and lending-related commitments, is comprised of an allowance for loan losses, which is determined with respect to loans that we have originated, and an allowance for unfunded commitment losses. A separate allowance for held-to-maturity securities losses is measured related to such debt securities portfolio. Our allowance for unfunded commitment losses is determined with respect to funds that we have committed to lend but for which funds have not yet been disbursed and is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for unfunded lending-related commitments totaled $68.9 million and $47.4 million as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. 

Additions to the allowance for credit losses are charged to earnings through the provision for credit losses. Charge-offs represent the amount of loans that have been determined to be uncollectible during a given period, and are deducted from the allowance for credit losses, and recoveries represent the amount of collections received from loans that had previously been charged off, and are credited to the allowance for credit losses. See Note 7 - Allowance for Credit Losses of the Consolidated 

Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for further discussion of activity within the allowance for credit losses during the period and the relationship with respective loan balances for each loan category and the total loan portfolio. 

How We Determine the Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective or pooled basis by loans that share similar risk characteristics. If the loan no longer exhibits risk characteristics similar to that of a pool, typically due to credit deterioration of the related borrower, the Company analyzes the loan for purposes of individually assessing a specific allowance for credit loss as part of the Problem Loan Reporting system review. A separate reserve is collectively measured for loans continuing to share risk characteristics and, as a result, remaining in the pools. See Note 7 - Allowance for Credit Losses of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for further discussion of the allowance for credit losses measurement process. 

Collective Measurement 

The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective or pooled basis when similar risk characteristics exist, based upon the segmentation discussed above. The Company utilizes modeling methodologies that estimate lifetime credit loss rates on each pool, including methodologies estimating the probability of default and loss given default on specific segments. Historical credit loss history is adjusted for reasonable and supportable forecasts developed by the Company on a quantitative or qualitative basis and incorporates third party economic forecasts. Reasonable and supportable forecasts consider the macroeconomic factors that are most relevant to evaluating and predicting expected credit losses in the Company's financial assets. Currently, the Company utilizes an eight quarter forecast period using a single macroeconomic scenario provided by a third party and reviewed within the Company's governance structure. For periods beyond the ability to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts to historical loss rates at an input level, straight-line over a four quarter reversion period. Expected credit losses are measured over the contractual term of the financial asset with consideration of expected prepayments. Expected extensions, renewals or modifications of the financial asset are only considered when either 1) the expected extension, renewal or modification is contained within the existing agreement and is not unconditionally cancelable, or 2) the expected extension, renewal or modification is reasonably expected to result in a TDR. The methodologies discussed above are applied to both current asset balances on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Condition and off-balance sheet commitments (i.e. unfunded lending-related commitments). 

Individual Assessment 

Loans with a credit risk rating of a 6 through 9 are reviewed on a monthly basis to determine if (a) an amount is deemed uncollectible (a charge-off) or (b) it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. In cases in which collectability is not probable, the loan is considered to no longer exhibit shared risk characteristics of a pool and as a result, is individually assessed for allowance for credit losses measurement purposes. If a loan is individually assessed, the carrying amount of the loan is compared to the expected payments to be received, discounted at the loan&#8217;s original rate, or for foreclosure-probable and collateral dependent loans, to the fair value of the collateral less the estimated cost to sell, when appropriate under accounting rules. Any shortfall is recorded as a specific reserve within the allowance for credit losses. 

Home Equity, Residential Real Estate and Consumer Loans 

The determination of the appropriate allowance for credit losses for home equity, residential real estate and consumer loans differs from the process used for commercial and commercial real estate loans. These portfolios utilize the weighted-average remaining maturity ("WARM") methodology. The WARM methodology is an assumption-based approach that utilizes historical loss and prepayment information as the basis to estimate prepayment and credit adjusted contractual cash flows. The Company considers a qualitative factor to adjust historical information for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The same credit risk rating system and Problem Loan Reporting systems are used. The only significant difference is in how the credit risk ratings are assigned to these loans. 

The home equity loan portfolio is reviewed on a loan by loan basis by analyzing current FICO scores of the borrowers, line availability, recent line usage, an approaching maturity and the aging status of the loan. Certain of these factors, or combination of these factors, may cause a portion of the credit risk ratings of home equity loans across all banks to be downgraded. Similar to commercial and commercial real estate loans, once a home equity loan&#8217;s credit risk rating is downgraded to a 6 through 9, the Company&#8217;s Managed Asset Division reviews and advises the subsidiary banks as to collateral valuations and as to the ultimate resolution of the credits that deteriorate to a nonaccrual status to minimize losses. 

Residential real estate loans that are downgraded to a credit risk rating of 6 through 9 also enter the problem loan reporting system and have the underlying collateral evaluated by the Managed Assets Division. 

Premium Finance Receivables 

The determination of the appropriate allowance for credit losses for premium finance receivables is an assumption-based approach focusing on historical loss rates in the portfolio, adjusted qualitatively for current macroeconomic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 

Methodology in Assessing Impairment and Charge-off Amounts 

In determining the amount of reserves or charge-offs associated with collateral dependent loans, the Company values the loan generally by starting with a valuation obtained from an appraisal of the underlying collateral and then deducting estimated selling costs, if appropriate, to arrive at a net appraised value. We obtain the appraisals of the underlying collateral typically on an annual basis from one of a pre-approved list of independent, third party appraisal firms. Types of appraisal valuations include &#8220;as-is,&#8221; &#8220;as-complete,&#8221; &#8220;as-stabilized,&#8221; bulk, fair market, liquidation and &#8220;retail sellout&#8221; values. 

In many cases, the Company simultaneously values the underlying collateral by marketing the property to market participants interested in purchasing properties of the same type. If the Company receives offers or indications of interest, we will analyze the price and review market conditions to assess whether in light of such information the appraised value overstates the likely price and that a lower price would be a better assessment of the market value of the property and would enable us to liquidate the collateral. Additionally, the Company takes into account the strength of any guarantees or other credit enhancements, and the ability of the borrower to provide value related to those guarantees in determining the ultimate charge-off or reserve associated with any individually assessed loans. Accordingly, the Company may charge-off a loan to a value below the net appraised value if it believes that an expeditious liquidation is desirable in the circumstance and it has legitimate offers or other indications of interest to support a value that is less than the net appraised value. Alternatively, the Company may carry a loan at a value that is in excess of the appraised value if the Company has a guarantee from a borrower or other credit enhancements that the Company believes has realizable value. In evaluating the strength of any guarantee, the Company evaluates the financial wherewithal of the guarantor, the guarantor&#8217;s reputation, and the guarantor&#8217;s willingness and desire to work with the Company. The Company then conducts a review of the strength of a guarantee on a frequency established as the circumstances and conditions of the borrower warrant. 

In circumstances where the Company has received an appraisal but has no third party offers or indications of interest, the Company may enlist the input of realtors in the local market as to the highest valuation that the realtor believes would result in a liquidation of the property given a reasonable marketing period of approximately 90 days. To the extent that the realtors&#8217; indication of market clearing price under such scenario is less than the net appraised valuation, the Company may take a charge-off on the loan to a valuation that is less than the net appraised valuation. 

The Company may also charge-off a loan below the net appraised valuation if the Company holds a junior mortgage position in a piece of collateral whereby the risk to acquiring control of the property through the purchase of the senior mortgage position is deemed to potentially increase the risk of loss upon liquidation due to the amount of time to ultimately market the property and the volatile market conditions. In such cases, the Company may abandon its junior mortgage and charge-off the loan balance in full. 

In other cases, the Company may allow the borrower to conduct a &#8220;short sale,&#8221; which is a sale where the Company allows the borrower to sell the property at a value less than the amount of the loan. Many times, it is possible for the current owner to receive a better price than if the property is marketed by a financial institution which the market place perceives to have a greater desire to liquidate the property at a lower price. To the extent that we allow a short sale at a price below the value indicated by an appraisal, we may take a charge-off beyond the value that an appraisal would have indicated. 

Other market conditions may require a reserve to bring the carrying value of the loan below the net appraised valuation such as litigation surrounding the borrower and/or property securing our loan or other market conditions impacting the value of the collateral. 

Having determined the net value based on the factors such as those noted above and compared that value to the book value of the loan, the Company arrives at a charge-off amount or a specific reserve included in the allowance for credit losses. In summary, for collateral dependent loans, appraisals are used as the fair value starting point in the estimate of net value. Estimated costs to sell are deducted from the appraised value, when appropriate under current accounting rules, to arrive at the net appraised value. Although an external appraisal is the primary source of valuation utilized for charge-offs on collateral 

dependent loans, alternative sources of valuation may become available between appraisal dates. As a result, we may utilize values obtained through these alternative sources, which include purchase and sale agreements, legitimate indications of interest, negotiated short sales, realtor price opinions, sale of the note or support from guarantors, as the basis for charge-offs. These alternative sources of value are used only if deemed to be more representative of value based on updated information regarding collateral resolution. In addition, if an appraisal is not deemed current, a discount to appraised value may be utilized. Any adjustments from appraised value to net value are detailed and justified in an impairment analysis, which is reviewed and approved by the Company&#8217;s Managed Assets Division. 

TDRs 

At September 30, 2022, the Company had $43.2 million in loans modified in TDRs. The $43.2 million in TDRs represents 219 credits in which economic concessions were granted to certain borrowers to better align the terms of their loans with their current ability to pay. The balance decreased from $45.4 million representing 227 credits at June 30, 2022 and decreased from $48.5 million representing 254 credits at September 30, 2021. 

Concessions were granted on a case-by-case basis working with these borrowers to find modified terms that would assist them in retaining their businesses or their homes and attempt to keep these loans in an accruing status for the Company. Typical concessions include reduction of the interest rate on the loan to a rate considered lower than market and other modification of terms including forgiveness of a portion of the loan balance, extension of the maturity date, and/or modifications from principal and interest payments to interest-only payments for a certain period. See Note 7 - Allowance for Credit Losses of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report for further discussion regarding the effectiveness of these modifications in keeping the modified loans current based upon contractual terms. 

Subsequent to its restructuring, any TDR that becomes nonaccrual or more than 90 days past-due and still accruing interest will be included in the Company&#8217;s non-performing loans. Each TDR was individually assessed when measuring the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2022 and approximately $2.1 million was appropriately reserved for through the Company&#8217;s normal reserving methodology in the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses. Additionally, at September 30, 2022, the Company was committed to lend an additional $257,000 of funds to borrowers under the contractual terms of TDRs. 

The table below presents a summary of TDRs for the respective periods, presented by loan category and accrual status:

(1) Loan was previously classified as a TDR and subsequently performed in compliance with the loan's modified terms for a period of six months (including over a calendar year-end) at a modified interest rate which represented a market rate at the time of restructuring. Per our TDR policy, the TDR classification is removed. 

Other Real Estate Owned 

In certain circumstances, the Company is required to take action against the real estate collateral of specific loans. The Company uses foreclosure only as a last resort for dealing with borrowers experiencing financial hardships. The Company employs extensive contact and restructuring procedures to attempt to find other solutions for our borrowers. The tables below present a summary of other real estate owned and shows the activity for the respective periods and the balance for each property type:

Total average deposits for the third quarter of 2022 were $42.2 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion, or 7%, from the third quarter of 2021. The increase in average deposits is primarily attributable to organic growth of retail deposits. 

Wealth management deposits are funds from the brokerage customers of Wintrust Investments, CDEC and trust and asset management customers of the Company which have been placed into deposit accounts of the banks (&#8220;wealth management deposits&#8221; in the table above). Wealth Management deposits consist primarily of money market accounts. Consistent with reasonable interest rate risk parameters, these funds have generally been invested in loan production of the banks as well as other investments suitable for banks. 

Brokered Deposits 

While the Company obtains a portion of its total deposits through brokered deposits, the Company does so primarily as an asset-liability management tool to assist in the management of interest rate risk, and the Company does not consider brokered deposits to be a vital component of its current liquidity resources. Historically, brokered deposits have represented a small component of the Company&#8217;s total deposits outstanding, as set forth in the table below: 

September 30, December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 2021 2020 2019 Total deposits $ 42,797,191 &#160; $ 39,952,558 $ 42,095,585 $ 37,092,651 $ 30,107,138 Brokered deposits 2,532,769 &#160; 1,877,093 1,591,083 1,843,227 1,011,404 Brokered deposits as a percentage of total deposits 5.9 &#160; % 4.7 % 3.8 % 5.0 % 3.4 % 

Brokered deposits include certificates of deposit obtained through deposit brokers, deposits received through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Program (&#8220;CDARs&#8221;), and certain deposits of brokerage customers from unaffiliated companies which have been placed into deposit accounts of the banks. 

Other Funding Sources 

Although deposits are the Company&#8217;s primary source of funding its interest-earning assets, the Company&#8217;s ability to manage the types and terms of deposits is somewhat limited by customer preferences and market competition. As a result, in addition to deposits and the issuance of equity securities and the retention of earnings, the Company uses several other funding sources to support its growth. These sources include FHLB advances, notes payable, short-term borrowings, secured borrowings, subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures. The Company evaluates the terms and unique characteristics of each source, as well as its asset-liability management position, in determining the use of such funding sources. 

The following table sets forth, by category, the composition of the average balances of other funding sources for the quarterly periods presented: 

Three Months Ended September 30, June 30, September 30, (In thousands) 2022 2022 2021 FHLB advances $ 1,403,573 &#160; $ 1,197,390 $ 1,241,073 Other borrowings: Notes payable 

69,562 &#160; 74,912 90,960 Short-term borrowings 14,497 &#160; 14,791 13,183 Secured borrowings 332,905 &#160; 337,626 344,724 Other 61,945 &#160; 62,450 63,918 Total other borrowings $ 478,909 &#160; $ 489,779 $ 512,785 Subordinated notes 437,191 &#160; 437,084 436,746 Junior subordinated debentures 253,566 &#160; 253,566 253,566 Total other funding sources $ 2,573,239 &#160; $ 2,377,819 $ 2,444,170 

FHLB advances provide the banks with access to fixed-rate funds that are useful in mitigating interest rate risk and achieving an acceptable interest rate spread on fixed-rate loans or securities. Additionally, the banks have the ability to borrow shorter-term, overnight funding from the FHLB for other general purposes. FHLB advances to the banks totaled $2.3 billion at September 30, 2022 and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021. 

Notes payable balances represent the balances on a loan agreement (&#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) with unaffiliated banks consisting of a $100.0 million revolving credit facility (&#8220;Revolving Credit Facility&#8221;) and a $150.0 million term facility (&#8220;Term Facility&#8221;). Both the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Facility are available for corporate purposes such as to provide capital to fund continued growth at existing bank subsidiaries, possible future acquisitions and for other general corporate matters. The Company was contractually required to borrow the entire amount of the Term Facility on September 18, 2018 and all such borrowings must be repaid by September 18, 2023. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had a balance under the Term Facility of $64.3 million and $85.7 million, respectively. At September 30, 2022, the Company had no outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility. 

An additional amendment to the Credit Agreement was executed and effective as of September 13, 2022. The amendment provided for, among other things, increases in the applicable rate with respect to each Term SOFR Loan (in the case of a borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility) from 1.45% to 1.55% and with respect to each Base Rate Loan (in the case of a borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility) from 0.60% to 0.70%. The amendment also extended the maturity date under the Revolving Credit Facility to September 12, 2023. 

Short-term borrowings include securities sold under repurchase agreements of customer sweep accounts in connection with master repurchase agreements at the banks. These borrowings totaled $9.2 million at September 30, 2022 compared to $9.2 million at December 31, 2021 and $14.1 million at September 30, 2021. This funding category typically fluctuates based on customer preferences and daily liquidity needs of the banks, their customers and the banks&#8217; operating subsidiaries. 

The balance of secured borrowings primarily represents a third party Canadian transaction (&#8220;Canadian Secured Borrowing&#8221;). Under the Canadian Secured Borrowing, the Company, through its subsidiary, FIFC Canada, sells an undivided co-ownership interest in all receivables owed to FIFC Canada to an unrelated third party in exchange for cash payments pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement (&#8220;Receivables Purchase Agreement&#8221;). 

Other borrowings at September 30, 2022 represent a fixed-rate promissory note (&#8220;Fixed-Rate Promissory Note&#8221;) issued by the Company in June 2017. Amendments to the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note since issuance increased the principal amount to $66.4 million, reduced the interest rate to 1.70% and extended the maturity date to March 31, 2025. The Fixed-Rate Promissory Note relates to and is secured by three office buildings owned by the Company. At September 30, 2022, the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note had a balance of $61.8 million compared to $63.3 million at December 31, 2021 and $63.8 million at September 30, 2021. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company made monthly principal and interest payments. 

At September 30, 2022, the Company had outstanding subordinated notes totaling $437.3 million compared to $436.9 million and $436.8 million outstanding at December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021, respectively. In 2019, the Company issued $300.0 million of subordinated notes, receiving $296.7 million in net proceeds. The notes have a stated interest rate of 4.85% and mature in June 2029. In 2014, the Company issued $140.0 million of subordinated notes receiving $139.1 million in net proceeds. These notes have a stated interest rate of 5.00% and mature in June 2024. Subordinated notes are stated at par adjusted for unamortized issuance costs paid related to such debt. 

The Company had $253.6 million of junior subordinated debentures outstanding as of September 30, 2022, December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021. The amounts reflected on the balance sheet represent the junior subordinated debentures issued to eleven trusts by the Company and equal the amount of the preferred and common securities issued by the trusts. At September 30, 2022, the Company included $245.5 million of the junior subordinated debentures, net of common securities, in Tier 2 regulatory capital. 

See Note 11 - FHLB Advances, Other Borrowings and Subordinated Notes and Note 12 - Junior Subordinated Debentures of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for details of period end balances and other information for these various funding sources.

(1) Reflects the Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5%. 

(2) Reflects the well-capitalized standard applicable to the Company for purposes of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation Y. The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies (&#8220;BHCs&#8221;) to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the U.S. Basel III Rule or to add Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio requirements to this standard. As a result, the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio are denoted as &#8220;N/A&#8221; in this column. If the Federal Reserve were to apply the same or a very similar well-capitalized standard to BHCs as the standard applicable to our subsidiary banks, we believe the Company&#8217;s capital ratios as of September 30, 2022 would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard. 

In February 2019, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) issued a final rule to address the changes to the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, including banking organizations&#8217; implementation of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard as of its date of adoption, or January 1, 2020. In March 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC published an interim final rule to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The interim final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). The Company adopted the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period. 

The Company&#8217;s principal sources of funds at the holding company level are dividends from its subsidiaries, borrowings under its loan agreement with unaffiliated banks and proceeds from the issuances of subordinated debt and additional equity. Refer to Notes 11, 12 and 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 for further information on these various funding sources. Management is committed to maintaining the Company&#8217;s capital levels above the &#8220;Well Capitalized&#8221; levels established by the FRB for bank holding companies. 

The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approves dividends from time to time, however, the ability to declare a dividend is limited by the Company&#8217;s financial condition, the terms of the Company&#8217;s Series D and Series E Preferred Stock, the terms of the Company&#8217;s Trust Preferred Securities offerings and under certain financial covenants in the Company&#8217;s revolving and term facilities. In January, April, and July of 2022, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.34 per common share. In January, April, July and October of 2021, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 per common share. 

The Company continues to leverage its capital management framework to assess and monitor risk when making capital decisions, including uncertainty from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

See Note 18 - Shareholders&#8217; Equity and Earnings Per Share of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for details on the Company&#8217;s issuance of Series D Preferred Stock in June 2015, Series E Preferred Stock and associated Depositary Shares in May 2020, and additional common stock offering in June 2022. The Company hereby incorporates by reference Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report in its entirety. 

LIQUIDITY 

The Company manages the liquidity position of its banking operations to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet customers&#8217; needs for loans and deposit withdrawals. The management process includes the utilization of stress testing processes and other aspects of the Company's liquidity management framework to assess and monitor risk, and inform decision making. The liquidity to meet the demands of customers is provided by maturing assets, liquid assets that can be converted to cash and the ability to attract funds from external sources. Liquid assets refer to money market assets such as Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks, as well as available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are not pledged to secure public funds. In addition, trade date receivables represent certain sales or calls of available-for-sale securities that await cash settlement, typically in the month following the trade date. 

In addition to the liquidity management noted above, in the second quarter of 2022, the Company sold a total of 3,450,000 shares of its common stock through a public offering. Net proceeds to the Company totaled approximately $285.7 million, net of estimated issuance costs. In the third quarter of 2022, we maintained our liquid assets to ensure that we would have the balance sheet strength to serve our clients. As a result, the Company believes that it has sufficient funds and access to funds to effectively meet its working capital and other needs as well as manage through the continued COVID-19 pandemic. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate liquidity sources, including the management of availability with the FHLB and FRB and utilization of the revolving credit facility with unaffiliated banks. Please refer to Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Interest-Earning Assets, -Deposits, -Other Funding Sources and -Shareholders&#8217; Equity sections of this report for additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s liquidity position. Please refer to Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Overview section of this report for additional discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

INFLATION 

A banking organization&#8217;s assets and liabilities are primarily monetary. Changes in the rate of inflation typically do not have as great an impact on the financial condition of a bank as do changes in interest rates. Moreover, interest rates do not necessarily change at the same percentage as inflation. Accordingly, changes in inflation are not expected to have as material an impact on the Company&#8217;s business as entities operating in other industries. An analysis of the Company&#8217;s asset and liability structure provides the best indication of how the organization is positioned to respond to changing interest rates. See &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; section of this report for additional information.
