Introduction 

Wintrust is a financial holding company that provides traditional community banking services, primarily in the Chicago metropolitan area, southern Wisconsin and northwest Indiana, and operates other financing businesses on a national basis and in Canada through several non-bank business units. Additionally, Wintrust offers a full array of wealth management services primarily to customers in the Chicago metropolitan area, southern Wisconsin and northwest Indiana. 

Overview 

Impact of COVID-19 

In March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, resulting in unprecedented uncertainty and volatility in world-wide financial markets. Governments' actions calling for shelter in place and social distancing have led to rapid changes in business revenues, increased unemployment, and have impacted consumer activity; all of which have impacted and may continue to impact the Company's current and future results. 

The Company activated its pandemic response plan in early March, as well as applicable elements of its business continuity plan. In order to protect the health of our customers and employees, and in accordance with applicable government directives, we modified certain of our business protocols to direct employees to work from home unless their role required them to be on site, in which case we have implemented enhanced safety measures including social distancing, enhanced cleaning and sanitization, and certain personal protective equipment. With the phased reopening of certain state and municipal areas, the Company has developed a comprehensive plan that permits certain remote employees to return to their respective workplaces, where enhanced safety measures also have been implemented. At present, however, the majority of the Company&#8217;s workforce continues to work remotely on a nearly daily basis. 

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES") Act was enacted. The CARES Act includes appropriations and other measures designed to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP"), which is designed to aid eligible small and medium-sized businesses through federally-guaranteed loans distributed through certain banks, under the administration of the Small Business Administration ("SBA"). As of June 30, 2020, the Company secured authorization from the SBA and funded over 11,000 PPP loans with a carrying balance of approximately $3.3 billion. PPP loans are forgivable under certain circumstances, including the borrower&#8217;s use of certain loan proceeds to fund employee payroll during a specific period (i.e. eight weeks, 24 weeks) following disbursement of the borrower&#8217;s PPP loan. The SBA continues to issue guidance as to the administration of the loan forgiveness and guaranty process. The Company generated net fees of $91.0 million to be recognized over the life of the PPP loan adjusted for estimated prepayments. 

All of our three primary business segments, community banking, specialty finance and wealth management, have been uniquely impacted and will likely continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring the implementation of certain responses as circumstances evolve. As non-exclusive examples of such impacts, our community banking business, including our mortgage business, has received borrower requests for temporary payment relief including payment deferrals. As of June 30, 2020, loans totaling approximately $1.7 billion were modified as a result of COVID-19 disruption to our borrowers. Our insurance premium finance business is impacted by certain state legislation prohibiting canceling of insurance policies for designated periods. Our wealth management business is impacted by factors including increased stock market volatility. 

Given the continued uncertainty regarding future economic conditions, the Company continues to take actions to help ensure that it has adequate liquidity and capital to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary suspension of our common stock repurchase program and the issuance of fixed-rate reset non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series E, liquidation preference $25,000 per share (the &#8220;Series E Preferred Stock&#8221;) as part of a public offering of depositary shares, each 

representing a 1/1,000 th interest in a share of Series E Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Depositary Shares&#8221;). We believe the Company currently has adequate liquidity and capital to effectively manage through the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we will continue to prudently evaluate and expand liquidity sources, including the possible utilization of the PPP liquidity facility, if necessary. 

We continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 closely; however, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our operations and financial conditions remains highly uncertain. Please also refer to Part II, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 

&#160; 

Second Quarter Highlights 

The Company recorded net income of $21.7 million for the second quarter of 2020 compared to $81.5 million in the second quarter of 2019 . The results for the second quarter of 2020 demonstrate continued momentum on our operating strengths including strong loan and deposit growth driven by the Company's participation in PPP, and increased revenue from mortgage banking services, offset by increased provision for credit losses primarily related to the implementation of CECL and the economic conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Net interest income decreased in the current period as a result of a decrease in net interest margin partially mitigated by continued loan growth in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 . 

The Company increased its loan portfolio from $25.3 billion at June 30, 2019 and $26.8 billion at December 31, 2019 to $31.4 billion at June 30, 2020 . The increase in the current period compared to the prior periods was primarily a result of the Company&#8217;s participation in PPP lending as well as growth in commercial premium finance receivables and life insurance premium finance receivables portfolios. For more information regarding changes in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio, see Financial Condition &#8211; Interest Earning Assets and Note 6 - Loans of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report. 

The Company recorded net interest income of $263.1 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $266.2 million in the second quarter of 2019 . The decrease in net interest income recorded in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019 resulted primarily from a lower net interest margin of 2.73% (2.74% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 3.62% (3.64% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) in the second quarter of 2019. The reduction in net interest margin was partially offset by a $5.8 billion increase in average loans, and a $3.0 billion increase in average liquidity management assets (see "Net Interest Income" for further detail). 

Non-interest income totaled $162.0 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $98.2 million in the second quarter of 2019 . This increase was primarily the result of higher mortgage banking revenue (see &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; for further detail). 

Non-interest expense totaled $259.4 million in the second quarter of 2020 , increasing $29.8 million , or 13 %, compared to the second quarter of 2019 . The increase compared to the second quarter of 2019 was primarily attributable to addition of employees from acquisitions, increased staffing as the Company grows and higher commissions and incentive compensation due to increased origination volume associated with the Company's mortgage business (see &#8220;Non-Interest Expense&#8221; for further detail). 

Management considers the maintenance of adequate liquidity to be important to the management of risk. During the second quarter of 2020 , the Company continued its practice of maintaining appropriate funding capacity to provide the Company with adequate liquidity for its ongoing operations. In this regard, the Company benefited from its strong deposit base, a liquid short-term investment portfolio and its access to funding from a variety of external funding sources. At June 30, 2020 , the Company had approximately $4.4 billion in overnight liquid funds and interest-bearing deposits with banks. Total cash inflows by the Company during the first six months of 2020 were offset by $220.8 million in cash collateral posted to unaffiliated derivative counterparties in which the Company held a net liability position in such derivative transactions as well as the origination of mortgage loans pending the ultimate sale of such loans into the secondary market following June 30, 2020.

Net revenue is net interest income plus non-interest income. 

(2) 

See following section titled, &#8220;Supplementary Financial Measures/Ratios&#8221; for additional information on this performance measure/ratio. 

(3) 

The net overhead ratio is calculated by netting total non-interest expense and total non-interest income, annualizing this amount, and dividing by that period&#8217;s total average assets. A lower ratio indicates a higher degree of efficiency. 

Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, and quarterly growth rates are &#8220;annualized&#8221; throughout this report to represent an annual time period. This is done for analytical purposes to better discern for decision-making purposes underlying performance trends when compared to full-year or year-over-year amounts. For example, balance sheet growth rates are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate. As such, 5% growth during a quarter would represent an annualized growth rate of 20%. 

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL MEASURES/RATIOS 

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company&#8217;s performance. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components), taxable-equivalent net interest margin (including its individual components), the taxable-equivalent efficiency ratio, tangible common equity ratio, tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible common equity and pre-tax income, excluding provision for credit losses and pre-tax income, excluding provision for credit losses and MSR valuation adjustment. Management believes that these measures and ratios provide users of the Company&#8217;s financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and of the Company&#8217;s operating efficiency. Other financial holding companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently. 

Management reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis using tax rates effective as of the end of the period. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is also used in the calculation of the Company&#8217;s efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by total taxable-equivalent net revenue (less securities gains or losses), measures how much it costs to produce one dollar of revenue. Securities gains or losses are excluded from this calculation to better match revenue from daily operations to operational expenses. Management considers the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share as useful measurements of the Company&#8217;s equity. The Company references the return on average tangible common equity as a measurement of profitability. Management considers (i) pre-tax income excluding provision for credit losses and (ii) pre-tax income excluding provision for credit losses and MSR valuation adjustment as useful measurements of the Company's core net income. 

A reconciliation of certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios used by the Company to evaluate and measure the Company&#8217;s performance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is shown below:

Critical Accounting Policies 

The Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States and prevailing practices of the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Certain policies and accounting principles inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments, and as such have a greater possibility that changes in those estimates and assumptions could produce financial results that are materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event, are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates and assumptions. Management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions, and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the financial statements. Management currently views critical accounting policies to include the determination of the allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for losses on lending-related commitments, loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination, estimations of fair value, the valuations required for impairment testing of goodwill, the valuation and accounting for derivative instruments and income taxes as the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. For a more detailed discussion on these critical accounting policies, see &#8220;Summary of Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; beginning on page 53 of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K. 

The COVID-19 pandemic, specifically the uncertainty related to the ultimate magnitude of impact on the economy and banking industry, is expected to impact many of the estimates, assumptions, and judgments noted above that are used by management. This could result in volatility in the related accounting estimates, which will directly impact the Company's financial results. Please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Overview section of this report for additional discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic . 

Net Income 

Net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 totaled $21.7 million , a decrease of $59.8 million , or 73% , compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2019. On a per share basis, net income for the second quarter of 2020 totaled $0.34 per diluted common share compared to $1.38 for the second quarter of 2019 . 

The most significant factors impacting net income for the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year include an increase in the provision for credit losses as a result of the adoption of CECL and economic conditions created by the COVID&#8211;19 pandemic as well as increased salaries and employee benefits expense, partially offset by increased mortgage banking revenue. See "Net Interest Income", "Non-interest Income", "Non-interest Expense" and "Loan Portfolio and Asset Quality" for further detail. 

Net Interest Income 

The primary source of the Company&#8217;s revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earnings assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on the liabilities to fund those assets, including interest bearing deposits and other borrowings. The amount of net interest income is affected by both changes in the level of interest rates, and the amount and composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. 

Quarter Ended June 30, 2020 compared to the Quarters Ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019 

The following table presents a summary of the Company&#8217;s average balances, net interest income and related net interest margins, including a calculation on a fully taxable equivalent basis, for the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the first quarter of 2020 (sequential quarters) and second quarter of 2019 (linked quarters):

Interest income on tax-advantaged loans, trading securities and investment securities reflects a tax-equivalent adjustment based on the marginal federal corporate tax rate in effect as of the applicable period. The total adjustments for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019 were $2.5 million and $3.2 million , respectively.

Interest rate spread is the difference between the yield earned on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. 

(7) 

Net free funds are the difference between total average earning assets and total average interest-bearing liabilities. The estimated contribution to net interest margin from net free funds is calculated using the rate paid for total interest-bearing liabilities. 

(8) 

See &#8220;Supplemental Financial Measures/Ratios&#8221; for additional information on this performance ratio. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2020, net interest income totaled $524.6 million , a decrease of $3.6 million as compared to the first six months of 2019. Net interest margin was 2.91% ( 2.93% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 3.66% ( 3.68% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) for the same period of 2019 . The decrease in net interest margin compared to the first six months of 2019 is primarily the result of a decrease in the yield earned on interest earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities.

Notable contributions to the change in non-interest income are as follows: 

Wealth management revenue decreased in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the second quarter of 2019 due to a decline in asset management fees and brokerage commissions. Declines in asset management and trust fees are primarily due to volatile equity markets since year end. Brokerage commissions were negatively impacted in the second quarter of 2020 due to lower transactional volume as compared to the prior year quarter. Wealth management revenue is comprised of the trust and asset management revenue of The Chicago Trust Company and Great Lakes Advisors, the brokerage commissions, managed money fees and insurance product commissions at Wintrust Investments and fees from tax-deferred like-kind exchange services provided by the Chicago Deferred Exchange Company. 

Mortgage banking revenue increased in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the second quarter of 2019 as a result of an increase in loans originated for sale and higher production revenue. Mortgage loans originated for sale totaled $2.2 billion in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2019 . Mortgage banking revenue includes revenue from activities related to originating, selling and servicing residential real estate loans for the secondary market. Mortgage revenue is also impacted by changes in the fair value of MSRs. The Company records MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis. 

During the second quarter of 2020 , the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio decreased due to a negative fair value adjustment of $8.0 million as well as a reduction in value of $8.7 million due to payoffs and paydowns of the existing portfolio, partially offset by the gain on interest rate swaps held as an economic hedge of $589,000 and the capitalization of MSRs in the current period of $20.4 million . Starting in 2019, the Company purchased options and entered into interest rate swaps to economically hedge a portion of the fair value changes recorded in earnings related to its MSRs portfolio. During the second quarter of 2020 , the Company terminated these interest rate swaps. There were no such options or interest rate swaps outstanding as of June 30, 2020 . 

The table below presents additional selected information regarding mortgage banking for the respective periods.

(1) 

Certain volume adjusted for the estimated pull-through rate of the loan, which represents the Company&#8217;s best estimate of the likelihood that a committed loan will ultimately fund. 

(2) 

Production revenue represents revenue earned from the origination and subsequent sale of mortgages, including gains on loans sold and fees from originations, processing and other related activities, and excludes servicing fees, changes in the fair value of servicing rights and changes to the mortgage recourse obligation and other non-production revenue. 

The Company has typically written call options with terms of less than three months against certain U.S. Treasury and agency securities held in its portfolio for liquidity and other purposes. Management has entered into these transactions with the goal of economically hedging security positions and enhancing its overall return on its investment portfolio by using fees generated from these options to compensate for net interest margin compression. These option transactions are designed to mitigate overall interest rate risk and do not qualify as hedges pursuant to accounting guidance. There were no outstanding call option contracts at June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019 .

Notable contributions to the change in non-interest expense are as follows: 

Salaries and employee benefits expense increased in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019 primarily as a result of the addition of employees from acquisitions, increased staffing as the Company grows and higher commissions and incentive compensation due to increased origination volume associated with the Company's mortgage business. 

Equipment expense increased in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019 as a result of higher software license fees, software and computer depreciation expense. 

Data processing expense increased in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019 primarily as a result of the $4.5 million of conversion costs associated with the Countryside Bank acquisition. 

Advertising and marketing expenses decreased in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019 as a result of decreased sponsorship costs due to the cancellation of events, including sports sponsorships, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Marketing costs are incurred to promote the Company's brand, commercial banking capabilities, the Company's various products, to attract loans and deposits and to announce new branch openings as well as the expansion of the Company's non-bank businesses. The level of marketing expenditures depends on the timing of sponsorship programs utilized which are determined based on the market area, targeted audience, competition and various other factors. 

FDIC insurance expense increased in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019 as a result of higher assessment rates impacted by declines in the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio at the Company's bank affiliates as a result of asset growth, including PPP loans. 

Other miscellaneous expense increased in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019 primarily as a result of increased contingent consideration expense accrued in the second quarter of 2020 related to the previous acquisitions of mortgage operations. The increase in the contingent consideration accrual is a result of higher anticipated payments resulting from increases in both current and forecasted revenues related to the acquired businesses due to the favorable mortgage banking environment. Miscellaneous expense includes ATM expenses, correspondent bank charges, directors' fees, telephone, travel and entertainment, corporate insurance, dues and subscriptions, problem loan expenses, operating losses and lending origination costs that are not deferred.

The Company recorded income tax expense of $9.0 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $28.7 million in the second quarter of 2019 . The effective tax rates were 29.46% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 26.06% in the second quarter of 2019 . During the first six months of 2020, the Company recorded income tax expense of $33.3 million compared to $58.2 million for the first six months of 2019. The effective tax rates were 28.28% for the first six months of 2020 and 25.44% for the first six months of 2019. 

The higher effective tax rates in the 2020 quarterly and year-to-date periods compared to 2019 were a result of a higher level of nondeductible expenses net of tax-exempt income relative to pretax net income in the 2020 periods. The increase in the year-to-date rate was also impacted by the tax effects related to share-based compensation. The tax effects of share-based compensation fluctuate based on the Company&#8217;s stock price and timing of employee stock option exercises and vesting of other share-based awards. The Company recorded additional tax expense related to share-based compensation of $521,000 in the first six months of 2020, and tax benefits of $1.6 million in the first six months of 2019, the majority of which was recognized in the first quarter of each year. 

Operating Segment Results 

As described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1, the Company&#8217;s operations consist of three primary segments: community banking, specialty finance and wealth management. The Company&#8217;s profitability is primarily dependent on the net interest income, provision for credit losses, non-interest income and operating expenses of its community banking segment. For purposes of internal segment profitability, management allocates certain intersegment and parent company balances. Management allocates a portion of revenues to the specialty finance segment related to loans and leases originated by the specialty finance segment and sold or assigned to the community banking segment. Similarly, for purposes of analyzing the contribution from the wealth management segment, management allocates a portion of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on deposit balances of customers of the wealth management segment to the wealth management segment. Finally, expenses incurred at the Wintrust parent company are allocated to each segment based on each segment's risk-weighted assets. 

The community banking segment&#8217;s net interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 totaled $205.7 million as compared to $214.3 million for the same period in 2019 , a decrease of $8.6 million , or 4% . On a year-to-date basis, net interest income for the segment decreased by $13.2 million from $425.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to $412.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 . The decrease in the three and six month periods is primarily attributable to compression of the net interest margin attributable to the decrease in interest rates in the environment. The community banking segment&#8217;s non-interest income totaled $129.7 million in the second quarter of 2020 , an increase of $64.3 million , or 98% , when compared to the second quarter of 2019 total of $65.4 million . On a year-to-date basis, non-interest income totaled $210.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 , an increase of $97.1 million , or 85% , compared to $113.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 . The increase in the three and six month periods is primarily the result of increased mortgage banking revenue from significantly increased mortgage originations during 2020. The community banking segment&#8217;s net loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 totaled $7.3 million , a decrease of $60.8 million as compared to net income in the second quarter of 2019 of $53.4 million . On a year-to-date basis, the community banking segment's net income was $27.3 million for the first six months of 2020 as compared to $113.8 million for the first six months of 2019. The decrease in net income in the three and six month periods is primarily attributable to higher provision for credit losses in 2020 due to the implementation of CECL and the macroeconomic conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Overview section of this report for additional discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The specialty finance segment's net interest income totaled $42.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 , compared to $39.4 million for the same period in 2019 , an increase of $3.0 million , or 8% . On a year-to-date basis, net interest income increased by $6.0 million in the first six months of 2020 as compared to the first six months of 2019. The increase in the three and six month periods is primarily attributable to growth in earning assets on the premium finance receivables portfolios. The specialty finance segment&#8217;s non-interest income totaled $21.8 million and $19.6 million for the three month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. On a year-to-date basis, non-interest income increased by $4.0 million in the first six months of 2020 as compared to the first six months of 2019. The increase in non-interest income in the three and six month periods is primarily the result of higher originations and increased balances related to the commercial premium finance portfolio and growth in business from the Company's leasing division. Our commercial premium finance operations, life insurance finance operations, lease financing operations and accounts receivable finance operations accounted for 41%, 32%, 23% and 4%, respectively, of the total revenues of our specialty finance business for the six month period ended June 30, 2020 . The net income of the specialty finance segment for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 totaled $22.7 million as compared to $21.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 . On a year-to-date basis, the net income of the specialty finance segment for the six months ended June 30, 2020 totaled $44.8 million as compared to $43.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 . 

The wealth management segment reported net interest income of $8.6 million for the second quarter of 2020 compared to $6.9 million in the same quarter of 2019 , an increase of $1.7 million , or 24% . On a year-to-date basis, net interest income totaled $16.4 million for the first six months of 2020 as compared to $14.4 million for the first six months of 2019. Net interest income for this segment is primarily comprised of an allocation of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on non-interest bearing and interest-bearing wealth management customer account balances on deposit at the banks. Wealth management customer account balances on deposit at the banks averaged $2.0 billion and $1.6 billion in the first six months of 2020 and 2019 , respectively. This segment recorded non-interest income of $24.5 million for the second quarter of 2020 compared to $25.0 million for the second quarter of 2019 . On a year-to-date basis, the wealth management segment's non-interest income totaled $48.6 million during the first six months of 2020 as compared to $50.0 million in the first six months of 2019. Distribution of wealth management services through each bank continues to be a focus of the Company. The Company is committed to growing the wealth management segment in order to better service its customers and create a more diversified revenue stream. The wealth management segment&#8217;s net income totaled $6.3 million for the second quarter of 2020 compared to $6.9 million for the second quarter of 2019 . On a year-to-date basis, the wealth management segment's net income totaled $12.4 million and $13.9 million for the six month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. 

Financial Condition 

Total assets were $43.5 billion at June 30, 2020 , representing an increase of $9.9 billion , or 29% , when compared to June 30, 2019 and an increase of approximately $4.7 billion , or 25% on an annualized basis, when compared to March 31, 2020 . Total funding, which includes deposits, all notes and advances, including secured borrowings and the junior subordinated debentures, was $38.1 billion at June 30, 2020 , $33.8 billion at March 31, 2020 , and $29.2 billion at June 30, 2019 . See Notes 5, 6, 10, 11 and 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for additional period-end detail on the Company&#8217;s interest-earning assets and funding liabilities.

Mortgage loans held-for-sale. Average mortgage loans held-for-sale totaled $ 705.7 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared to $ 403.3 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $ 281.7 million in the second quarter of 2019. By selling residential mortgage loans into the secondary market, the Company eliminates the interest-rate risk associated with these loans, as they are predominantly long-term fixed rate loans, and provides a source of non-interest revenue. The increase in average balances compared to both periods was primarily the result of increased mortgage demand associated with historically low long-term interest rates. 

Loans, net of unearned income. Average total loans, net of unearned income, totaled $30.3 billion in the second quarter of 2020 , increasing $5.8 billion , or 24% , from the second quarter of 2019 and $3.4 billion , or 51% on an annualized basis, from the first quarter of 2020 . Combined, the commercial and commercial real estate loan categories comprised 64% of the average loan portfolio in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to 61% in the first quarter of 2020 and 62% in the second quarter of 2019 . Growth realized in these aggregated categories for the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the sequential and prior year periods is primarily attributable to PPP lending and increased business development efforts. Additionally, growth realized in the second quarter 2020 as compared to the second quarter 2019 was partially attributable to the acquisition of ROC, SBC and STC in 2019 and originations of PPP loans in the second quarter 2020 . 

Home equity loan portfolio averaged $478.3 million in the second quarter of 2020 , and decreased $49.5 million , or 9% from the average balance of $527.8 million in same period of 2019 . The decrease in the home equity loan portfolio is primarily the result 

of borrowers preferring to finance through longer term, low rate mortgage loans. The Company has been actively managing its home equity portfolio to ensure that diligent pricing, appraisal and other underwriting activities continue to exist. 

Residential real estate loans averaged $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2020 , and increased $228.2 million , or 23% from the average balance of $995.4 million in same period of 2019 . Additionally, compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2020 , the average balance decreased $19.4 million , or 6% on an annualized basis. The Company's residential real estate portfolio predominantly includes one- to four-family adjustable rate mortgage loans that have repricing terms generally from one to three years, construction loans to individuals and bridge financing loans for qualifying customers. 

Average premium finance receivables totaled $9.0 billion in the second quarter of 2020 , and accounted for 30% of the Company&#8217;s average total loans. The increase during the second quarter of 2020 compared to both the first quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2019 was the result of continued originations within the portfolio in part due to hardening insurance market conditions increasing the average size of new commercial insurance premium finance receivables to approximately $38,000 in the second quarter of 2020. Approximately $3.1 billion of premium finance receivables were originated in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $2.4 billion during the same period of 2019 . Premium finance receivables consist of a commercial portfolio and a life portfolio comprising approximately 41% and 59% , respectively, of the average total balance of premium finance receivables for the second quarter of 2020 , and 41% and 59% , respectively, for the second quarter of 2019 . 

Other loans represent a wide variety of personal and consumer loans to individuals. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk due to the type and nature of the collateral. 

Total average loans for the first six months of 2020 increased $4.4 billion or 18% over the previous year period. Similar to the quarterly discussion above, approximately $1.9 billion of this increase relates to the commercial portfolio including PPP loans, $1.1 billion of this increase relates to the commercial real estate portfolio and $1.2 billion of this increase relates to the premium finance receivables portfolio. 

Liquidity management assets. Funds that are not utilized for loan originations are used to purchase investment securities and short term money market investments, to sell as federal funds and to maintain in interest bearing deposits with banks. The balances of these assets can fluctuate based on management&#8217;s ongoing effort to manage liquidity and for asset liability management purposes. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company will continue to prudently evaluate and utilize liquidity sources as needed, including the management of availability with the FHLB and FRB and utilization of the revolving credit facility with unaffiliated banks. Please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Overview and - Liquidity sections of this report for additional discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Other earning assets. Other earning assets include brokerage customer receivables and trading account securities. In the normal course of business, Wintrust Investments activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing of various securities transactions. Wintrust Investments customer securities activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis. In margin transactions, Wintrust Investments, under an agreement with an out-sourced securities firm, extends credit to its customers, subject to various regulatory and internal margin requirements, collateralized by cash and securities in customer&#8217;s accounts. In connection with these activities, Wintrust Investments executes and the out-sourced firm clears customer transactions relating to the sale of securities not yet purchased, substantially all of which are transacted on a margin basis subject to individual exchange regulations. Such transactions may expose Wintrust Investments to off-balance-sheet risk, particularly in volatile trading markets, in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur. In the event a customer fails to satisfy its obligations, Wintrust Investments under the agreement with the outsourced securities firm, may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market prices to fulfill the customer&#8217;s obligations. Wintrust Investments seeks to control the risks associated with its customers&#8217; activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulatory and internal guidelines. Wintrust Investments monitors required margin levels daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral or to reduce positions when necessary.

We make commercial loans for many purposes, including working capital lines, which are generally renewable annually and supported by business assets, personal guarantees and additional collateral. In addition, the Company has participated in PPP starting in the second quarter of 2020 as a result of COVID-19 disruption to the economy. Commercial business lending is generally considered to involve a slightly higher degree of risk than traditional consumer bank lending. Primarily as a result of the adoption of CECL and deterioration in macroeconomic conditions related to COVID-19, our allowance for credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio increased to $133.6 million as of June 30, 2020 compared to $74.9 million as of June 30, 2019 . 

Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by a first mortgage lien and assignment of rents on the property. Since most of our bank branches are located in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin, 84.9% of our commercial real estate loan portfolio is located in this region as of June 30, 2020 . We have been able to effectively manage our total non-performing commercial real estate loans. As of June 30, 2020 , our allowance for credit losses related to this portfolio is $197.1 million compared to $63.3 million as of June 30, 2019 . Similar to the commercial loan portfolio, the increase in the allowance for credit losses is primarily due to the adoption of CECL and deterioration in macroeconomic conditions related to COVID-19 . 

The Company also participates in mortgage warehouse lending, which is included above within commercial, industrial and other, by providing interim funding to unaffiliated mortgage bankers to finance residential mortgages originated by such bankers for sale into the secondary market. The Company&#8217;s loans to the mortgage bankers are secured by the business assets of the mortgage companies as well as the specific mortgage loans funded by the Company, after they have been pre-approved for purchase by third party end lenders. The Company may also provide interim financing for packages of mortgage loans on a bulk basis in circumstances where the mortgage bankers desire to competitively bid on a number of mortgages for sale as a package in the secondary market. Amounts advanced with respect to any particular mortgage loan are usually required to be repaid within 21 days. 

Home equity loans. Our home equity loans and lines of credit are originated by each of our banks in their local markets where we have a strong understanding of the underlying real estate value. Our banks monitor and manage these loans, and we conduct an automated review of all home equity loans and lines of credit at least twice per year. This review collects current credit performance 

for each home equity borrower and identifies situations where the credit strength of the borrower is declining, or where there are events that may influence repayment, such as tax liens or judgments. Our banks use this information to manage loans that may be higher risk and to determine whether to obtain additional credit information or updated property valuations. 

The rates we offer on new home equity lending are based on several factors, including appraisals and valuation due diligence, in order to reflect inherent risk, and we place additional scrutiny on larger home equity requests. In a limited number of cases, we issue home equity credit together with first mortgage financing, and requests for such financing are evaluated on a combined basis. It is not our practice to advance more than 85% of the appraised value of the underlying asset, which ratio we refer to as the loan-to-value ratio, or LTV ratio, and a majority of the credit we previously extended, when issued, had an LTV ratio of less than 80%. 

Our home equity loan portfolio has performed well in light of the ongoing volatility in the overall residential real estate market. 

Residential real estate. Our residential real estate portfolio predominantly includes one- to four-family adjustable rate mortgages, construction loans to individuals and bridge financing loans for qualifying customers. As of June 30, 2020 , our residential loan portfolio totaled $1.4 billion , or 5% of our total outstanding loans. 

Our adjustable rate mortgages relate to properties located principally in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin or vacation homes owned by local residents. These adjustable rate mortgages are often non-agency conforming. Adjustable rate mortgage loans decrease the interest rate risk we face on our mortgage portfolio. However, this risk is not eliminated due to the fact that such loans generally provide for periodic and lifetime limits on the interest rate adjustments among other features. Additionally, adjustable rate mortgages may pose a higher risk of delinquency and default because they require borrowers to make larger payments when interest rates rise. As of June 30, 2020 , $19.5 million of our residential real estate mortgages, or 1.4% of our residential real estate loan portfolio were classified as nonaccrual, no loans were 90 or more days past due and still accruing, $5.9 million were 30 to 89 days past due (0.4%) and $1.4 billion were current (98.2%). We believe that since our loan portfolio consists primarily of locally originated loans, and since the majority of our borrowers are longer-term customers with lower LTV ratios, we face a relatively low risk of borrower default and delinquency. 

While we generally do not originate loans for our own portfolio with long-term fixed rates due to interest rate risk considerations, we can accommodate customer requests for fixed rate loans by originating such loans and then selling them into the secondary market, for which we receive fee income. We may also selectively retain certain of these loans within the banks&#8217; own portfolios where they are non-agency conforming, or where the terms of the loans make them favorable to retain. A portion of the loans we sold into the secondary market were sold with the servicing of those loans retained. The amount of loans serviced for others as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 was $9.2 billion and $7.5 billion , respectively. All other mortgage loans sold into the secondary market were sold without the retention of servicing rights. 

The Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA") optional repurchase programs allow financial institutions acting as servicers to buy back individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the institution was the original transferor of such loans. At the option of the servicer and without prior authorization from GNMA, the servicer may repurchase such delinquent loans for an amount equal to the remaining principal balance of the loan. Under FASB ASC Topic 860, &#8220;Transfers and Servicing,&#8221; this buy-back option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met, at which time the option becomes unconditional. When the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans under the unconditional repurchase option and the expected benefit of the potential repurchase is more than trivial, the loans can no longer be reported as sold and must be brought back onto the balance sheet as loans, regardless of whether the Company intends to exercise the buy-back option. These loans are reported as loans held-for-investment, part of the residential real estate portfolio, with the offsetting liability being reported in accrued interest payable and other liabilities. Rebooked GNMA loans held-for-investment amounted to $240.7 million at June 30, 2020 , compared to $95.6 million balance at June 30, 2019 . 

It is not our current practice to underwrite, and we have no plans to underwrite, subprime, Alt A, no or little documentation loans, or option ARM loans. As of June 30, 2020 , approximately $977,000 of our mortgage loans consist of interest-only loans. 

Premium finance receivables &#8211; commercial. FIRST Insurance Funding and FIFC Canada originated approximately $2.8 billion in commercial insurance premium finance receivables in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to $2.2 billion of originations in the second quarter of 2019 . During the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, FIRST Insurance Funding and FIFC Canada originated approximately $4.9 billion and $4.1 billion , respectively, in commercial insurance premium finance receivables. FIRST Insurance Funding and FIFC Canada make loans to businesses to finance the insurance premiums they pay on their commercial insurance policies. The loans are originated by working through independent medium and large insurance agents and brokers located throughout the United States and Canada. The insurance premiums financed are primarily for commercial customers&#8217; purchases of liability, property and casualty and other commercial insurance. 

This lending involves relatively rapid turnover of the loan portfolio and high volume of loan originations. Because of the indirect nature of this lending through third party agents and brokers and because the borrowers are located nationwide and in Canada, this segment is more susceptible to third party fraud than relationship lending. The Company performs ongoing credit and other reviews of the agents and brokers, and performs various internal audit steps to mitigate against the risk of any fraud. The majority of these loans are purchased by the banks in order to more fully utilize their lending capacity as these loans generally provide the banks with higher yields than alternative investments. 

Premium finance receivables&#8212;life insurance. Wintrust Life Finance originated approximately $354.3 million in life insurance premium finance receivables in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to $230.9 million of originations in the second quarter of 2019 . During the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, Wintrust Life Finance originated approximately $645.2 million and $474.9 million , respectively, in life insurance premium finance receivables. The Company continues to experience increased competition and pricing pressure within the current market. These loans are originated directly with the borrowers with assistance from life insurance carriers, independent insurance agents, financial advisors and legal counsel. The life insurance policy is the primary form of collateral. In addition, these loans often are secured with a letter of credit, marketable securities or certificates of deposit. In some cases, Wintrust Life Finance may make a loan that has a partially unsecured position. 

Consumer and other. Included in the consumer and other loan category is a wide variety of personal and consumer loans to individuals. The banks originate consumer loans in order to provide a wider range of financial services to their customers. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk than mortgage loans due to the type and nature of the collateral.

Past Due Loans and Non-Performing Assets 

Our ability to manage credit risk depends in large part on our ability to properly identify and manage problem loans. To do so, the Company operates a credit risk rating system under which our credit management personnel assign a credit risk rating to each loan at the time of origination and review loans on a regular basis to determine each loan&#8217;s credit risk rating on a scale of 1 through 10 with higher scores indicating higher risk. The credit risk rating structure used is shown below: 

&#160; 

1 Rating &#8212; 

&#160; 

Minimal Risk (Loss Potential &#8211; none or extremely low) (Superior asset quality, excellent liquidity, minimal leverage) 

&#160; 

&#160; 

2 Rating &#8212; 

&#160; 

Modest Risk (Loss Potential demonstrably low) (Very good asset quality and liquidity, strong leverage capacity) 

&#160; 

&#160; 

3 Rating &#8212; 

&#160; 

Average Risk (Loss Potential low but no longer refutable) (Mostly satisfactory asset quality and liquidity, good leverage capacity) 

&#160;

Loss (fully charged-off) (Loans in this category are considered fully uncollectible.) 

Each loan officer is responsible for monitoring his or her loan portfolio, recommending a credit risk rating for each loan in his or her portfolio and ensuring the credit risk ratings are appropriate. These credit risk ratings are then ratified by the bank&#8217;s chief credit officer and/or concurrence credit officer. Credit risk ratings are determined by evaluating a number of factors including a borrower&#8217;s financial strength, cash flow coverage, collateral protection and guarantees. A third party loan review firm independently reviews a significant portion of the loan portfolio at each of the Company&#8217;s subsidiary banks to evaluate the appropriateness of the management-assigned credit risk ratings. These ratings are subject to further review at each of our bank subsidiaries by the applicable regulatory authority, including the FRB of Chicago and the OCC, and are also reviewed by our internal audit staff. 

The Company&#8217;s Problem Loan Reporting system includes all loans with credit risk ratings of 6 through 9. This system is designed to provide an on-going detailed tracking mechanism for each problem loan. Once management determines that a loan has deteriorated to a point where it has a credit risk rating of 6 or worse, the Company&#8217;s Managed Asset Division performs an overall credit and collateral review. As part of this review, all underlying collateral is identified and the valuation methodology is analyzed and tracked. As a result of this initial review by the Company&#8217;s Managed Asset Division, the credit risk rating is reviewed and a portion of the outstanding loan balance may be deemed uncollectible and, as a result, no longer share similar risk characteristics as its related pool. If that is the case, the individual loan is considered collateral dependent and individually assessed for an allowance for credit loss. The Company&#8217;s individual assessment utilizes an independent re-appraisal of the collateral (unless such a third-party evaluation is not possible due to the unique nature of the collateral, such as a closely-held business or thinly traded securities). In the case of commercial real estate collateral, an independent third party appraisal is ordered by the Company&#8217;s Real Estate Services Group to determine if there has been any change in the underlying collateral value. These independent appraisals are reviewed by the Real Estate Services Group and sometimes by independent third party valuation experts and may be adjusted depending upon market conditions. 

Through the credit risk rating process, loans are reviewed to determine if they are performing in accordance with the original contractual terms. If the borrower has failed to comply with the original contractual terms, further action may be required by the Company, including a downgrade in the credit risk rating, movement to non-accrual status or a charge-off. If the Company determines that a loan amount or portion thereof is uncollectible, the loan&#8217;s credit risk rating is immediately downgraded to an 8 

or 9 and the uncollectible amount is charged-off. Any loan that has a partial charge-off continues to be assigned a credit risk rating of an 8 or 9 for the duration of time that a balance remains outstanding. The Company undertakes a thorough and ongoing analysis to determine if additional impairment and/or charge-offs are appropriate and to begin a workout plan for the credit to minimize actual losses. In determining the appropriate charge-off for collateral-dependent loans, the Company considers the results of appraisals for the associated collateral. 

The Company&#8217;s approach to workout plans and restructuring loans is built on the credit-risk rating process. A modification of a loan with an existing credit risk rating of 6 or worse or a modification of any other credit, which will result in a restructured credit risk rating of 6 or worse must be reviewed for TDR classification. In that event, our Managed Assets Division conducts an overall credit and collateral review. A modification of a loan is considered to be a TDR if both (1) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and (2) for economic or legal reasons, the bank grants a concession to a borrower that it would not otherwise consider. The modification of a loan where the credit risk rating is 5 or better both before and after such modification is not considered to be a TDR. Based on the Company&#8217;s credit risk rating system, it considers that borrowers whose credit risk rating is 5 or better are not experiencing financial difficulties and therefore, are not considered TDRs. 

TDRs are individually assessed at the time of the modification and on a quarterly basis to measure an allowance for credit loss. The carrying amount of the loan is compared to the expected payments to be received, discounted at the loan's original rate, or for collateral dependent loans, to the fair value of the collateral. Any shortfall is recorded as a reserve. 

For non-TDR loans, if based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due to it according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, a loan is individually assessed for measuring the allowance for credit losses and if necessary, a reserve is established. In determining the appropriate reserve for collateral-dependent loans, the Company considers the results of appraisals for the associated collateral. 

Non-performing Assets 

The following table sets forth the Company's non-performing assets and TDRs performing under the contractual terms of the loan agreement as of the dates shown. Prior to January 1, 2020, PCI loans were aggregated into pools by common risk characteristics for accounting purposes, including recognition of interest income on a pool basis. As a result of the implementation of CECL, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, PCI loans transitioned to a classification of PCD loans, which no longer maintains the prior pools and related accounting concepts. Recognition of interest income on PCD loans is considered at the individual asset level following the Company's accrual policies, instead of based upon the entire pool of loans. Due to the first quarter of 2020 adoption of CECL, the Company included $30.3 million and $35.4 million in non-performing PCD loans in total non-performing loans as of June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.

Non-accrual loans included TDRs totaling $34.9 million, $36.6 million, $27.1 million and $30.1 million as of June 30, 2020 , March 31, 2020 , December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 , respectively. 

(3) 

Includes PCD loans. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the Company transitioned all previously classified PCI loans to PCD loans effective January 1, 2020. 

State emergency orders and pandemic delays on processing of return premiums, which serve as our collateral, contributed to the increase in 90 day past due premium finance receivables. Management is pursuing the resolution of all credits in this category. At this time, management believes reserves are appropriate to absorb losses that are expected upon the ultimate resolution of these credits. While the ultimate effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on non-performing assets remains unknown, significant increases may occur in subsequent periods. Management will continue to actively review and monitor its loan portfolios, in an effort to identify problem credits in a timely manner. Please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Overview section of this report for additional discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Includes PCD loans and, for periods prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, purchased credit impaired ("PCI") loans. PCI loans represented loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination, in accordance with ASC 310-30. Loan agings disclosed in comparative periods are based upon contractually required payments. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the Company transitioned all previously classified PCI loans to PCD loans effective January 1, 2020. 

As of June 30, 2020 , $79.3 million of all loans, or 0.3%, were 60 to 89 days past due and $166.4 million of all loans or 0.5%, were 30 to 59 days (or one payment) past due. As of March 31, 2020 , $33.0 million of all loans or 0.1%, were 60 to 89 days past due and $262.7 million, or 0.9%, were 30 to 59 days (or one payment) past due. Many of the commercial and commercial real estate loans shown as 60 to 89 days and 30 to 59 days past due are included on the Company&#8217;s internal problem loan reporting system. Loans on this system are closely monitored by management on a monthly basis. 

The Company's home equity and residential loan portfolios continue to exhibit low delinquency ratios. Home equity loans at June 30, 2020 that were current with regard to the contractual terms of the loan agreement represent 98.2% of the total home equity 

portfolio. Residential real estate loans at June 30, 2020 that were current with regards to the contractual terms of the loan agreements comprise 98.2% of total residential real estate loans outstanding.

Prior to January 1, 2020, PCI loans were excluded from non-performing loans as they continued to earn interest income from the related accretable yield, independent of performance with contractual terms of the loan. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2020, the Company transitioned all previously classified PCI loans to PCD loans, which no longer maintain the prior pools and related accounting concepts. Specifically, recognition of interest income on PCD loans is considered at the individual asset level following the Company's accrual policies, instead of based upon the entire pool of loans. As such, after adoption, the Company includes PCD loans in total non-performing loans. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses, specifically the allowance for loans losses and the allowance for unfunded commitment losses, represents management&#8217;s estimate of lifetime expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is determined quarterly using a methodology that incorporates important risk characteristics of each loan, as described below under &#8220;How We Determine the Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; in this Item 2. This process is subject to review at each of our bank subsidiaries by the applicable regulatory authority, including the FRB of Chicago, and the OCC. 

Management determined that the allowance for credit losses was appropriate at June 30, 2020 , and that the loan portfolio is well diversified and well secured, without undue concentration in any specific risk area. While this process involves a high degree of management judgment, the allowance for credit losses is based on a comprehensive, well documented, and consistently applied analysis of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. This analysis takes into consideration all available information existing as of the financial statement date, including environmental factors such as economic, industry, geographical and political factors, when considered applicable. The relative level of allowance for credit losses is reviewed and compared to industry peers. This review encompasses levels of total non-performing loans, portfolio mix, portfolio concentrations, current geographic risks, overall levels of net charge-offs and expectations of future forecasts. Historical trending of both the Company&#8217;s results and the industry peers is also reviewed to analyze comparative significance.

The allowance for credit losses, as related to loans and lending-related commitments, is comprised of an allowance for loan losses, which is determined with respect to loans that we have originated, and an allowance for unfunded commitment losses. A separate allowance for held-to-maturity securities losses is measured related to such debt securities portfolio. Our allowance for unfunded commitment losses is determined with respect to funds that we have committed to lend but for which funds have not yet been disbursed and is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for unfunded lending-related commitments totaled $59.6 million and $1.5 million as of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019 , respectively. 

Additions to the allowance for credit losses are charged to earnings through the provision for credit losses. Charge-offs represent the amount of loans that have been determined to be uncollectible during a given period, and are deducted from the allowance for credit losses, and recoveries represent the amount of collections received from loans that had previously been charged off, and are credited to the allowance for credit losses. See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for further discussion of activity within the allowance for credit losses during the period and the relationship with respective loan balances for each loan category and the total loan portfolio. 

How We Determine the Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective or pooled basis by loans that share similar risk characteristics. If the loan no longer exhibits risk characteristics similar to that of a pool, typically due to credit deterioration of the related borrower, the Company analyzes the loan for purposes of individually assessing a specific allowance for credit loss as part of the Problem Loan Reporting system review. A separate reserve is collectively measured for loans continuing to share risk characteristics and, as a result, remaining in the pools. See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for further discussion of the allowance for credit losses measurement process. 

Collective Measurement 

The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective or pooled basis when similar risk characteristics exist, based upon the segmentation discussed above. The Company utilizes modeling methodologies that estimate lifetime credit loss rates on each pool, including methodologies estimating the probability of default and loss given default on specific segments. Historical credit loss history is adjusted for reasonable and supportable forecasts developed by the Company on a quantitative or qualitative basis. Reasonable and supportable forecasts consider the macroeconomic factors that are most relevant to evaluating and predicting expected credit losses in the Company's financial assets. Currently, the Company utilizes an eight quarter forecast period using a single macroeconomic scenario provided by a third-party and reviewed within the Company's governance structure. For periods beyond the ability to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts to historical loss rates at an input level, straight-line over a four quarter reversion period. Expected credit losses are measured over the contractual term of the financial asset with consideration of expected prepayments. Expected extensions, renewals or modifications of the financial asset are only considered when either 1) the expected extension, renewal or modification is contained within the existing agreement and is not unconditionally cancelable, or 2) the expected extension, renewal or modification is reasonably expected to result in a TDR. The methodologies discussed above are applied to both current asset balances on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Condition and off-balance sheet commitments (i.e. unfunded lending-related commitments). 

Individual Assessment 

Loans with a credit risk rating of a 6 through 9 are reviewed on a monthly basis to determine if (a) an amount is deemed uncollectible (a charge-off) or (b) it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. In cases in which collectability is not probable, the loan is considered to no longer exhibit shared risk characteristics of a pool and as a result, is individually assessed for allowance for credit losses measurement purposes. If a loan is individually assessed, the carrying amount of the loan is compared to the expected payments to be received, discounted at the loan&#8217;s original rate, or for foreclosure-probable and collateral dependent loans, to the fair value of the collateral less the estimated cost to sell, when appropriate under accounting rules. Any shortfall is recorded as a specific reserve within the allowance for credit losses. 

Home Equity, Residential Real Estate and Consumer Loans 

The determination of the appropriate allowance for loan losses for home equity, residential real estate and consumer loans differs from the process used for commercial and commercial real estate loans. These portfolios utilize the weighted-average remaining maturity ("WARM") methodology. The WARM methodology is an assumption-based approach that utilizes historical loss and prepayment information as the basis to estimate prepayment and credit adjusted contractual cash flows. The Company considers a qualitative factor to adjust historical information for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The same credit risk rating system and Problem Loan Reporting systems are used. The only significant difference is in how the credit risk ratings are assigned to these loans. 

The home equity loan portfolio is reviewed on a loan by loan basis by analyzing current FICO scores of the borrowers, line availability, recent line usage, an approaching maturity and the aging status of the loan. Certain of these factors, or combination of these factors, may cause a portion of the credit risk ratings of home equity loans across all banks to be downgraded. Similar to commercial and commercial real estate loans, once a home equity loan&#8217;s credit risk rating is downgraded to a 6 through 9, the Company&#8217;s Managed Asset Division reviews and advises the subsidiary banks as to collateral valuations and as to the ultimate resolution of the credits that deteriorate to a non-accrual status to minimize losses. 

Residential real estate loans that are downgraded to a credit risk rating of 6 through 9 also enter the problem loan reporting system and have the underlying collateral evaluated by the Managed Assets Division. 

Premium Finance Receivables 

The determination of the appropriate allowance for credit losses for premium finance receivables is an assumption-based approach focusing on historical loss rates in the portfolio, adjusted qualitatively for current macroeconomic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 

Methodology in Assessing Impairment and Charge-off Amounts 

In determining the amount of reserves or charge-offs associated with collateral dependent loans, the Company values the loan generally by starting with a valuation obtained from an appraisal of the underlying collateral and then deducting estimated selling costs, if appropriate, to arrive at a net appraised value. We obtain the appraisals of the underlying collateral typically on an annual basis from one of a pre-approved list of independent, third party appraisal firms. Types of appraisal valuations include &#8220;as-is,&#8221; &#8220;as-complete,&#8221; &#8220;as-stabilized,&#8221; bulk, fair market, liquidation and &#8220;retail sellout&#8221; values. 

In many cases, the Company simultaneously values the underlying collateral by marketing the property to market participants interested in purchasing properties of the same type. If the Company receives offers or indications of interest, we will analyze the price and review market conditions to assess whether in light of such information the appraised value overstates the likely price and that a lower price would be a better assessment of the market value of the property and would enable us to liquidate the collateral. Additionally, the Company takes into account the strength of any guarantees or other credit enhancements, and the ability of the borrower to provide value related to those guarantees in determining the ultimate charge-off or reserve associated with any individually assessed loans. Accordingly, the Company may charge-off a loan to a value below the net appraised value if it believes that an expeditious liquidation is desirable in the circumstance and it has legitimate offers or other indications of interest to support a value that is less than the net appraised value. Alternatively, the Company may carry a loan at a value that is in excess of the appraised value if the Company has a guarantee from a borrower or other credit enhancements that the Company believes has realizable value. In evaluating the strength of any guarantee, the Company evaluates the financial wherewithal of the guarantor, the guarantor&#8217;s reputation, and the guarantor&#8217;s willingness and desire to work with the Company. The Company then conducts a review of the strength of a guarantee on a frequency established as the circumstances and conditions of the borrower warrant. 

In circumstances where the Company has received an appraisal but has no third party offers or indications of interest, the Company may enlist the input of realtors in the local market as to the highest valuation that the realtor believes would result in a liquidation of the property given a reasonable marketing period of approximately 90 days. To the extent that the realtors&#8217; indication of market clearing price under such scenario is less than the net appraised valuation, the Company may take a charge-off on the loan to a valuation that is less than the net appraised valuation. 

The Company may also charge-off a loan below the net appraised valuation if the Company holds a junior mortgage position in a piece of collateral whereby the risk to acquiring control of the property through the purchase of the senior mortgage position is deemed to potentially increase the risk of loss upon liquidation due to the amount of time to ultimately market the property and the volatile market conditions. In such cases, the Company may abandon its junior mortgage and charge-off the loan balance in full. 

In other cases, the Company may allow the borrower to conduct a &#8220;short sale,&#8221; which is a sale where the Company allows the borrower to sell the property at a value less than the amount of the loan. Many times, it is possible for the current owner to receive a better price than if the property is marketed by a financial institution which the market place perceives to have a greater desire to liquidate the property at a lower price. To the extent that we allow a short sale at a price below the value indicated by an appraisal, we may take a charge-off beyond the value that an appraisal would have indicated. 

Other market conditions may require a reserve to bring the carrying value of the loan below the net appraised valuation such as litigation surrounding the borrower and/or property securing our loan or other market conditions impacting the value of the collateral. 

Having determined the net value based on the factors such as those noted above and compared that value to the book value of the loan, the Company arrives at a charge-off amount or a specific reserve included in the allowance for loan losses. In summary, for collateral dependent loans, appraisals are used as the fair value starting point in the estimate of net value. Estimated costs to sell are deducted from the appraised value, when appropriate under current accounting rules, to arrive at the net appraised value. 

Although an external appraisal is the primary source of valuation utilized for charge-offs on collateral dependent loans, alternative sources of valuation may become available between appraisal dates. As a result, we may utilize values obtained through these alternative sources, which include purchase and sale agreements, legitimate indications of interest, negotiated short sales, realtor price opinions, sale of the note or support from guarantors, as the basis for charge-offs. These alternative sources of value are used only if deemed to be more representative of value based on updated information regarding collateral resolution. In addition, if an appraisal is not deemed current, a discount to appraised value may be utilized. Any adjustments from appraised value to net value are detailed and justified in an impairment analysis, which is reviewed and approved by the Company&#8217;s Managed Assets Division. 

TDRs 

At June 30, 2020 , the Company had $83.5 million in loans modified in TDRs. The $83.5 million in TDRs represents 278 credits in which economic concessions were granted to certain borrowers to better align the terms of their loans with their current ability to pay. The balance slightly decreased from $83.6 million representing 263 credits at March 31, 2020 and increased from $76.0 million representing 182 credits at June 30, 2019 . 

Concessions were granted on a case-by-case basis working with these borrowers to find modified terms that would assist them in retaining their businesses or their homes and attempt to keep these loans in an accruing status for the Company. Typical concessions include reduction of the interest rate on the loan to a rate considered lower than market and other modification of terms including forgiveness of a portion of the loan balance, extension of the maturity date, and/or modifications from principal and interest payments to interest-only payments for a certain period. See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report for further discussion regarding the effectiveness of these modifications in keeping the modified loans current based upon contractual terms. 

Subsequent to its restructuring, any TDR that becomes nonaccrual or more than 90 days past-due and still accruing interest will be included in the Company&#8217;s non-performing loans. Each TDR was individually assessed when measuring the allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2020 and approximately $7.9 million was appropriately reserved for through the Company&#8217;s normal reserving methodology in the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses. Additionally, at June 30, 2020 , the Company was committed to lend an additional $114,000 of funds to borrowers under the contractual terms of TDRs.

Loan was previously classified as a TDR and subsequently performed in compliance with the loan's modified terms for a period of six months (including over a calendar year-end) at a modified interest rate which represented a market rate at the time of restructuring. Per our TDR policy, the TDR classification is removed. 

On March 22, 2020, interagency guidance was issued titled "Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus" that encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations due to the effect of COVID-19. Additionally, Section 4013 of the CARES Act further provides that a qualified loan modification is exempt by law from classification as a TDR as defined by GAAP, from the period beginning March 1, 2020 until the earlier of December 31, 2020 or the date that is 60 days after the date on which the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak declared by the President of the United States under the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C 1601 et seq.) terminates. Accordingly, we are offering short-term 

modifications made in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who are current and otherwise not past due. These include short-term, 180 days or less, modifications in the form of payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are generally insignificant. Modifications qualifying for the exemption from TDR classification totaled approximately $1.7 billion as of June 30, 2020. 

The table below presents a summary of all COVID-19 related modified loans as of June 30, 2020, presented by loan category and type of modification:

Total average deposits for the second quarter of 2020 were $34.5 billion , an increase of $8.4 billion , or 32% , from the second quarter of 2019 . The increase in average deposits is primarily attributable to the various acquisitions and branch openings along with additional deposits related to PPP lending and organic growth of retail deposits. 

Wealth management deposits are funds from the brokerage customers of Wintrust Investments, CDEC, trust and asset management customers of the Company and brokerage customers from unaffiliated companies which have been placed into deposit accounts of the banks (&#8220;wealth management deposits&#8221; in the table above). Wealth Management deposits consist primarily of money market accounts. Consistent with reasonable interest rate risk parameters, these funds have generally been invested in loan production of the banks as well as other investments suitable for banks. 

Brokered Deposits 

While the Company obtains a portion of its total deposits through brokered deposits, the Company does so primarily as an asset-liability management tool to assist in the management of interest rate risk, and the Company does not consider brokered deposits to be a vital component of its current liquidity resources. Historically, brokered deposits have represented a small component of the Company&#8217;s total deposits outstanding, as set forth in the table below:

Brokered deposits include certificates of deposit obtained through deposit brokers, deposits received through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Program (&#8220;CDARS&#8221;), and wealth management deposits of brokerage customers from unaffiliated companies which have been placed into deposit accounts of the banks. 

Other Funding Sources 

Although deposits are the Company&#8217;s primary source of funding its interest-earning assets, the Company&#8217;s ability to manage the types and terms of deposits is somewhat limited by customer preferences and market competition. As a result, in addition to deposits and the issuance of equity securities and the retention of earnings, the Company uses several other funding sources to support its growth. These sources include short-term borrowings, notes payable, FHLB advances, subordinated debt, secured borrowings and junior subordinated debentures. The Company evaluates the terms and unique characteristics of each source, as well as its asset-liability management position, in determining the use of such funding sources. 

The following table sets forth, by category, the composition of the average balances of other funding sources for the quarterly periods presented:

FHLB advances provide the banks with access to fixed rate funds that are useful in mitigating interest rate risk and achieving an acceptable interest rate spread on fixed rate loans or securities. Additionally, the banks have the ability to borrow shorter-term, overnight funding from the FHLB for other general purposes. FHLB advances to the banks totaled $1.2 billion at June 30, 2020 , compared to $1.2 billion at March 31, 2020 and $574.8 million at June 30, 2019 . 

Notes payable balances as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 represent the balances on our $200.0 million loan agreement with unaffiliated banks consisting of a $50.0 million revolving credit facility and a $150.0 million term facility. Both loan facilities are available for corporate purposes such as to provide capital to fund continued growth at existing bank subsidiaries, possible future acquisitions and for other general corporate matters. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had a balance under the term facility of $112.4 million and $123.1 million, respectively. The Company was contractually required to borrow the entire amount of the term facility on September 18, 2018 and all such borrowings must be repaid by September 18, 2023. At June 30, 2020, the Company had no outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility. 

Short-term borrowings include securities sold under repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased. These borrowings totaled $8.5 million at June 30, 2020 compared to $12.1 million at March 31, 2020 and $10.2 million at June 30, 2019 . Securities sold under repurchase agreements represent sweep accounts for certain customers in connection with master repurchase agreements at the banks. This funding category typically fluctuates based on customer preferences and daily liquidity needs of the banks, their customers and the banks&#8217; operating subsidiaries. 

The average balance of secured borrowings primarily represents a third party Canadian transaction ("Canadian Secured Borrowing"). Under the Canadian Secured Borrowing, in December 2014, the Company, through its subsidiary, FIFC Canada, sold an undivided co-ownership interest in all receivables owed to FIFC Canada to an unrelated third party in exchange for a cash payment of approximately C$150 million pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement (&#8220;Receivables Purchase Agreement&#8221;). The Receivables Purchase Agreement was amended in December 2015, effectively extending the maturity date from December 15, 2015 to December 15, 2017. Additionally, at that time, the unrelated third party paid an additional C$10 million , which increased the total payments to C$160 million . The Receivables Purchase Agreement was again amended in December 2017, effectively extending the maturity date from December 15, 2017 to December 16, 2019. Additionally, in December 2017, the unrelated third party paid an additional C$10 million , which increased the total payments to C$170 million . In June 2018, the unrelated third party paid an additional C$20 million , which increased the total payments to C$190 million . The Receivables Purchase Agreement was again amended in February 2019, effectively extending the maturity date from December 16, 2019 to December 15, 2020. Additionally, in February 2019, the unrelated third party paid an additional C$20 million , which increased the total payments to C$210 million. In May 2019, the unrelated third party paid an additional C$70 million , which increased the total payments to C$280 million . In January 2020, the unrelated third party paid an additional C$40 million , which increased the total payments to C$320 million , and the Receivables Purchase Agreement was amended to effectively extend the maturity date from December 15, 2020 to December 15, 2021. In May 2020, the unrelated third party paid an additional C$100 million, which increased the total payments to C$420 million. These transactions were not considered sales of receivables and, as such, related proceeds received are reflected on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition as a secured borrowing owed to the unrelated third party and translated to the Company&#8217;s reporting currency as of the respective date. The translated balance of the Canadian Secured Borrowing under the Receivables Purchase Agreement totaled $309.1 million at June 30, 2020 compared to $227.4 million at March 31, 2020 and $213.7 million at June 30, 2019 . At June 30, 2020 , the interest rate of the Canadian Secured Borrowing was 1.7771% . The remaining balance within secured borrowings at June 30, 2020 represents other sold interests in certain loans by the Company that were not considered sales and, as such, related proceeds received are reflected on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition as a secured borrowing owed to the various unrelated third parties. 

Other borrowings at June 30, 2020 include a fixed-rate promissory note issued by the Company in June 2017 ("Fixed-Rate Promissory Note") related to and secured by three office buildings owned by the Company. At June 30, 2020 , the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note had a balance of $66.0 million compared to $66.3 million at March 31, 2020 and $47.1 million at June 30, 2019 . Under the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note, the Company makes monthly principal payments and pays interest at a fixed rate until maturity. An amendment to the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note was executed on and effective as of March 31, 2020. The amendment increased the principal amount to $66.4 million, reduced the interest rate to 3.00% and extended the maturity date to March 31, 2025. 

At June 30, 2020 , the Company had outstanding subordinated notes totaling $436.3 million compared to $436.2 million and $436.0 million outstanding at March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019 , respectively. During the second quarter of 2019, the Company issued $300.0 million of subordinated notes, receiving $296.7 million in net proceeds. The notes have a stated interest rate of 4.85% and mature in June 2029. In 2014, the Company issued $140.0 million of subordinated notes receiving $139.1 million in net proceeds. These notes have a stated interest rate of 5.00% and mature in June 2024 . Subordinated notes are stated at par adjusted for unamortized costs paid related to the different issuances of such debt. 

The Company had $253.6 million of junior subordinated debentures outstanding as of June 30, 2020 , March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019 . The amounts reflected on the balance sheet represent the junior subordinated debentures issued to 11 trusts by the Company and equal the amount of the preferred and common securities issued by the trusts. At June 30, 2020 , the Company included $245.5 million of the junior subordinated debentures, net of common securities, in Tier 2 regulatory capital. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company will continue to manage funding sources discussed above, including the utilization of availability with the FHLB and FRB and the Revolving Credit Facility with unaffiliated banks, to access needed liquidity in a timely manner. Please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Overview and - Liquidity sections of this report for additional discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

See Notes 11 and 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for details of period end balances and other information for these various funding sources.

In February 2019, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC issued a final rule to address the changes to the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, including banking organizations&#8217; implementation of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard as of its date of adoption, or January 1, 2020. In March 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC published an interim final rule to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The interim final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). The Company is adopting the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period. 

The Company&#8217;s principal sources of funds at the holding company level are dividends from its subsidiaries, borrowings under its loan agreement with unaffiliated banks and proceeds from the issuances of subordinated debt and additional equity. Refer to Notes 11, 12 and 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 for further information on these various funding sources. Management is committed to maintaining the Company&#8217;s capital levels above the &#8220;Well Capitalized&#8221; levels established by the FRB for bank holding companies. 

The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approves dividends from time to time, however, the ability to declare a dividend is limited by the Company's financial condition, the terms of the Company's Series D and Series E preferred stock, the terms of the Company&#8217;s Trust Preferred Securities offerings and under certain financial covenants in the Company&#8217;s revolving and term facilities. In January and April of 2020 the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.28 per common share. In January, April, July and October of 2019, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company continues to leverage its capital management framework to assess and monitor risk when making capital decisions. The Company will continuously evaluate the adequacy of capital as a result of the uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic. Please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Overview section of this report for additional discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

See Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for details on the Company&#8217;s issuance of Series D preferred stock in June 2015 and Series E Preferred Stock and associated Depositary Shares in May 2020. The Company hereby incorporates by reference Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report in its entirety. 

LIQUIDITY 

The Company manages the liquidity position of its banking operations to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet customers&#8217; needs for loans and deposit withdrawals. The management process includes the utilization of stress testing processes and other aspects of the Company's liquidity management framework to assess and monitor risk, and inform decision making. The liquidity to meet the demands of customers is provided by maturing assets, liquid assets that can be converted to cash and the ability to attract funds from external sources. Liquid assets refer to money market assets such as Federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks, as well as available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are not pledged to secure public funds. In addition, trade date receivables represent certain sales or calls of available-for-sale securities that await cash settlement, typically in the month following the trade date. 

In accordance with the liquidity management noted above, deposit growth and increases in borrowings from various sources have resulted in accumulating liquidity assets in recent periods. In the first quarter of 2020, we increased our liquid assets to ensure that we have the balance sheet strength to serve our clients through the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the Company believes that it has sufficient funds and access to funds to effectively manage through the COVID-19 pandemic as well as meet its working capital and other needs. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate and expand liquidity sources, including the management of availability with the FHLB and FRB and utilization of the revolving credit facility with unaffiliated banks. Please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Interest-Earning Assets, -Deposits, -Other Funding Sources and -Shareholders&#8217; Equity sections of this report for additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s liquidity position. Please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Overview section of this report for additional discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

INFLATION 

A banking organization&#8217;s assets and liabilities are primarily monetary. Changes in the rate of inflation do not have as great an impact on the financial condition of a bank as do changes in interest rates. Moreover, interest rates do not necessarily change at the same percentage as inflation. Accordingly, changes in inflation are not expected to have a material impact on the Company. An analysis of the Company&#8217;s asset and liability structure provides the best indication of how the organization is positioned to respond to changing interest rates. See &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; section of this report for additional information.
