 Item 2.&#8194;&#8194;&#8197; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . 

Results of Operations 

Overview 

Organization 

The Company primarily generates revenues and cash by financing John Deere dealers&#8217; sales and leases of new and used production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the Company also provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment and finances retail revolving charge accounts. 

Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions 

John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial operating model is focused on making significant investments in strengthening its capabilities in digital, automation, autonomy, and alternative propulsion technologies. These technologies are intended to increase worksite efficiency, improve yields, lower input costs, and ease labor constraints. John Deere&#8217;s Leap Ambitions are goals designed to boost economic value and sustainability for John Deere&#8217;s customers. As an enabling business, the Company is fully integrated with John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial operating model and is focused on providing financial solutions to help John Deere achieve its Leap Ambitions. John Deere and the Company anticipate opportunities in this area, as John Deere, the Company, and their customers have a vested interest in sustainable practices.

Trends and Economic Conditions 

The Company&#8217;s volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products. The level of John Deere retail sales and leases is responsive to a variety of economic, financial, climatic, legislative, and other factors that influence supply and demand for its products.

Industry Trends for Fiscal Year 2023 

Industry sales of large agricultural machinery in the U.S. and Canada for 2023 are forecasted to increase approximately 10 percent compared to 2022. Industry sales of small agricultural and turf equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be down about 5 percent in 2023. Industry sales of agricultural machinery in Europe are forecasted to be flat to up 5 percent, while South American industry sales of tractors and combines are expected to be flat in 2023. Asia industry sales are forecasted to be down moderately in 2023. On an industry basis, the U.S. and Canada construction equipment and compact construction equipment sales are both expected to be flat to up 5 percent in 2023. Global forestry and global roadbuilding industry sales are each expected to be flat.

John Deere Trends 

Customers&#8217; demand for integration of technology into equipment is a market trend underlying John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial operating model and Leap Ambitions framework. Customers have sought to improve profitability, productivity, and sustainability through technology. John Deere&#8217;s approach to technology involves hardware and software; guidance, connectivity and digital solutions; automation and machine intelligence; machine autonomy; and alternative propulsion technologies. This technology is incorporated into products within each of John Deere&#8217;s operating segments. Customers continue to adopt technology integrated in the John Deere portfolio of &#8220;smart&#8221; machines, systems, and solutions. The Company expects this trend to persist for the foreseeable future. 

Demand for John Deere&#8217;s equipment remains strong, as order books are full throughout 2023. Agricultural fundamentals are expected to remain solid through 2023, and retail demand will comprise most of 2023 sales. The North American retail customer fleet age of combines and large tractors is historically high, and dealer inventories are low due to the manufacturing and supply chain constraints over the past few years. John Deere expects elevated demand to continue for the second half of the year as evidenced by retail customer orders that extend into 2024. Crop prices remain favorable to John Deere customers in part due to a stock-to-use ratio below 

&#8203; 

the 10-year average for key grains. John Deere expects sales volume of large agricultural equipment to be greater in 2023 than 2022 in North America and Europe. Sales volume for small agriculture and turf equipment is expected to be lower than 2022 due to lower demand for consumer-oriented products, partially offset by stronger demand for mid-sized equipment. Construction equipment markets are forecasted to be steady. Strong U.S. infrastructure spending, industrial construction, and rental inventory restocking are expected to more than offset moderation in residential home and commercial real estate construction. Importantly, construction equipment dealer inventory remains below historical averages. Roadbuilding demand remains strongest in the U.S., largely offset by softening demand in Europe and parts of Asia. 

Supply chain conditions have improved over 2022; however, John Deere continues to experience disruptions above historical norms. Supply chain disruptions impacted many aspects of John Deere&#8217;s business starting in 2022, including parts availability, increased production costs, and higher inventory levels. Past due deliveries from suppliers were at elevated levels during 2022. John Deere implemented mitigation efforts to minimize the impact of supply chain disruptions on its ability to meet customer demand. John Deere has experienced supply chain improvements in the second quarter of 2023. The reduction in supply chain disruptions contributed to higher levels of production in the second quarter of 2023. However, remaining constraints in the supply base will limit higher levels of production in the second half of the year. As a result, the production schedules in 2023 will be more aligned with the customers&#8217; seasonal use of John Deere&#8217;s products, marking a return to historical seasonal production patterns. 

Company Trends 

Net income for the Company in fiscal year 2023 is expected to be lower than fiscal year 2022 primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, lower gains on operating lease dispositions, a higher provision for credit losses, and higher selling, administrative, and general expenses. These factors are expected to be partially offset by income earned on higher average portfolio balances, driven by strong demand of John Deere&#8217;s products throughout 2023, which is favorably impacting financing volumes.

Central bank policy interest rates increased in the first six months of 2023. Most of the Company&#8217;s Customer Receivables are fixed rate, while its wholesale receivables generally are variable rate. The Company has both fixed and variable rate borrowings. The Company manages the risk of interest rate fluctuations by balancing the types and amounts of its funding sources to its Receivable and Lease portfolios. Accordingly, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate exposure. Historically, rising interest rates impact the Company&#8217;s borrowings sooner than the benefit is realized from the Receivable and Lease portfolio. As a result, the Company&#8217;s financing spread was unfavorably impacted by $85.7 million (after-tax) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The Company expects spread compression to persist during 2023.

Recent banking sector events have resulted in increased liquidity considerations. The Company&#8217;s deposits are well diversified, and as a result, the Company was not exposed to banks that have entered receivership or encountered liquidity issues. These events have not changed the Company&#8217;s access to capital markets. The Company continues to monitor counterparty exposure through regular reviews of various risk metrics and by adjusting exposure limits as needed.

As the Company&#8217;s volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products, supply chain disruptions could impact the Company&#8217;s future volumes. Despite supply chain challenges, the Company&#8217;s volumes have grown and further growth is forecast in 2023, driven by strong demand for John Deere equipment. 

Supply chain disruptions, rising interest rates, and recent banking sector events are driven by factors outside of the Company&#8217;s control, and as a result, the Company cannot reasonably foresee when these conditions will subside.

Other Items of Concern and Uncertainties 

Other items of concern include global and regional political conditions, failure to raise the U.S. debt ceiling, economic and trade policies, imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, post-pandemic effects, capital market disruptions, changes in demand and pricing for new and used 

&#8203; 

equipment, significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and volatility in the prices of many commodities. These items could impact the Company&#8217;s results. John Deere and the Company are making investments in technology and in strengthening capabilities in digital, automation, autonomy, and alternative propulsion technologies. As with most technology investments, marketplace adoption, monetization, and regulation of these features holds an elevated level of uncertainty.

Financing Incentives 

In the second quarter of 2023, the Company corrected the accounting treatment for financing incentives offered to John Deere dealers. Refer to Note 1, Note 2, and Note 12 of the interim consolidated financial statements for additional information. While prior period amounts have been restated for comparability, the impact of the correction in periods prior to the second quarter ended April 30, 2023 is not material to the consolidated financial statements of the Company in any of the impacted periods.

Total revenues increased for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 primarily due to a 19% and 17% increase in average portfolio balances, respectively, in addition to higher average financing rates compared to the same periods last year. Net income for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 was lower compared to the same periods in 2022 primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, lower gains on operating lease dispositions, and a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by income earned on higher average portfolio balances.

Finance income earned on retail notes, revolving charge accounts, and wholesale receivables increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, due to higher average financing rates and higher average portfolio balances. Lease revenues were about the same for each period.

Other income increased slightly in the second quarter and was about the same for the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher interest earned on the Company&#8217;s cash and cash equivalents, offset by lower gains on operating lease dispositions. While demand for used equipment remains strong, lease gains declined during 2023 as end-of-lease book values are now more closely aligned with equipment sale proceeds.

Revenues earned from John Deere totaled $251.2 million for the second quarter and $459.4 million for the first six months of 2023, compared with $149.7 million and $288.3 million for the same periods last year. The increase was primarily due to increased compensation paid by John Deere on wholesale receivables and retail notes, driven by a higher interest rate environment, in addition to higher average portfolio balances. Revenues earned from John Deere are included in each of the revenue amounts discussed above.

The increase in interest expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 was primarily due to higher average borrowing rates and higher average borrowings. 

Depreciation of equipment on operating leases decreased slightly for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower average balances of equipment on operating leases.

Administrative and operating expenses increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher dealer financing incentive program costs driven by increased finance volumes, in addition to higher employment costs, including incentive compensation.

Fees and interest paid to John Deere decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 primarily due to a one-time payment to Deere &#38; Company in 2022 that did not recur in 2023, related to unrealized gains on certain non-designated derivatives assumed by Deere &#38; Company. This was partially offset by higher interest on intercompany borrowings from John Deere, driven by higher average borrowing rates.

The provision for credit losses increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared with the same periods last year primarily due to favorable allowance adjustments on agricultural retail notes and finance leases in 2022, which did not recur in the current year, in addition to higher net write-offs on revolving charge accounts in 2023. The annualized provision for credit losses, as a percentage of the average balance of total Receivables, was .24 percent for the second quarter and .14 percent for the first six months of 2023, compared with .14 percent and .07 percent for the same periods last year, respectively.

The provision for income taxes decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2023 primarily due to lower pretax income.

Customer Receivables increased $166.0 million during the first six months of 2023 due to strong John Deere retail sales, partially offset by a seasonal decrease in revolving charge account receivables. Customer Receivables increased $3,638.3 million compared to one year ago due to strong John Deere retail sales. Wholesale receivables increased $4,475.9 million in the first six months of 2023 and $5,534.0 million compared to one year ago due to higher shipment volumes of John Deere equipment.

Total Receivables 30 days or more past due, non-performing Receivables, and the allowance for credit losses were as follows (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of the Receivables balance):

Receivables 30 days or more past due continue to accrue finance income. The Company ceases to accrue finance income once Receivables are considered non-performing. An allowance for credit losses is recorded for the estimated credit losses expected over the life of the Receivable portfolio. The Company measures expected credit losses on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Risk characteristics considered by the Company include product category, market, geography, credit risk, and remaining duration. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics with other receivables in the portfolio are evaluated on an individual basis. Non-performing Receivables are included in the estimate of expected credit losses. While the Company believes its allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of its existing Receivable portfolio, different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses. See Note 4 for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses.

&#8203; 

Deposits held from dealers and merchants amounted to $131.7 million at April 30, 2023, compared with $137.3 million at October 30, 2022 and $126.9 million at May 1, 2022. These balances primarily represent the aggregate dealer retail note and lease withholding accounts from individual John Deere dealers to which losses from retail notes and leases originating from the respective dealers can be charged. Recoveries from dealer deposits are recognized in other income when the dealer&#8217;s withholding account is charged. Recoveries from dealer deposits and other freestanding credit enhancements recorded in other income were $3.9 million in the second quarter and $5.8 million for the first six months of 2023, compared with $1.9 million and $3.1 million for the same periods last year, respectively.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

See the Company&#8217;s critical accounting estimates discussed in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company&#8217;s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to these estimates. 

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

For additional information on the Company&#8217;s dependence on, and relationship with, Deere &#38; Company, see the Company&#8217;s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Sources of Liquidity, Key Metrics and Balance Sheet Data 

The Company relies on its ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance its Receivable and Lease portfolios. The Company has access to most global capital markets at a reasonable cost. The Company&#8217;s ability to meet its debt obligations is supported in several ways. The assets of the Company are self-liquidating in nature. A solid equity position is available to absorb unusual losses on these assets, and all commercial paper is backed by unsecured, committed borrowing lines from various banks. Liquidity is also provided by the Company&#8217;s ability to securitize its retail notes and through the issuance of term debt in both public and private markets. Additionally, liquidity may be provided through loans from John Deere. The Company closely monitors its liquidity sources against the cash requirements and expects to have sufficient sources of global funding and liquidity to meet its funding needs in the short-term (next 12 months) and long-term (beyond 12 months).

Key metrics and certain balance sheet data are provided in the following table, in millions of dollars:

The reduction in unused credit lines in 2023 compared to both prior periods relates to an increase in commercial paper outstanding, by both the Company and John Deere, due to changes in Receivables and funding mix.

There have been no material changes to the contractual and other cash requirements identified in the Company&#8217;s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Net cash was used for investing activities during the first six months of 2023 primarily due to growth in the wholesale and retail note portfolios. Net cash used by investing activities was funded primarily through external borrowings, capital investments from John Deere, and cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by a reduction in borrowings from John Deere.

&#8203; 

Borrowings 

Total borrowings increased $4,803.3 million in the first six months of 2023 and increased $9,105.6 million compared to a year ago, generally corresponding with the level of the Receivable and Lease portfolios. During the first six months of 2023, the Company issued $4,298.0 million and retired $3,121.4 million of long-term external borrowings, which primarily consisted of medium-term notes. During the first six months of 2023, the Company also issued $1,289.1 million and retired $1,622.4 million of retail note securitization borrowings and maintained an average commercial paper balance of $3,886.4 million. The Company&#8217;s funding profile may be altered to reflect such factors as relative costs of funding sources, assets available for securitizations, and capital market accessibility.

The Company has a revolving warehouse facility to utilize bank conduit facilities to securitize retail notes (see Note 5). The facility was renewed in November 2022 with an expiration in November 2023 and increased the total capacity or &#8220;financing limit&#8221; from $1,000.0 million to $1,500.0 million. At April 30, 2023, $948.1 million of securitization borrowings were outstanding under the facility. At the end of the contractual revolving period, unless the banks and the Company agree to renew, the Company would liquidate the secured borrowings over time as payments on the retail notes are collected.

Capital Investments and Dividends 

In the first six months of 2023, Deere &#38; Company increased its capital investment in JDFS by $810.0 million. JDFS, in turn, increased its capital investment in Capital Corporation by the same amount. The capital investments were made to maintain consistent leverage ratios driven by growth in total Receivables and corresponding borrowings. There were no capital investments during the first six months of 2022.

Capital Corporation did not declare or pay a dividend in the first six months of 2023. In the first six months of 2022, Capital Corporation declared and paid cash dividends to JDFS of $175.0 million. JDFS paid comparable dividends to Deere &#38; Company.

Lines of Credit 

The Company has access to bank lines of credit with various banks throughout the world. Some of the lines are available to both the Company and Deere &#38; Company. Worldwide lines of credit totaled $10,082.7 million at April 30, 2023, $785.3 million of which were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings of the Company and John Deere, excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term external borrowings, were considered to constitute utilization. Included in the total credit lines at April 30, 2023 was a 364-day credit facility agreement of $5,000.0 million, expiring in the second quarter of 2024. In addition, total credit lines included long-term credit facility agreements of $2,500.0 million, expiring in the second quarter of 2027, and $2,500.0 million, expiring in the second quarter of 2028. These credit agreements require the Company to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for any four consecutive fiscal quarterly periods and its ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholder&#8217;s equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. All of the requirements in the credit agreements have been met during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.

Debt Ratings 

The Company&#8217;s ability to obtain funding is affected by its debt ratings, which are closely related to the outlook for and the financial condition of John Deere, and the nature and availability of support facilities, such as the Company&#8217;s lines of credit and the support agreement from Deere &#38; Company.

&#8203; 

To access public debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to the Company&#8217;s debt securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A security rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell, or hold the Company&#8217;s securities. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw ratings based on its assessment of the Company&#8217;s current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agency&#8217;s rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, and reduced access to debt capital markets. 

The senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to unsecured Company debt securities by the rating agencies engaged by the Company are the same as those for John Deere. Those ratings are as follows:
