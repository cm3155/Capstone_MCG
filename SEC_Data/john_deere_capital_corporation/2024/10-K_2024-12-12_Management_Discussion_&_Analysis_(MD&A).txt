 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

The MD&#38;A is intended to promote understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For comparison of 2023 to 2022 results, refer to the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis&#8221; section of our 2023 Form 10-K.

Results of Operations 

All amounts are presented in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.

Overview 

Organization 

We provide financial solutions that enable John Deere customers and dealers to advance their lives and livelihoods. Through our offering of retail notes, leases, and revolving charge accounts, customers are able to finance new and used John Deere equipment, as well as parts, services, and other input costs needed to run their operations. We also provide wholesale financing to John Deere dealers.

Trends and Economic Conditions 

Our volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products. The level of John Deere retail sales and leases is responsive to a variety of economic, financial, climatic, legislative, and other factors that influence supply and demand for its products. 

Industry Sales Outlook for Fiscal Year 2025 

John Deere Trends 

Customers seek to improve profitability, productivity, and sustainability through integrating technology into their operations. Deeper integration of technology into equipment is a persistent market trend. The technologies that are the focus of John Deere's operating model are incorporated into products within each of John Deere's operating segments. John Deere expects this trend to persist for the foreseeable future. John Deere's Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions are intended to capitalize on this market trend.

Agriculture and Turf Outlook for 2025 

##TABLE_START &#9679; John Deere&#8217;s agriculture and turf equipment sales are projected to decline in 2025 due to contraction of agriculture markets globally. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Demand in the U.S. and Canada is expected to further moderate amidst weak farm fundamentals, high interest rates, elevated used inventory levels, and short-term farmer liquidity concerns heading into the 2025 growing season. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; John Deere expects small agricultural equipment sales to be down from 2024 levels in the U.S. and Canada. The dairy and livestock segment is anticipated to have another year of strong profitability as elevated livestock and hay prices are further enhanced by low input feed costs. This is projected to be more than offset by restrained demand in the turf and compact utility tractor markets as single family home sales and home improvement spending remain stagnant amid high interest rates. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; In Europe, the industry is forecasted to be down as farm fundamentals in the region continue to deteriorate, but at a moderated pace relative to 2024. Adverse factors include depressed yields from unfavorable weather, reduced regional commodity prices due to a mixture of excess grain inflows from Ukraine and global pricing pressures, persistently elevated input costs, and unfavorable agriculture legislation. These issues coupled with high interest rates and elevated industry inventory levels are expected to keep industry equipment demand at low levels throughout 2025. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Argentina industry sales are forecasted to improve as the currency stabilizes amid agricultural industry recovery. ##TABLE_END 

Construction and Forestry Outlook for 2025 

##TABLE_START &#9679; John Deere&#8217;s construction equipment sales are projected to decline in 2025 as healthy end markets are offset by continued uncertainty in equipment purchases, while roadbuilding equipment sales are anticipated to be generally flat. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Construction equipment industry sales are forecasted to be down in the U.S. and Canada from 2024 levels. The decline is due to projected modest growth in single family housing starts and U.S. government infrastructure spending, which is expected to be more than offset by further slowdowns in multi-family housing developments, non-residential buildings, and reduced spending in oil and gas. Historically low levels of earthmoving rental purchases and rising used inventories are expected to further pressure equipment sales as market uncertainty persists. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Global forestry markets are expected to be flat to down as challenged global markets stabilize at low demand levels . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Global roadbuilding markets are forecasted to be generally flat, as a modest recovery in Europe is expected to compensate for a slight slowdown in other geographies. ##TABLE_END 

Company Trends 

Our net income for fiscal year 2025 is expected to be higher than fiscal year 2024 primarily due to a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by less favorable financing spreads.

Interest Rates. While interest rates in the U.S. began to decrease in the fourth quarter of 2024, they remained elevated. Most of our receivables and leases with retail customers are fixed rate, while our wholesale receivables generally are variable rate. Our Receivable and Lease portfolio is financed with fixed and variable rate borrowings. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by matching the interest rate characteristics of our portfolio with our funding sources. We also enter into interest rate swap agreements to match our interest rate exposure.

Rising interest rates have historically impacted our borrowing costs sooner than the benefit is realized from our Receivable and Lease portfolio. As a result, we continued to experience financing spread compression in 2024, but at a moderating pace relative to spread compression experienced in 2023. 

Agricultural Market Business Cycle . The agricultural market is affected by various factors including commodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields, and government policies. These factors affect farmers&#8217; income and may result in varying demand for John Deere&#8217;s equipment and higher credit losses. In 2024, we experienced unfavorable market conditions which resulted in higher receivable write-offs and an increase in expected credit losses.

Changes in interest rates and the agricultural market business cycle are driven by factors outside of our control, and as a result we cannot reasonably foresee when these conditions will fully subside.

##TABLE_END

Total revenues increased in 2024 primarily due to a 15 percent increase in average Receivable portfolio balances and higher average financing rates on Receivables of 7.0 percent in 2024 compared to 6.3 percent in 2023. Net income in 2024 was higher than 2023 due to income earned on higher average portfolio balances and lower dealer financing incentives, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and less favorable financing spreads driven primarily by portfolio mix. 2024 results also benefited from higher recoveries on freestanding credit enhancements.

##TABLE_END Higher average portfolio balances and higher average finance rates drove increased revenues across all products during 2024. 

Other income increased in 2024 primarily due to higher credit enhancement recoveries and higher interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and intercompany receivables from John Deere, partially offset by lower gains on operating lease dispositions.

Revenues earned from John Deere totaled $1,119.6 in 2024, compared with $1,027.9 in 2023. The increase was primarily the result of higher subsidies earned from John Deere on retail notes and revolving charge accounts, driven by an elevated interest rate environment and higher average portfolio balances. Higher interest received from John Deere on intercompany receivables also contributed to the increase.

##TABLE_END The increase in interest expense in 2024 was primarily due to higher average borrowings to fund a larger portfolio and higher average borrowing rates.

Administrative and operating expenses decreased during 2024 due to lower dealer financing incentive program costs and lower foreign exchange losses.

Fees and interest paid to John Deere decreased in 2024 primarily due to lower interest on intercompany borrowings from John Deere, driven by lower average borrowings.

The provision for credit losses increased in 2024 compared to 2023 due to higher net write-offs on retail notes and revolving charge accounts and an increase in the allowance, driven primarily by higher expected losses on retail notes as a result of elevated delinquencies and a decline in market conditions. The provision for credit losses, as a percentage of the average balance of total Receivables, was .57 percent for 2024 and .19 percent for 2023. 

The lower provision for income taxes in 2024 was primarily due to favorable discrete tax items.

##TABLE_END We monitor the credit quality of Receivables based on delinquency status. Receivables 30 days or more past due continue to accrue finance income. We stop accruing finance income once Receivables are considered non-performing, which generally occurs once Receivables are 90 days past due. An allowance for credit losses is recorded for the estimated credit losses expected over the life of the Receivable portfolio.

Deposits held from dealers and merchants amounted to $129.6 at October 27, 2024, compared with $138.4 at October 29, 2023. These balances primarily represent the aggregate dealer retail note and lease deposits from individual John Deere dealers to which losses from retail notes and leases originating from the respective dealers can be charged. Recoveries from dealer deposits are recognized in &#8220;Other income&#8221; when the dealer&#8217;s withholding account is charged.

We also utilize other freestanding credit enhancements, such as credit insurance and bank guarantees, to mitigate credit risk. Recoveries from these freestanding credit enhancements are generally recognized when the associated credit loss is recorded. Recoveries from dealer deposits and other freestanding credit enhancements recorded in &#8220;Other income&#8221; were $54.0 and $17.0 in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in 2024 was driven by higher recoveries from John Deere dealers and expected recoveries on bank guarantee contracts. See Note 4 for additional information.

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

Sources of Liquidity, Key Metrics, and Balance Sheet Data 

We rely on our ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance our Receivable and Lease portfolios. We have access to global markets at a reasonable cost and our ability to meet our debt obligations is supported in several ways. Sources of liquidity include: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; cash and cash equivalents, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the issuance of commercial paper and term debt, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the securitization of retail notes, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; intercompany loans from John Deere, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; our Receivable and Lease portfolio, which is self-liquidating in nature, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; bank lines of credit. ##TABLE_END 

We closely monitor our cash requirements. Based on the available sources of liquidity, we expect to meet our funding needs in the short term (next 12 months) and long term (beyond 12 months).

Net cash was used for investing activities during 2024 primarily due to growth in the Receivable and Lease portfolios, which was funded primarily through external borrowings and cash provided by operating activities.

&#8203; 

Borrowings 

Total borrowings increased $3,630.5 in 2024, generally corresponding with the level of the Receivable and Lease portfolios. During 2024, we issued $13,214.2 and retired $6,062.7 of long-term external borrowings, which primarily consisted of medium-term notes. During 2024, we also issued $5,285.4 and retired $3,849.4 of retail note securitization borrowings and maintained an average commercial paper balance of $4,976.9. Our funding profile may be altered to reflect such factors as relative costs of funding sources, assets available for securitizations, and capital market accessibility.

We have a revolving credit agreement to securitize retail notes (see Note 5). At October 27, 2024, the revolving credit agreement had a total capacity, or &#8220;financing limit,&#8221; of $2,000.0 of secured financings at any time. $1,398.3 of short-term securitization borrowings were outstanding under the agreement at October 27, 2024. At the end of the contractual revolving period, unless we and the banks agree to renew, we would liquidate the secured borrowings over time as payments on the retail notes are collected. The agreement was renewed in November 2024 with an expiration in November 2025 and a capacity of $2,500.0.

Capital Investments and Dividends 

During 2023, Deere &#38; Company increased its capital investment in JDFS by $810.0. JDFS, in turn, increased its capital investment in Capital Corporation by the same amount. The capital investments were made to maintain targeted leverage ratios and were driven by growth in total Receivables and corresponding borrowings. There were no significant capital investments during 2024. 

Capital Corporation declared and paid cash dividends to JDFS of $215.0 in 2024 and $165.0 in 2023. In turn, JDFS paid comparable dividends to Deere &#38; Company.

Lines of Credit 

We have access to bank lines of credit with various banks throughout the world. Some of the lines are available to both us and Deere &#38; Company. Worldwide lines of credit totaled $10,678.2 at October 27, 2024, $6,474.0 of which were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings of us and John Deere were considered to constitute utilization. See Note 8 for more information.

Debt Ratings 

Our ability to obtain funding is affected by our debt ratings, which are closely related to the outlook for and the financial condition of John Deere, and the nature and availability of support facilities, such as our lines of credit and the support agreement from Deere &#38; Company.

To access public debt capital markets, we rely on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to our debt securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A security rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell, or hold our debt securities. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw ratings based on its assessment of our current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agency&#8217;s rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, reduced access to debt capital markets, and may adversely impact our liquidity.

The senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to our unsecured debt securities by the rating agencies engaged by us are the same as those for John Deere and are as follows:

##TABLE_END Contractual Obligations and Cash Requirements 

Our material cash requirements from contractual and other cash obligations relate to borrowings, including securitization borrowings. As of October 27, 2024, we had $16,025.7 of principal payments on borrowings and securitization borrowings payable in the next 12 months, along with interest payments of $2,057.0. The securitization borrowing payments are based on the expected liquidation of the related retail notes securitized. These payments will likely be replaced with new borrowings to finance the Receivables and Leases portfolio, which is expected to be lower in 2025. See Notes 5, 7, and 9 for further detail regarding future contractual payments on securitization borrowings, intercompany borrowings, and long-term external borrowings.

We also have commitments to extend credit to customers and John Deere dealers through lines of credit and other pre-approved credit arrangements. A significant portion of these commitments is not expected to be fully drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts likely do not represent a future cash requirement. There were $11,733.5 of commitments to John Deere dealers and $32,901.7 of commitments to customers primarily related to revolving charge accounts at October 27, 2024. See Note 17 for further detail regarding these commitments.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The timely preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Those estimates affect reported amounts in these financial statements. Changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements. The following estimates are the most critical to our consolidated financial statements:

##TABLE_START &#9679; allowance for credit losses, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; operating lease residual values, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; income taxes. ##TABLE_END 

These items require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. Our accounting policies are described primarily in Note 2.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of our Receivable portfolio. The allowance is measured on a collective basis for receivables with similar risk characteristics. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Risk characteristics include: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; product category, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; market, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; geography, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; credit risk, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; remaining balance. ##TABLE_END 

We utilize the following loss forecast models to estimate expected credit losses:

##TABLE_START &#9679; Linear regression models are used for large and complex Customer Receivable pools, which represent more than 90 percent of Customer Receivables. These statistical models utilize independent variables, or predictive features, to estimate lifetime default rates, which are subsequently adjusted for expected recoveries to arrive at lifetime credit loss estimates. Independent variables include credit quality at time of application, remaining account balance, delinquency status, and various economic factors, such as commodity prices, employment levels, and housing data. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Weighted average remaining maturity (WARM) models are used for smaller and less complex Customer Receivable pools, and apply historical average annual loss rates, adjusted for current and forecasted economic conditions, to the projected portfolio runoff. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Historical loss rate models are used for wholesale receivables, with consideration of current economic conditions and dealer financial risk. ##TABLE_END 

Management reviews each model&#8217;s output quarterly, and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary to arrive at management&#8217;s best estimate of expected credit losses. See Note 2 for further information.

The allowance for credit losses at October 27, 2024, October 29, 2023, and October 30, 2022 was $227.5, $146.4, and $128.4, respectively. The allowance for credit losses increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher expected losses on retail notes as a result of elevated delinquencies and a decline in market conditions impacting the agriculture receivable portfolio. The allowance for wholesale receivables also increased due to a specific provision for a dealer experiencing financial difficulties. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the allowance on revolving charge accounts, driven by write-offs of seasonal financing program accounts and recoveries expected on those accounts in the future.

While we believe our allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of our existing Receivables portfolio, different assumptions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses. Within the Customer Receivables portfolio, credit loss estimates are dependent on a number of factors, including credit quality at time of application, remaining account balances, current delinquency levels, various economic factors and estimated recoveries on defaulted accounts. Changes in any of these factors could impact our credit losses. Conversely, changes in economic conditions have historically had limited impact on credit losses within the wholesale receivable portfolio.

Holding all other factors constant, a 10 percent increase in the linear regression models&#8217; forecasted defaults as a result of elevated levels of delinquencies, deteriorating credit quality, unfavorable economic factors, or otherwise, and a simultaneous 10 percent decrease in recovery rates would have resulted in an increase to the allowance for credit losses of approximately $50 at October 27, 2024.

Operating Lease Residual Values 

Equipment on operating leases is depreciated to the estimated residual value over the lease term. The residual values are based on several factors, including:

##TABLE_START &#9679; lease term, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; expected hours of usage, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; historical wholesale sale prices, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; return experience, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; intended equipment use, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; market dynamics and trends, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; dealer residual value guarantees. ##TABLE_END 

We review residual value estimates during the lease term. Depreciation is adjusted over the remaining lease term if residual value estimates are revised. Impairments are recorded when events or circumstances necessitate. 

At the end of the majority of leases, the equipment is disposed in the following sequence: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; The lessee has the option to purchase the equipment for the contractual residual value. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; The dealer has the option to purchase the equipment. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; The equipment is sold to a third party at the equipment&#8217;s fair value. In this situation, we may record a gain or loss for the difference between the residual value and the sale price. ##TABLE_END 

The total operating lease residual values at October 27, 2024, October 29, 2023, and October 30, 2022 were $3,786.2, $3,538.3, and $3,366.7, respectively. The increase in 2024 was primarily due to a higher operating lease portfolio.

Hypothetically, if (a) future market values for equipment on operating leases were to decrease 10 percent from our present estimates and (b) all the equipment on operating leases were returned to us for remarketing at the end of the lease term, the total unfavorable impact after consideration of dealer residual value guarantees would be approximately $65. This amount would be recognized as higher depreciation expense over the remaining term of the operating leases, or potentially as an impairment. 

Income Taxes 

We are subject to federal, state, and foreign income taxes. These tax laws can be complex. Significant judgment and interpretation is required to implement them. Changes in tax laws could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. We record our tax positions in the following categories:

##TABLE_START &#9679; current taxes, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; deferred taxes, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; uncertain tax positions. ##TABLE_END 

Deferred income taxes represent temporary differences between the tax and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. This will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. Loss carryforwards and tax credits are significant components of deferred tax asset balances. These assets are reviewed regularly for the following:

##TABLE_START &#9679; the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; tax planning strategies. ##TABLE_END 

Valuation allowances are established when we determine that the deferred tax benefit may not be realized. The recoverability analysis requires significant judgment and relies on estimates. Changes in foreign income tax laws, income for certain jurisdictions, or our tax structure could impact the valuation allowance balance. 

Some tax positions contain significant uncertainties. These positions may be challenged or disallowed by taxing authorities. If it is likely the position will be disallowed, no tax benefit is recorded. If it is likely the position will be sustained, a tax benefit is recognized. The ultimate resolution could take many years. This may result in a payment that is significantly different from the original estimate. 

See Note 14 for further information on income taxes.
