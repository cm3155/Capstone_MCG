 Item 2. &#8197; MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

All amounts are presented in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.

OVERVIEW 

Organization 

We provide financial solutions that enable John Deere customers and dealers to advance their lives and livelihoods. Through our offering of retail notes, leases, and revolving charge accounts, customers are able to finance new and used John Deere equipment, as well as parts, services, and other input costs needed to run their operations. We also provide wholesale financing to John Deere dealers. 

Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions 

John Deere announced the Smart Industrial Operating Model in 2020. This operating model is based on three focus areas: 

(a)

Production systems: A strategic alignment of products and solutions around John Deere customers&#8217; operations.

(b)

Technology stack: Investments in technology, as well as research and development, that deliver intelligent solutions to John Deere customers through digital capabilities, automation, autonomy, and alternative power technologies.

(c)

Lifecycle solutions: The integration of John Deere&#8217;s aftermarket and support capabilities to more effectively manage customer equipment, service, and technology needs across the full lifetime of a John Deere product.

John Deere&#8217;s Leap Ambitions were launched in 2022. These ambitions are designed to boost economic value and sustainability for John Deere&#8217;s customers. The ambitions align across the production systems of John Deere customers, seeking to optimize their operations to deliver better outcomes with fewer resources. As an enabling business, we are fully integrated with John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial Operating Model and are focused on providing financial solutions to help John Deere achieve its Leap Ambitions.

TRENDS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 

Our volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products. The level of John Deere retail sales and leases is responsive to a variety of economic, financial, climatic, legislative, and other factors that influence supply and demand for its products.

John Deere Trends 

Customers seek to improve profitability, productivity, and sustainability through technology. Integration of technology into equipment is a persistent market trend. John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions are intended to capitalize on this market trend. The technologies that are the focus of John Deere&#8217;s operating model are incorporated into products within each of John Deere&#8217;s operating segments. We expect this trend to persist for the foreseeable future. 

&#8203; 

Agriculture and Turf Outlook for 2024 

&#9679; John Deere expects large and small agricultural equipment sales to be down from 2023 levels across all its major markets. &#9679; Agricultural fundamentals are expected to continue to moderate in 2024 due to rising global grain stocks from excellent growing conditions, lower commodity prices, elevated interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. &#9679; Demand in the U.S. and Canada continues to be affected by declining farm income margins partially offset by stable farm balance sheets. &#9679; The U.S. equipment fleet age is elevated for tractors and in line with historic averages for combines. However, increases in used inventory levels are impacting purchasing decisions. &#9679; Sales of compact utility tractors in the U.S. are forecasted to be down due to higher interest rates, partially offset by small and mid-tractor tailwinds from improving dairy and livestock fundamentals . &#9679; In Europe, volatile weather conditions continue to drive uncertainty about crop yields and along with elevated input costs are impacting demand in the region, while the dairy and livestock sector remains steady due to stronger pricing and lower feed costs. 

Construction and Forestry Outlook for 2024 

&#9679; Construction equipment industry sales are forecasted to be down from 2023 levels. &#9679; Benefits from strong U.S. infrastructure spending and increasing manufacturing investment levels are expected to partially offset declines in housing starts, decreases in rental purchases, low levels of commercial real estate construction, and the effect of elevated inventory levels. &#9679; Roadbuilding demand remains strong in the U.S., largely offset by continuing softness in Europe. 

Company Trends 

Our net income for fiscal year 2024 is expected to be slightly higher than fiscal year 2023 primarily due to income earned on a higher average portfolio, lower dealer financing incentives, and favorable discrete tax items, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and less favorable financing spreads.

Agricultural Market Business Cycle. The agricultural market is affected by various factors including commodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields, and government policies. These factors affect farmers&#8217; income and may result in lower demand for equipment. We may experience higher receivable write-offs and losses on equipment on operating leases during unfavorable market conditions.

Interest Rates. Central bank policy interest rates increased in 2023 and have remained elevated. Most of our receivables and leases with retail customers are fixed rate, while our wholesale receivables generally are variable rate. This Receivable and Lease portfolio is financed with fixed and variable rate borrowings. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by matching the interest rate characteristics of our portfolio with our funding sources. We also enter into interest rate swap agreements to match our interest rate exposure.

Rising interest rates have historically impacted our borrowings sooner than the benefit is realized from our Receivable and Lease portfolio. As a result, we experienced $40.7 (after-tax) less favorable financing spreads in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. We expect to continue experiencing spread compression in 2024.

Higher interest rates are driven by factors outside of our control, and as a result we cannot reasonably foresee when these conditions will subside.

Other Items of Concern and Uncertainties 

Other items that could impact our results are: 

&#9679; global and regional political conditions, including the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East , &#9679; economic, tax, and trade policies, &#9679; new or retaliatory tariffs , &#9679; capital market disruptions, &#9679; foreign currency and capital control policies, &#9679; regulations and legislation regarding right to repair or right to modify, &#9679; weather conditions, &#9679; marketplace adoption, and monetization of technologies we have invested in, 

&#8203; 

&#9679; John Deere&#8217;s and our ability to strengthen our digital capabilities, automation, autonomy, and alternative power technologies, &#9679; workforce reductions impact on employee retention, morale, and institutional knowledge, &#9679; changes in demand and pricing for new and used equipment, &#9679; delays or disruptions in John Deere&#8217;s supply chain, &#9679; significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, &#9679; volatility in the prices of many commodities, and &#9679; slower economic growth or recession.

Total revenues increased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 primarily due to a 13 percent and 17 percent increase in average portfolio balances, respectively, and higher average financing rates. Net income for the quarter was lower than the same period in 2023 primarily due to a higher provision for credit losses and less favorable financing spreads, partially offset by income earned on higher average portfolio balances and favorable discrete tax items. Year-to-date net income was flat compared to 2023 primarily due to a higher provision for credit losses and less favorable financing spreads, offset by income earned on higher average portfolio balances, lower dealer financing incentives, and favorable discrete tax items.

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

Higher average portfolio balances and higher average finance rates drove increased revenues across all products for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. The change was most pronounced within wholesale receivables, due to an increase in average portfolio balances of 25 percent and 39 percent for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, due to higher dealer inventory levels.

Other income increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 due to higher credit enhancement recoveries, partially offset by lower gains on operating lease dispositions. Year-to-date results also benefited from higher interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and intercompany receivables from John Deere.

Revenues earned from John Deere totaled $287.2 for the third quarter and $857.9 for the first nine months of 2024, compared with $283.4 and $742.8 for the same periods last year, respectively. The year-to-date increases were primarily due to increased compensation paid by John Deere on wholesale receivables and retail notes driven by a higher interest rate environment, in addition to higher average portfolio balances. Revenues earned from John Deere are included in each of the revenue amounts discussed above.

&#8203; 

The increase in interest expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to higher average borrowing rates and higher average borrowings to fund a larger portfolio. 

Administrative and operating expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 decreased compared to the same periods in 2023 due to lower dealer financing incentive program costs and lower foreign exchange losses. These factors were partially offset by employee-separation costs.

Fees and interest paid to John Deere decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 due to lower interest on intercompany borrowings from John Deere, driven by lower average borrowings. 

The provision for credit losses increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared with the same periods last year due to higher net write-offs on retail notes and revolving charge accounts and an increase in allowance, driven primarily by higher expected losses on retail notes as a result of elevated delinquencies and a decline in market conditions. The annualized provision for credit losses, as a percentage of the average balance of total Receivables, was .89 percent for the third quarter and .57 percent for the first nine months of 2024, compared with .19 percent and .16 percent for the same periods last year, respectively.

The provision for income taxes decreased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 primarily due to favorable discrete tax items and lower pretax income.

Total Receivables and Leases increased $4,669.4 during the first nine months of 2024 and increased $6,028.7 compared to one year ago, driven by higher wholesale receivables and retail notes. The increase in wholesale receivables was due to higher dealer inventory levels. While agriculture and turf retail note volumes are moderating due to reduced retail demand, retail note portfolio levels continue to rise due to higher volumes in recent years.

Total Receivables 30 days or more past due, non-performing Receivables, and the allowance for credit losses were as follows (as a percentage of the Receivables balance):

We monitor the credit quality of Receivables based on delinquency status. Receivables 30 days or more past due continue to accrue finance income. We stop accruing finance income once Receivables are considered non-performing, which generally occurs once Receivables are 90 days past due. An allowance for credit losses is recorded 

&#8203; 

for the estimated credit losses expected over the life of the Receivable portfolio. We measure expected credit losses on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Risk characteristics include product category, market, geography, credit risk, and remaining balance. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics with other receivables in the portfolio are evaluated on an individual basis. Non-performing Receivables are included in the estimate of expected credit losses. While we believe our allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of our existing Receivable portfolio, different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses. See Note 4 for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses.

Deposits held from dealers and merchants amounted to $127.0 at July 28, 2024, compared with $138.4 at October 29, 2023 and $132.9 at July 30, 2023. These balances primarily represent the aggregate dealer retail note and lease deposits from individual John Deere dealers to which losses from retail notes and leases originating from the respective dealers can be charged. Recoveries from dealer deposits are recognized in &#8220;Other income&#8221; when the dealer&#8217;s deposit account is charged. 

We also utilize other freestanding credit enhancements, such as credit insurance and bank guarantees, to mitigate credit risk. Recoveries from these freestanding credit enhancements are generally recognized when the associated credit loss is recorded. Recoveries from dealer deposits and other freestanding credit enhancements recorded in &#8220;Other income&#8221; were $26.6 in the third quarter and $39.1 for the first nine months of 2024, compared with $3.4 and $9.2 for the same periods last year, respectively. The increases were driven by expected recoveries on bank guarantee contracts, which relate to a specific allowance on wholesale receivables. See Note 4 for additional information.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

See our critical accounting estimates discussed in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to these estimates. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY &#8211; 2024 COMPARED WITH 2023 

We rely on our ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance our Receivable and Lease portfolios. We have access to global capital markets at a reasonable cost and our ability to meet our debt obligations is supported in several ways. Sources of liquidity include: 

&#9679; cash and cash equivalents, &#9679; the issuance of commercial paper and term debt, &#9679; the securitization of retail notes, &#9679; intercompany loans from John Deere, &#9679; our Receivable and Lease portfolio, which is self-liquidating in nature, and &#9679; bank lines of credit. 

We closely monitor our liquidity sources against the cash requirements and expect to have sufficient sources of global funding and liquidity to meet our funding needs in the short-term (next 12 months) and long-term (beyond 12 months).

Net cash was used for investing activities during the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to growth in the wholesale and retail note portfolios, which were funded primarily through external borrowings and cash provided by operating activities.

Borrowings 

Total borrowings increased $5,028.9 in the first nine months of 2024 and increased $5,859.3 compared to a year ago, generally corresponding with the level of the Receivable and Lease portfolios. During the first nine months of 2024, we issued $10,768.7 and retired $4,031.5 of long-term external borrowings, which primarily consisted of medium-term notes. During the first nine months of 2024, we also issued $3,721.9 and retired $2,848.7 of retail note securitization borrowings and maintained an average commercial paper balance of $5,880.0. Our funding profile may be altered to reflect such factors as relative costs of funding sources, assets available for securitizations, and capital market accessibility.

We have a revolving warehouse facility to utilize bank conduit facilities to securitize retail notes (see Note 5). The facility was renewed in November 2023 with an expiration in November 2024 and with an increase in the total capacity or &#8220;financing limit&#8221; from $1,500.0 to $2,000.0. At July 28, 2024, $1,566.1 of securitization borrowings were outstanding under the facility. At the end of the contractual revolving period, unless we and the banks agree to renew, we would liquidate the secured borrowings over time as payments on the retail notes are collected.

Lines of Credit 

We have access to bank lines of credit with various banks throughout the world. Some of the lines are available to both us and Deere &#38; Company. 

Worldwide lines of credit were $10,653.5 at July 28, 2024, consisting primarily of: 

&#9679; a 364-day credit facility agreement of $5,000.0 expiring in the second quarter of 2025, &#9679; a credit facility agreement of $2,750.0 expiring in the second quarter of 2028, and &#9679; a credit facility agreement of $2,750.0 expiring in the second quarter of 2029. 

At July 28, 2024, $4,917.3 of these worldwide lines of credit were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings of us and John Deere were considered to constitute utilization. 

The credit agreements governing these lines of credit require us to maintain a consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for any four consecutive fiscal quarterly periods and our ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholder&#8217;s equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. All of these credit agreement requirements have been met during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements. The agreements are mutually extendable, and the annual facility fees are not significant.

&#8203; 

Debt Ratings 

Our ability to obtain funding is affected by our debt ratings, which are closely related to the outlook for and the financial condition of John Deere, and the nature and availability of support facilities, such as our lines of credit and the support agreement from Deere &#38; Company.

To access public debt capital markets, we rely on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to our debt securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A security rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell, or hold. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw ratings based on its assessment of our current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agency&#8217;s rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, reduced access to debt capital markets, and may adversely impact our liquidity. 

The senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to our unsecured debt securities by the rating agencies engaged by us are the same as those for John Deere and are as follows:
