The Company 

Capital Corporation was incorporated under the laws of Delaware and commenced operations in 1958. All of our outstanding common stock is owned by John Deere Financial Services, Inc. (JDFS), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deere &#38; Company. See &#8220;Our Relationships with John Deere&#8221; for additional information regarding agreements between us and Deere &#38; Company. We conduct business in Australia, New Zealand, the United States (U.S.), and in several countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, including Argentina, Chile, and Mexico. 

We provide and administer financing for retail purchases of new equipment manufactured by Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s production and precision agriculture operations, small agriculture and turf operations, and construction and forestry operations and used equipment taken in trade for this equipment. References to &#8220;agriculture and turf&#8221; include both production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf.

Business of John Deere 

John Deere&#8217;s operations are categorized into four business segments:

The production and precision agriculture segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions for production-scale growers of crops like large grains (such as corn and soy), small grains (such as wheat, oats, and barley), cotton, and sugarcane. Equipment manufactured and distributed by the segment includes large and certain mid-size tractors, combines, cotton pickers, cotton strippers, sugarcane harvesters, and related harvesting front-end equipment. In addition, the segment includes tillage, seeding, and application equipment, including sprayers and nutrient management and soil preparation machinery. 

The small agriculture and turf segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions designed to unlock customer value and sustainability for dairy and livestock producers, high-value crop and small acreage crop producers, and turf and utility customers. Equipment manufactured and distributed by the segment includes certain mid-size, small and utility tractors, and related loaders and attachments; turf and utility equipment, including riding lawn equipment, commercial mowing equipment, golf course equipment, utility vehicles, implements for mowing, tilling, snow and debris handling, aerating, and other residential, commercial, golf, and sports turf care applications; and hay and forage equipment, including self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers, and mowers.

The construction and forestry segment delivers a robust portfolio of construction, roadbuilding, and forestry products with precision technology solutions. The segment&#8217;s primary construction products include excavators, wheel loaders, motor graders, dozers, backhoes, articulated dump trucks, compact construction equipment including skid steers, compact excavators, and compact truck loaders, along with a variety of attachments. The segment&#8217;s primary roadbuilding products include milling machines, pavers, compactors, rollers, crushers, screens, and asphalt plants, and the primary forestry products include skidders, wheeled and tracked feller bunchers, forwarders, knuckleboom loaders, wheeled and tracked harvesters, swing machines, and precision forestry technology solutions. 

The products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets. For roadbuilding products in certain markets outside the U.S. and Canada, the products are sold through John Deere-owned sales and service subsidiaries.

The financial services segment includes our operations (described herein) and additional operations in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, China, India, and Thailand. The segment primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used production and precision agriculture equipment, small agriculture and turf equipment, and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, finances retail revolving charge accounts, and, in certain jurisdictions, offers extended equipment warranties.

John Deere&#8217;s worldwide production and precision agriculture operations, small agriculture and turf operations, and construction and forestry operations are sometimes collectively referred to as the &#8220;equipment operations.&#8221; The financial services segment is sometimes referred to as the &#8220;financial services operations.&#8221; Receivables and Leases managed by us are evaluated by market (agriculture and turf or construction and forestry). 

For fiscal 2024, worldwide net income attributable to Deere &#38; Company was $7,100, or $25.62 per share, compared with $10,166, or $34.63 per share, in fiscal 2023.

Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s consolidated net sales and revenues decreased 16 percent to $51,716 in 2024, compared with $61,251 in 2023. Net sales of the equipment operations decreased in fiscal 2024 to $44,759, compared with $55,565 last year, due to lower sales volumes. 

The financial services operations reported net income of $696 for fiscal 2024 compared with $619 in fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of a one-time correction of the accounting treatment for financing incentives offered to John Deere dealers in 2023, net income declined as a result of a higher provision for credit losses and less favorable financing spreads driven primarily by the receivable portfolio mix. These factors were partially offset by income earned on higher average portfolio balances. 

Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions 

John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial Operating Model is based on the following three focus areas: 

##TABLE_START (a) Production systems: A strategic alignment of products and solutions around John Deere customers&#8217; operations. Production systems refer to the series of steps John Deere's customers take to execute different tasks, operations, and projects to grow an agricultural product or execute a project. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) Technology stack: Investments in technology, as well as research and development, that deliver intelligent solutions to John Deere customers through hardware and devices, embedded software, connectivity, data platforms, and applications. The technology stack leverages these core technologies, including digital capabilities, automation and machine learning, autonomy, and alternative power technologies. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (c) Lifecycle solutions: The integration of John Deere&#8217;s aftermarket and support capabilities to more effectively manage customer equipment, service, and technology needs across the full lifetime of a John Deere product, and with a specific lifecycle solution focus on the ownership experience. ##TABLE_END 

John Deere&#8217;s Leap Ambitions are a framework designed to boost economic value and sustainability for its customers. The Leap Ambitions set goals to measure the results of John Deere's Smart Industrial Operating Model. The ambitions align across the production systems of John Deere customers, seeking to optimize their operations to deliver better outcomes with fewer resources. As an enabling business, we are fully integrated with John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial Operating Model and are focused on providing financial solutions to help John Deere achieve its Leap Ambitions. 

Our Relationships with John Deere 

Our results of operations are affected by our relationships with John Deere, including, among other items, the terms on which we acquire Receivables and borrow funds from John Deere, the reimbursement for interest waiver and low-rate finance programs from John Deere, the compensation paid by John Deere in connection with our purchase of trade receivables from John Deere, the payment to John Deere for various expenses applicable to our operations, and payments made to or received from John Deere related to our international support agreement with John Deere. In addition, we have joint access with John Deere to certain lines of credit.

Our volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products. The level of John Deere retail sales and leases is responsive to a variety of economic, financial, geopolitical, climatic, legislative, and other factors that influence supply and demand for its products. The majority of our business is affected by changes in interest rates, demand for credit, and competition.

We bear substantially all of the credit risk (net of recovery from withholdings from certain John Deere dealers and merchants) associated with our holding of Receivables and Leases. A small portion of the Receivables and Leases held (less than 5 percent) is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of Deere &#38; Company. We also perform substantially all servicing and collection functions. Servicing and collection functions for a small portion of the Receivables and Leases held (less than 5 percent) are provided by John Deere. John Deere is reimbursed for staff and other administrative services at estimated cost and for credit lines provided to us based on utilization of those lines.

The terms and the basis on which we acquire retail notes and certain wholesale receivables from John Deere are governed by agreements with John Deere, generally terminable by either John Deere or us on 30 days&#8217; notice. As provided in these agreements, we agree to the terms and conditions for purchasing the retail notes and wholesale receivables from John Deere. Under these agreements, John Deere is not obligated to sell notes to us, and we are obligated to purchase notes from John Deere only if the notes comply with the terms and conditions set by us.

The basis on which John Deere acquires retail notes from John Deere dealers is governed by agreements with those dealers, which may be terminated in accordance with their terms and applicable law. The dealers are not obligated to sell these notes to John Deere and John Deere is not obligated to accept these notes from the dealers. In practice, retail notes are acquired from dealers only if the terms of these notes and the creditworthiness of the customers are acceptable to us. We act on behalf of both ourselves and John Deere in determining the acceptability of the notes and in acquiring acceptable notes from dealers.

The basis on which we enter into leases with retail customers through John Deere dealers is governed by agreements between those dealers and us. Leases are accepted based on the terms and conditions of the agreements, the lessees&#8217; creditworthiness, the anticipated residual values of the equipment, and the intended use of the equipment.

Deere &#38; Company has an agreement with us pursuant to which it has agreed to continue to own, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to maintain our consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50.0. This agreement also obligates Deere &#38; Company to make payments to us such that our consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for any four consecutive fiscal quarterly periods. Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s obligations to make payments to us under the agreement are independent of whether we are in default on our indebtedness, obligations, or other liabilities. Further, Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of our indebtedness, obligations, or other liabilities. Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guarantee of any specific indebtedness, obligation, or liability of ours and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. No payments were required under this agreement during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements. At October 27, 2024, Deere &#38; Company indirectly owned 100 percent of the voting shares of Capital Corporation&#8217;s capital stock and our consolidated tangible net worth was $6,226.2.

We also have an international support agreement with Deere &#38; Company, pursuant to which we and Deere &#38; Company have agreed to make periodic support payments to each other if and to the extent necessary to ensure our businesses in certain international markets, including Argentina, Chile, and Mexico, earn a specified target return on equity. Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guarantee of any specific indebtedness, obligation, or liability of ours. 

We purchase certain wholesale trade receivables from John Deere. These trade receivables arise from John Deere&#8217;s sales of goods to independent dealers. Under the terms of the sales to dealers, interest is primarily charged to dealers on outstanding balances from the earlier of the date when goods are sold to retail customers by the dealer or the expiration of certain interest-free periods granted at the time of the sale to the dealer, until payment is received by us. Dealers cannot cancel purchases after John Deere recognizes a sale and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to retail customers. The interest-free periods are determined based on the type of equipment sold and the time of year of the sale. These periods range from one to twelve months for most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be extended. Interest charged may not be forgiven and the rates on past due interest exceed market rates. We receive compensation from John Deere at approximate market interest rates for these interest-free periods. We compute the compensation from John Deere for interest-free periods based on our estimated funding costs, administrative and operating expenses, credit losses, and required return on equity.

A portion of finance income earned by us arises from financing of retail sales of John Deere equipment on which finance charges are waived or reduced by John Deere for a period from the date of the retail sale to a specified subsequent date. We receive compensation from John Deere equal to competitive market interest rates for periods during which finance charges have been waived or reduced. We compute the compensation from John Deere for waived or reduced finance charges based on our estimated funding costs, administrative and operating expenses, credit losses, and required return on equity. The financing rate following the waiver or interest reduction period is not significantly different from the compensation rate from John Deere.

Description of Receivables and Leases 

Receivables and Leases arise mainly from retail and wholesale sales and leases of John Deere products and used equipment accepted in trade for them, and from retail sales of equipment of unrelated manufacturers. Receivables and Leases also include revolving charge receivables. At October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023, at least 90 percent of the Receivables and Leases administered by us were for financing that facilitated the purchase or lease of John Deere products.

John Deere Financial, f.s.b. (Thrift) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Capital Corporation. It holds a federal thrift charter and is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The U.S. Federal Reserve Board has oversight of us, as the owner of the Thrift. The Thrift is headquartered in Wisconsin and offers the following revolving charge products throughout the U.S.:

##TABLE_START &#9679; John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account TM is used by farmers and ranchers to finance their purchases of production inputs from agribusiness merchants, including seed, fertilizer, and crop protection. It is also used by agriculture and turf customers to finance the purchase of parts and service from John Deere dealers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#9679; PowerPlan TM is used by construction and forestry customers to finance the purchase of equipment parts, equipment rentals, and service work performed at John Deere construction and forestry dealers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; John Deere Financial Revolving Plan is used by retail customers of John Deere dealers to finance purchases of turf and utility equipment. ##TABLE_END 

We provide wholesale financing to John Deere dealers, primarily to finance agriculture and turf and construction and forestry equipment inventories. A large portion of the wholesale financing is provided by us to dealers from whom we also purchase agriculture and turf and construction and forestry retail notes. 

We generally require that theft and physical damage insurance be carried on all goods leased or securing retail notes and wholesale receivables. In certain markets, the customer may, at the customer&#8217;s own expense, have us or the seller of the goods purchase this insurance or obtain it from other sources. Insurance is not required for goods purchased under revolving charge accounts.

Receivables and Leases are eligible for acceptance if they conform to prescribed finance and lease plan terms. In limited circumstances, Receivables and Leases may be accepted even though they do not conform in all respects to the established guidelines. We determine whether Receivables and Leases should be accepted and how they should be serviced. Acceptance of these Receivables and Leases is dependent on having one or more risk mitigation enhancements that may include larger down payments or advance lease payments, additional co-borrowers or guarantors, the pledge of additional collateral as security, the assignment of specific earnings to us, or the acceptance of accelerated payment schedules. Our officers are responsible for establishing policies and reviewing our performance in accepting and collecting Receivables and Leases. We perform substantially all of our own routine collections, settlements, and repossessions on Receivables and Leases.

John Deere retail notes and wholesale receivables are generally supported by perfected security interests in goods financed under laws such as the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), certain federal statutes, and state motor vehicle laws in the U.S. and by security in goods or other security under applicable laws in other countries and jurisdictions. UCC financing statements are also prepared and filed on leases; however, these filings for operating leases are made for informational purposes only.

Finance Rates on Retail Notes 

As of October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023, over 95 percent of the retail notes held by us bore a fixed finance rate. A portion of the finance income earned by us arises from reimbursements from John Deere in connection with financing the retail sales of John Deere equipment on which finance charges are waived or reduced by John Deere for a period from the date of sale to a specified subsequent date. See Note 3 for additional information.

Average Original Term and Average Actual Life of Retail Notes and Leases 

Due to prepayments (often from trade-ins and refinancing), the average actual life of retail notes and leases is considerably shorter than the average original term. The following table shows the average original term for retail notes and leases acquired during the year and the average actual life for retail notes and leases liquidated during the year (in months):

Net Write-offs 

Receivable balances are written off to the allowance for credit losses when, in the judgment of management, they are considered uncollectible.

The credit quality metrics summarized above have declined in 2024 due to unfavorable market conditions, which led to an increase in past due and non-performing receivables, as well as a higher allowance for credit losses.

Competition 

The businesses in which we are engaged are highly competitive. We primarily compete for customers with commercial banks and finance and leasing companies based upon our service, finance rates charged, and other finance terms. In addition, the competitive landscape is evolving as technology is unlocking new capabilities for traditional competitors and enabling new digital entrants that could be either technology partners or potential competitors. The proportion of John Deere equipment retail sales and leases financed by us is influenced by conditions prevailing in the agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment markets, in the financial markets, and in business generally. We financed a significant portion of John Deere equipment retail sales and leases in many of the countries in which we operated during 2024 and 2023.

We emphasize convenient service to customers and endeavor to offer terms desired in our specialized markets, such as seasonal schedules of repayment and rentals. Our retail finance rates and lease rates are generally believed to be in the range offered by other sales finance and leasing companies, although not as low as those of some banks and other lenders and lessors.

Regulation 

In several U.S. states, state law limits the maximum finance rate on receivables. The present state limitations have not significantly limited variable-rate finance charges or the fixed-rate finance charges established by us. However, if interest rate levels should increase significantly, maximum state rates could affect us by preventing the variable rates on outstanding variable-rate retail notes from increasing above the maximum state rate and by limiting the fixed rates on new notes. In some states, we may be able to qualify new retail notes for a higher maximum rate limit by using retail installment sales contracts (rather than loan contracts) or by using fixed-rate rather than variable-rate contracts.

In addition to rate regulations, various U.S. state and federal laws and regulations apply to some Receivables and Leases, principally retail notes for goods sold for personal, family, or household use and John Deere Financial Revolving Plan, John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account TM , and PowerPlan TM products and receivables. To date, these laws and regulations have not had a significant adverse effect on us.

The Thrift holds a federal thrift charter and is subject to regulation and examination by the OCC. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board has oversight of us, as the owner of the Thrift.

Our financing offers outside the U.S. are affected by a variety of country specific laws, regulations, and customs, including those governing property rights and debtor obligations, and are subject to changes that may introduce greater risks to us.

In fiscal year 2024, compliance with the regulations applicable to us did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We do not expect to incur material capital expenditures related to compliance with regulations during fiscal year 2025. Additional information about the impact of government regulations on our business is included in Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; under the heading &#8220;Compliance Risks.&#8221;

Human Capital 

Our employees are guided by a simple principle: We run so life can leap forward. Employees are further guided by John Deere&#8217;s Code of Business Conduct (&#8220;Code&#8221;), which helps them to uphold and strengthen the standards of honor and integrity that have defined John Deere since its founding. And while our world and business may change, we continue to be guided by our core values&#8212;Integrity, Quality, Humanity, Commitment and Innovation. Humanity was added as our fifth core value in fiscal year 2024.

Employees 

At October 27, 2024, we had 1,338 full-time and part-time employees. We also retain consultants, independent contractors, and temporary workers.

Code of Business Conduct 

We are committed to conducting business in accordance with the highest ethical standards. We require all employees to complete training on our Code and also require that employees regularly certify compliance with the Code. The Code provides specific guidance to all our employees outlining how they can and must uphold and strengthen the integrity that has defined John Deere since its founding. In addition, we maintain a global compliance hotline to report concerns of potential violations of the Code, global policies, or the law.

Workplace Practices and Policies 

We are an equal opportunity employer committed to providing a workplace free of harassment and discrimination. We believe that a diverse workforce that reflects the communities we serve is essential to our long-term success. For recruiting and development opportunities, we work with a variety of professional organizations to support a diverse pipeline of candidates representing the fields of accounting, agriculture, engineering, general business, science, and technology, and provide development opportunities for employees.

Compensation &#38; Benefits 

Our total rewards are intended to be competitive, meet the varied needs of our global workforce, and reinforce our values. We are committed to providing comprehensive and competitive pay and benefits to our employees. We continue to invest in employees through growth and development and well-being initiatives. 

Our work environment is designed to promote innovation, well-being, and reward performance. Our total rewards for employees include a variety of components that aim to support our employees in building a strong financial future, including competitive market-based pay and comprehensive benefits. In addition to earning base pay, eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to our goals with both short-term cash incentives and long-term equity-based incentives.

Eligible full-time employees in the U.S. have access to medical, dental, and vision plans; savings and retirement plans; parental leave and paid time off; and mental health and wellness services. We also offer a variety of working arrangements to eligible employees, including flexible schedules, remote work, and job sharing to help employees manage home and work-life situations. Programs and benefits differ internationally for a variety of reasons, such as local legal requirements, market practices, and negotiations with works councils and other employee representative bodies.

Training and Development 

Around the world, we offer internships, training, upskilling, apprenticeships, and leadership development at all stages of an employee&#8217;s career. Training programs are tailored to different geographic regions and job functions and include topics such as relationships with customers and dealers, our culture and values, compliance with the Code, compliance with anti-bribery/corruption laws and policies, compliance with management of private data and cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, conflicts of interest, discrimination and workplace harassment policies, sexual harassment policies, and leadership development.
