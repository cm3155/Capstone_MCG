 Item 1A. Risk Factors .

See the Company&#8217;s most recent annual report on Form 10-K (Part I, Item 1A). 

The COVID pandemic resulted in additional risks that could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. 

COVID was identified in late 2019 and has spread globally. The rapid spread has resulted in governments and other authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. These measures have impacted and may further impact all or portions of the Company&#8217;s workforce and operations and the operations of customers. We have operations in the U.S. and other countries, each of which have been affected by the pandemic and taken containment measures. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding such measures and potential future measures. Restrictions on the Company&#8217;s workforce&#8217;s access to its facilities could limit its ability to meet customer servicing expectations and have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. There is no certainty that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and the Company&#8217;s ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.

The COVID pandemic has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of capital and adversely impacts access to capital. It is likely that the COVID pandemic has caused an economic slowdown, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. These events could affect the value of the equipment financed or leased, the demand for financings and the financial condition and credit risk of our dealers and customers. Risks related to negative economic conditions are described in our risk factor titled &#8220;Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deere&#8217;s equipment and services, limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs for the Company and John Deere&#8221; under &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 3, 2019.

Uncertainties related to the magnitude and duration of the COVID pandemic may significantly adversely affect John Deere&#8217;s and the Company&#8217;s business and outlook. These uncertainties include: prolonged reduction or closure of John Deere&#8217;s and the Company&#8217;s operations, or a delayed recovery in such operations; additional closures as mandated or otherwise made necessary by governmental authorities; additional operating costs at facilities that remain open due to remote working arrangements, adherence to social distancing guidelines and other COVID-related challenges; absence of employees due to illness; requests by the Company&#8217;s customers or dealers for payment deferrals and contract modifications; the impact of disruptions in the global capital markets and/or continued declines in John Deere&#8217;s and the Company&#8217;s financial performance, outlook or credit ratings, which could impact John Deere&#8217;s and the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain funding in the future; and the impact of the pandemic on demand for John Deere&#8217;s products and services. It is unclear when an economic recovery could occur and what a recovery may look like. All of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial position.

The ultimate magnitude of COVID effects, including the extent of its impact on the Company&#8217;s financial and operational results, which could be material, will be determined by the length of time that the pandemic continues, its effect on the demand for our services, as well as the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic. We cannot at this time predict the impact of the COVID pandemic, but it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.

There has been no additional material change to the other risks included in the most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K. The risks described in the annual report on Form 10-K, and the &#8220;Safe Harbor Statement&#8221; in this 

report, are not the only risks faced by the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties may also materially affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition or operating results. One should not consider the risk factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions.
