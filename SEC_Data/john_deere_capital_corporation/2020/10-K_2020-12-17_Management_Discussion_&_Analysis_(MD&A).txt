 Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Results of Operations 

Overview 

Organization 

The Company primarily generates revenues and cash by financing John Deere dealers&#8217; sales and leases of new and used agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the Company also provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment and finances retail revolving charge accounts.

Trends and Economic Conditions 

The Company&#8217;s acquisition volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products. The level of John Deere retail sales and leases is responsive to a variety of economic, financial, climatic, legislative, and other factors that influence demand for its products. 

Agriculture &#38; Turf. John Deere&#8217;s agriculture and turf equipment sales decreased 6 percent in 2020. Industry agricultural machinery sales in the U.S. and Canada for 2021 are forecast to increase 5 to 10 percent, compared to 2020. Industry sales in Europe are forecast to be about the same to 5 percent higher, and South American industry sales of tractors and combines are forecast to be about 5 percent higher in 2021. Asian sales are also forecast to be slightly lower. Industry sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be about the same to 5 percent higher. 

Construction &#38; Forestry. John Deere&#8217;s construction and forestry sales decreased 20 percent in 2020. On an industry basis, North American construction equipment sales are expected to be down about 5 percent with sales of compact equipment up about 5 percent. Global forestry industry sales are expected to be about the same to about 5 percent higher than 2020 sales.

Items of concern include uncertainty of the effectiveness of governmental and private sector actions to address COVID, trade agreements, the uncertainty of the results of monetary and fiscal policies, the impact of elevated levels of sovereign and state debt, capital market disruptions, changes in demand and pricing for new and used equipment, and geopolitical events. Significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and volatility in the price of many commodities could also impact John Deere&#8217;s and the Company&#8217;s results. The future financial effects of COVID are unknown due to many factors. As a result, predicting the Company&#8217;s forecasted financial performance is difficult and subject to many assumptions.

In the face of the ongoing challenges associated with managing the global pandemic, John Deere was able to complete a successful year and is positioned to continue providing differentiated solutions for customers. John Deere expects to benefit from improving conditions in the farm economy and stabilization in construction and forestry markets. 

COVID Effects and Actions 

During 2020, the effects of COVID and the related actions of governments and other authorities to contain COVID, have affected the Company&#8217;s operations, results, cash flows, and forecasts. 

The Company&#8217;s first priority in addressing the effects of COVID continues to be the health, safety, and overall welfare of its employees. The Company effectively activated previously established business continuity plans and proactively implemented health and safety measures at its operations around the world. 

The economic effects of COVID have reduced customer demand for some of John Deere&#8217;s products and services, particularly construction and forestry equipment, which resulted in lower shipment volumes. During most of 2020, all of John Deere&#8217;s factories have operated, some at reduced capacity due to component shortages or lower demand. As a result, the Company&#8217;s acquisition volume of wholesale receivables decreased during 2020. However, the Company&#8217;s acquisition volume of Receivables and Leases (excluding wholesale) was slightly higher in 2020 when compared to 2019. 

The Company worked closely with its customers, including John Deere dealers and retail customers, during 2020 and, as necessary, provided short-term relief on obligations owed to the Company in response to the economic effects of COVID on customers. The relief was provided in regional programs and on a case-by-case basis with customers that were generally current in their payment obligations. For retail customers, the relief generally included payment deferrals of three months or less and primarily related to construction accounts. The relief provided to dealers generally included payment deferrals of three months or less and short-term interest rate reductions in certain markets and primarily related to agriculture and turf dealers. The Receivables and Leases granted relief represented approximately 4 percent of the Receivable and Lease portfolio at November 1, 2020 (See Notes 5 and 7).

2020 Compared with 2019 

The total revenues and net income attributable to the Company were as follows (in millions of dollars):

##TABLE_END Total revenues decreased in 2020 due to lower financing rates, partially offset by a higher average portfolio. Net income in 2020 was about the same as in 2019 with lower impairments and reduced losses on operating lease residual values, and income from a higher average portfolio, largely offset by a higher provision for credit losses and unfavorable financing spreads. The 2019 net income was also affected by favorable discrete adjustments to the provision for income taxes.

##TABLE_END Finance income on retail notes increased slightly in 2020 due to higher average portfolio, partially offset by lower average financing rates. Finance income on revolving charge accounts decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower average financing rates, while finance income on wholesale receivables decreased due to lower average financing rates and lower 

average portfolio. The increase in lease revenues was primarily due to higher lease payments, higher compensation from John Deere on operating leases, and higher average portfolio balances.

Revenues earned from John Deere totaled $669.5 million in 2020, compared with $746.0 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily the result of lower compensation paid by John Deere for waived or reduced finance charges on wholesale receivables due to lower average financing rates and lower average portfolio. Revenues earned from John Deere are included in the revenue amounts discussed above and in &#8220;Other income&#8221; on the statement of consolidated income.

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

##TABLE_END The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower average borrowing rates. 

The decrease in administrative and operating expenses was primarily due to lower impairments and reduced losses on operating lease residual values, partially offset by foreign exchange losses and higher employee-separation expenses.

The provision for credit losses increased primarily due to an increase in the allowance for credit losses and higher net write-offs of retail notes. The provision for credit losses, as a percentage of the total average balance of Receivables financed, was .27 percent for 2020 and .14 percent for 2019.

The depreciation of equipment on operating leases increased primarily due to updated depreciation estimates and higher average balances of equipment on operating leases.

The higher provision for income taxes in 2020 was primarily related to favorable discrete tax adjustments in the prior year as well as a higher effective tax rate and higher pretax income in the current year. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Receivables and Leases Acquired and Held

##TABLE_END * The delinquency status of Receivables granted relief due to COVID is based on the modified payment schedule (See Note 5).

Receivables 30 days or more past due continue to accrue finance income. The Company ceases to accrue finance income once Receivables are considered non-performing. An allowance for credit losses is recorded for the estimated uncollectible amount. The allowance for credit losses is subject to an ongoing evaluation based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical net loss experience by product category, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions in the Company&#8217;s major markets and geographies, commodity price trends, and credit risk quality. The Company believes its allowance is sufficient to provide for losses inherent in its existing Receivable portfolio. See Note 5 for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses.

Deposits withheld from dealers and merchants, representing mainly the aggregate dealer retail note and lease withholding accounts from individual John Deere dealers to which losses from retail notes and leases originating from the respective dealers can be charged, amounted to $114.8 million at November 1, 2020, compared with $137.5 million at November 3, 2019.

2019 Compared with 2018 

The comparison of the 2019 results with 2018 can be found under the heading &#8220;2019 Compared with 2018&#8221; in the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; section of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K , which comparison is incorporated by reference herein.

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

The cash provided by operating activities was used primarily to fund Receivables and Leases. Cash provided by operating activities was $1,450.2 million in 2020. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1,335.6 million in 2020, primarily due to the cost of Receivables acquired (excluding wholesale) exceeding the collections of Receivables (excluding wholesale) by $2,291.1 million and the cost of equipment on operating leases acquired exceeding the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $570.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in wholesale receivables of $1,649.1 million. Cash used for financing activities totaled $55.7 million, resulting primarily from a net decrease in total external borrowings of $3,047.8 million and dividends paid of $275.0 million, partially offset by an increase in payables to John Deere of $3,291.8 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased $58.5 million during 2020.

Over the last three years, operating activities have provided $4,399.3 million in cash. In addition, an increase in total borrowings of $5,083.3 million provided cash inflows. These amounts have been used mainly to fund Receivable and Lease acquisitions, which exceeded collections of Receivables and proceeds from sale of equipment on operating leases by $8,443.2 million, and to pay $980.0 million in dividends. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased $412.0 million over the three-year period.

The Company relies on its ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance its Receivable and Lease portfolios. The Company has access to most global markets at reasonable costs and expects to have sufficient sources of global funding and liquidity to meet its funding needs. The Company&#8217;s ability to meet its debt obligations is supported in several ways. The assets of the Company are self-liquidating in nature. A solid equity position is available to absorb unusual losses on these assets and all commercial paper is backed by unsecured, committed borrowing lines from various banks. Liquidity is also provided by the Company&#8217;s ability to securitize these assets and through the issuance of term debt. Additionally, liquidity may be provided through loans from John Deere. The Company&#8217;s commercial paper outstanding at November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019 was $125.0 million and $1,345.5 million, respectively, while the total cash, 

cash equivalents, and marketable securities position was $676.8 million and $635.8 million, respectively. The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $163.7 million and $134.7 million at November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019, respectively.

Capital Corporation has a revolving credit agreement to utilize bank conduit facilities to securitize retail notes (See Note 6). At November 1, 2020, this facility had a total capacity, or &#8220;financing limit,&#8221; of $3,500.0 million of secured financings at any time. The facility was renewed in November 2020 with a capacity of $2,000 million. After a two-year revolving period, unless the banks and Capital Corporation agree to renew, Capital Corporation would liquidate the secured borrowings over time as payments on the retail notes are collected. At November 1, 2020, $1,802.3 million of short-term securitization borrowings was outstanding under the agreement.

During 2020, the Company issued $3,561.9 million and retired $5,719.7 million of long-term borrowings, which were primarily medium-term notes. During 2020, the Company also issued $3,274.3 million and retired $2,895.2 million of retail note securitization borrowings and maintained an average commercial paper balance of $1,259.9 million. At November 1, 2020, the Company&#8217;s funding profile included $187.5 million of commercial paper and other notes payable, $4,656.2 million of securitization borrowings, $5,249.5 million of intercompany loans from John Deere, $25,052.7 million of unsecured term debt, and $4,298.2 million of equity capital. The Company&#8217;s funding profile may be altered to reflect such factors as relative costs of funding sources, assets available for securitizations, and capital market accessibility.

Total interest-bearing indebtedness amounted to $35,145.9 million at November 1, 2020, compared with $34,362.2 million at November 3, 2019. Total short-term indebtedness amounted to $15,834.8 million at November 1, 2020, compared with $13,309.8 million at November 3, 2019. Total long-term indebtedness amounted to $19,311.1 million at November 1, 2020, compared with $21,052.4 million at November 3, 2019. The ratio of total interest-bearing debt, including securitization indebtedness, to stockholder&#8217;s equity was 8.2 to 1 and 8.3 to 1 at November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019, respectively.

Stockholder&#8217;s equity was $4,298.2 million at November 1, 2020, compared with $4,128.4 million at November 3, 2019. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to net income attributable to the Company of $425.0 million and a change in the cumulative translation adjustment of $18.9 million, partially offset by dividend payments of $275.0 million.

Capital Corporation declared and paid cash dividends to JDFS of $275.0 million in 2020 and $330.0 million in 2019. In turn, JDFS paid comparable dividends to Deere &#38; Company.

Lines of Credit 

The Company has access to bank lines of credit with various banks throughout the world. Some of the lines are available to both the Company and Deere &#38; Company. Worldwide lines of credit totaled $8,062.5 million at November 1, 2020, $6,801.2 million of which were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings, excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term borrowings, of the Company and John Deere were primarily considered to constitute utilization. Included in the total credit lines at November 1, 2020 was a 364-day credit facility agreement of $3,000.0 million, expiring in fiscal April 2021. In addition, total credit lines included long-term credit facility agreements of $2,500.0 million, expiring in fiscal April 2024, and $2,500.0 million, expiring in fiscal April 2025. The agreements are mutually extendable and the annual facility fees are not significant. These credit agreements require the Company to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter and its ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholder&#8217;s equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. All of the requirements of the credit agreements have been met during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.

Debt Ratings 

The Company&#8217;s ability to obtain funding is affected by its debt ratings, which are closely related to the outlook for and the financial condition of John Deere, and the nature and availability of support facilities, such as its lines of credit and the support agreement with Deere &#38; Company.

To access public debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to the Company&#8217;s securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw Company ratings based on its assessment of the Company&#8217;s current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agency&#8217;s rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, and reduced access to debt capital markets.

The senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to unsecured Company debt securities by the rating agencies engaged by the Company are the same as those for John Deere. Those ratings are as follows:

Actions by central banks, financial, and securities regulators may affect the costs and expenses of financing the Company and the financing rates it is able to offer. The Company&#8217;s business is affected by general economic conditions in the global markets in which the Company operates because deteriorating economic conditions and political instability can result in decreased customer confidence, lower demand for equipment, higher credit losses, and greater currency risk. The Company&#8217;s business is also affected by actions of banks, financing and leasing companies, and other lenders that compete with the Company for customers; capital market disruptions; significant changes in capital market liquidity and associated funding costs; interest rates (including the availability of IBOR reference rates) and foreign currency exchange rates and their volatility; changes to and compliance with privacy regulations; changes to and compliance with economic sanctions and export controls laws and regulations; compliance with U.S. and foreign laws when expanding to new markets and otherwise; actions by other regulatory bodies; changes in weather patterns; the political and social stability of the global markets in which the Company operates; the effects of, or response to, terrorism and security threats; wars and other conflicts; natural disasters; and the spread of major epidemics (including the COVID pandemic) and government and industry responses to epidemics such as travel restrictions and extended shut down of businesses.

Uncertainties related to the magnitude and duration of the COVID pandemic may significantly adversely affect John Deere&#8217;s and the Company&#8217;s business and outlook. These uncertainties include: the duration and impact of the resurgence in COVID cases in any country, state, or region; prolonged reduction or closure of John Deere&#8217;s and the Company&#8217;s operations, or a delayed recovery in our operations; increased risk of cyber attacks on network connections used in remote working arrangements; increased privacy-related risks due to processing health-related personal information; additional closures as mandated or otherwise made necessary by governmental authorities; absence of employees due to illness; the impact of the pandemic on the financial condition and credit risk of the Company&#8217;s customers and dealers, which could affect the demand for financing and lead to higher credit losses and losses on lease residual 

values; requests by the Company&#8217;s customers or dealers for payment deferrals and contract modifications; the impact of disruptions in the global capital markets and/or continued declines in John Deere&#8217;s and the Company&#8217;s financial performance, outlook or credit ratings, which could impact John Deere&#8217;s and the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain funding in the future; and the impact of the pandemic on demand for John Deere&#8217;s products and services. It is unclear when a sustained economic recovery could occur and what a recovery may look like. All of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial position.

Significant changes in market liquidity conditions, changes in the Company&#8217;s credit ratings, and any failure to comply with financial covenants in credit agreements could impact access to funding and funding costs, which could reduce the Company&#8217;s earnings and cash flows. Financial market conditions could also negatively impact customer access to capital for purchases of John Deere&#8217;s products and customer confidence and purchase decisions, borrowing and repayment practices, and the number and size of customer loan delinquencies and defaults. A debt crisis, in Europe or elsewhere, could negatively impact currencies, global financial markets, social and political stability, funding sources and costs, asset and obligation values, customers, and Company operations and results. Security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, technology failures, and other disruptions to the Company&#8217;s information technology infrastructure also could materially affect results. The Company&#8217;s operations could be impaired by changes in the equity, bond, and other financial markets, which would negatively affect earnings.

The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and elsewhere. The economic conditions and outlook could be further adversely affected by (i) uncertainty regarding any new or modified trade arrangements between the United Kingdom and the European Union and/or other countries, (ii) the risk that one or more other European Union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the European Union, or (iii) the risk that the euro as the single currency of the Eurozone could cease to exist. Any of these developments, or the perception that any of these developments are likely to occur, could affect economic growth or business activity in the United Kingdom or the European Union, and could result in the relocation of businesses, cause business interruptions, lead to economic recession or depression, and impact the stability of the financial markets, availability of credit, currency exchange rates, interest rates, financial institutions, and political, financial and monetary systems. Any of these developments could affect our businesses, liquidity, results of operations and financial position.

The liquidity and ongoing profitability of the Company depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements, and to fund operations, costs, and purchases of John Deere&#8217;s products. If general economic conditions deteriorate or capital markets become more volatile, including as a result of the COVID pandemic, funding could be unavailable or insufficient. Additionally, customer confidence levels may result in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the Company&#8217;s write-offs and provision for credit losses.

In addition, the Company&#8217;s business is closely related to John Deere&#8217;s business. Further information, including factors that could materially affect the Company&#8217;s and John Deere&#8217;s financial results, is included in the most recent Deere &#38; Company Form 10-K (including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Form 10-K) and other Deere &#38; Company and Capital Corporation quarterly and other filings with the SEC.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

##TABLE_END &#8203; 

* &#160; Principal payments. 

**&#8194;&#8194;&#8197;&#8194; &#8197;&#8197;&#8197; &#8194;Payments related to securitization borrowings of $4,661.3 million classified as short-term on the balance sheet related to the securitization of retail notes are included in this table based on the expected payment schedule (See Note 9). 

*** &#160; Includes projected payments related to interest rate swaps. 

The previous table does not include unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of approximately $33.3 million at November 1, 2020 since the timing of future payments is not reasonably estimable at this time (See Note 15). It also does not include unused commitments to extend credit to customers and John Deere dealers as discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information regarding short-term borrowings and long-term borrowings, see Notes 9 and 10, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on the financial statements. The accounting policies below are those management believes are the most critical to the preparation of the Company&#8217;s financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. The Company&#8217;s other accounting policies are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of the losses inherent in the Company&#8217;s Receivable portfolio. The level of the allowance is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical net loss experience by product category, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions in the Company&#8217;s major markets and geographies, commodity price trends, and credit risk quality. The Company has an established process to calculate a range of possible outcomes and determine the adequacy of the allowance. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly by product category. Different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses. 

The total allowance for credit losses at November 1, 2020, November 3, 2019, and October 28, 2018 was $129.1 million, $100.6 million, and $106.7 million, respectively. The allowance increase in 2020 was primarily due to the negative economic effects related to COVID and other macroeconomic issues, which have significantly affected certain retail borrowers, particularly of construction equipment (See Note 5). The allowance decreased in 2019 due primarily to decreases in loss experience.

The assumptions used in evaluating the Company&#8217;s exposure to credit losses involve estimates and significant judgment. The historical loss experience on the Receivable portfolios represents one factor used in determining the allowance for credit losses. Compared to the average loss experience over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average of approximately plus or minus .03 percent. Holding other factors constant, if this estimated loss experience on the Receivable portfolio were to increase or decrease .03 percent, the allowance for credit losses at November 1, 2020 would increase or decrease by approximately $9.9 million.

Operating Lease Residual Values 

The carrying value of the equipment on operating leases is affected by the estimated fair values of the equipment at the end of the lease (residual values). Upon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third party, in which case the Company may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale price. The estimated residual values are based on several factors, including lease term, expected hours of usage, historical wholesale sales prices, return experience, intended equipment use, market dynamics and trends, and dealer residual guarantees. The Company reviews residual value estimates during the lease term and tests carrying value of its operating leases when events or circumstances necessitate. Changes in residual value assumptions would affect the amount of depreciation expense and the amount of investment in equipment on operating leases. The total operating lease residual values at November 1, 2020, November 3, 2019, and October 28, 2018 were $3,826.3 million, and $3,876.5 million, and $3,740.9 million, respectively. 

Estimates used in determining end of lease market values for equipment on operating leases significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense. Hypothetically, if future market values for this equipment were to decrease 10 percent from the Company&#8217;s present estimates, the total impact would be to increase the Company&#8217;s annual depreciation for equipment on operating leases by approximately $131.2 million.
