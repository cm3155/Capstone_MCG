The Company 

John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation) and its subsidiaries are collectively called the Company. John Deere Financial Services, Inc. (JDFS), a wholly-owned finance holding subsidiary of Deere &#38; Company, owns all of the outstanding common stock of Capital Corporation. See &#8220;Relationships of the Company with John Deere&#8221; for additional information regarding agreements between the Company and Deere &#38; Company. The Company conducts business in Australia, New Zealand, the United States (U.S.), and in several countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Capital Corporation was incorporated under the laws of Delaware and commenced operations in 1958.

The Company provides and administers financing for retail purchases of new equipment manufactured by Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s agriculture and turf and construction and forestry operations and used equipment taken in trade for this equipment. The Company generally purchases retail installment sales and loan contracts (retail notes) from Deere &#38; Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively called John Deere). John Deere generally acquires these retail notes through John Deere retail dealers. The Company also purchases and finances a limited amount of non-Deere retail notes. The Company also finances and services revolving charge accounts, in most cases acquired from and offered through merchants in the agriculture and turf and construction and forestry markets (revolving charge accounts). The Company also provides wholesale financing for inventories of John Deere agriculture and turf and construction and forestry equipment owned by dealers of those products (wholesale receivables). In addition, the Company leases John Deere equipment and a limited amount of non-Deere equipment to retail customers (financing and operating leases). The Company also offers credit enhanced international export financing to select customers and dealers, which generally involves John Deere products. Retail notes, revolving charge accounts, wholesale receivables, and financing leases are collectively called &#8220;Receivables.&#8221; Receivables and equipment on operating leases are collectively called &#8220;Receivables and Leases.&#8221;

Business of John Deere 

John Deere&#8217;s operations are categorized into three major business segments:

The agriculture and turf segment primarily manufactures and distributes a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service parts, including: large, medium, and utility tractors; tractor loaders; combines, cotton pickers, cotton strippers, and sugarcane harvesters; harvesting front-end equipment; sugarcane loaders and pull-behind scrapers; tillage, seeding and application equipment, including sprayers, nutrient management and soil preparation machinery; hay and forage equipment, including self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers and mowers; turf and utility equipment, including riding lawn equipment, golf course equipment, utility vehicles, and commercial mowing equipment, along with a broad line of associated implements; integrated agricultural solutions and precision technologies; and other outdoor power products.

The construction and forestry segment primarily manufactures and distributes a broad range of machines and service parts used in construction, earthmoving, roadbuilding, material handling and timber harvesting, including: backhoe 

loaders; crawler dozers and loaders; four-wheel-drive loaders; excavators; motor graders; articulated dump trucks; landscape loaders; skid-steer loaders; milling machines; recyclers; slipform pavers; surface miners; asphalt pavers; compactors; tandem and static rollers; mobile crushers and screens; mobile and stationary asphalt plants; log skidders; feller bunchers; log loaders; log forwarders; log harvesters and related logging attachments; and precision technologies.

John Deere&#8217;s worldwide agriculture and turf and construction and forestry operations are sometimes collectively referred to as the &#8220;Equipment Operations.&#8221; The products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets, and, as it relates to roadbuilding products, primarily through John Deere-owned sales and service subsidiaries.

The financial services segment includes the operations of the Company (described herein), and additional operations in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, China, India, Russia, and Thailand. The segment primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, it provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, finances retail revolving charge accounts, and offers extended equipment warranties.

For fiscal 2020, worldwide net income attributable to Deere &#38; Company was $2.751 billion, or $8.69 per share, compared with $3.253 billion, or $10.15 per share, in 2019. 

John Deere&#8217;s net sales and revenues decreased 9 percent to $35.540 billion in 2020, compared with $39.258 billion in 2019. Net sales of Equipment Operations decreased in fiscal 2020 to $31.272 billion, compared with $34.886 billion last year. 

Agriculture &#38; turf sales decreased in 2020 due to lower shipment volumes and the unfavorable effects of currency translation, partially offset by price realization. Construction &#38; forestry sales decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower shipment volumes and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by price realization. 

The financial services operations reported net income of $566 million for fiscal 2020 compared with $539 million in fiscal 2019. The increase was mainly due to lower impairments and reduced losses on operating lease residual values and income earned on a higher average portfolio, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses, employee-separation expenses, and unfavorable financing spreads.

Market Conditions 

Agriculture &#38; Turf. Industry sales of agricultural equipment in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to increase 5 to 10 percent, driven by gains in larger models. Full year industry sales in Europe are forecast to be about the same as 2020 to 5 percent higher. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are forecast to be about 5 percent higher while Asian sales are expected to be slightly lower than 2020. Industry sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be about the same to 5 percent higher for 2021.

Construction &#38; Forestry. Full year 2021 North American construction equipment industry sales are expected to be down about 5 percent with sales of compact equipment up about 5 percent. Global forestry industry sales are forecast to be about the same to 5 percent higher in 2021. 

Financial Services. Results for the full year 2021 are expected to benefit from favorable financing spreads, lower losses on operating lease residual values, and income earned on a higher average portfolio, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses.

Relationships of the Company with John Deere 

The results of operations of the Company are affected by its relationships with John Deere, including, among other items, the terms on which the Company acquires Receivables and Leases and borrows funds from John Deere, the reimbursement for interest waiver and low-rate finance programs from John Deere, the compensation paid by John Deere in connection with the Company&#8217;s purchase of trade receivables from John Deere, and the payment to John Deere for various expenses applicable to the Company&#8217;s operations. In addition, the Company and John Deere have joint access to certain lines of credit.

The Company&#8217;s acquisition volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products. The level of John Deere retail sales and leases is responsive to a variety of economic, financial, climatic, legislative, and other factors that influence demand for its products. The majority of the Company&#8217;s businesses are affected by changes in interest rates, demand for credit, and competition.

The Company bears substantially all of the credit risk (net of recovery from withholdings from certain John Deere dealers and merchants) associated with its holding of Receivables and Leases. A small portion of the Receivables and Leases held (less than 5 percent) is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of Deere &#38; Company. The Company also performs substantially all servicing and collection functions. Servicing and collection functions for a small portion of the Receivables and Leases held (less than 5 percent) are provided by John Deere. John Deere is reimbursed for staff and other administrative services at estimated cost and for credit lines provided to the Company based on utilization of those lines.

The terms and the basis on which the Company acquires retail notes and certain wholesale receivables from John Deere are governed by agreements with John Deere, generally terminable by either John Deere or the Company on 30 days notice. As provided in these agreements, the Company agrees to the terms and conditions for purchasing the retail notes and wholesale receivables from John Deere. Under these agreements, John Deere is not obligated to sell notes to the Company, and the Company is obligated to purchase notes from John Deere only if the notes comply with the terms and conditions set by the Company.

The basis on which John Deere acquires retail notes and wholesale receivables from the dealers is governed by agreements with the John Deere dealers, which may be terminated in accordance with their terms and applicable law. In acquiring these notes from dealers, the terms and conditions, as set forth in agreements with the dealers, conform with the terms and conditions adopted by the Company in determining the acceptability of retail and certain wholesale notes to be purchased from John Deere. The dealers are not obligated to sell these notes to John Deere and John Deere is not obligated to accept these notes from the dealers. In practice, retail and wholesale notes are acquired from dealers only if the terms of these notes and the creditworthiness of the customers are acceptable to the Company. The Company acts on behalf of both itself and John Deere in determining the acceptability of the notes and in acquiring acceptable notes from dealers.

The basis on which the Company enters into leases with retail customers through John Deere dealers is governed by agreements between dealers and the Company. Leases are accepted based on the terms and conditions, the lessees&#8217; creditworthiness, the anticipated residual values of the equipment, and the intended uses of the equipment.

Deere &#38; Company has an agreement with Capital Corporation pursuant to which it has agreed to continue to own, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to maintain the Company&#8217;s consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50.0 million. This agreement also obligates Deere &#38; Company to make payments to the Company such that its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter. Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s obligations to make payments to the Company under the agreement are independent of whether the Company is in default on its indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Further, Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of the Company&#8217;s indebtedness, obligations, or other liabilities. Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation, or liability of the Company and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. No payments were required under this agreement during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.

The Company purchases certain wholesale trade receivables from John Deere. These trade receivables arise from John Deere&#8217;s sales of goods to independent dealers. Under the terms of the sales to dealers, interest is primarily charged to dealers on outstanding balances, from the earlier of the date when goods are sold to retail customers by the dealer or the expiration of certain interest-free periods granted at the time of the sale to the dealer, until payment is received by the Company. Dealers cannot cancel purchases after John Deere recognizes a sale and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to retail customers. The interest-free periods are determined based on the type of equipment sold and the time of year of the sale. These periods range from one to twelve months for most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be extended. Interest charged may not be forgiven and the past due interest rates exceed market rates. The Company receives compensation from John Deere at approximate market interest rates for these interest-free periods. The Company computes the compensation from John Deere for interest-free periods based on the Company&#8217;s estimated funding costs, administrative and operating expenses, credit losses, and required return on equity.

Description of Receivables and Leases 

Receivables and Leases arise mainly from retail and wholesale sales and leases of John Deere products and used equipment accepted in trade for them, and from retail sales of equipment of unrelated manufacturers. Receivables and Leases also include revolving charge accounts receivable. At November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019, at least 90 percent of the Receivables and Leases administered by the Company were for financing that facilitated the purchase or lease of John Deere products.

John Deere Financial, f.s.b. (Thrift), is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Capital Corporation. It holds a federal thrift charter and is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The U.S. Federal Reserve Board has oversight of the Company, as the owner of the Thrift. The Thrift is headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin and offers revolving charge products including John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account, PowerPlan &#226; , and John Deere Financial Revolving Plan throughout the U.S. The John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account is used by farmers and ranchers to finance their purchase of production inputs from agribusiness merchants, including seed, fertilizer, and crop protection. The John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account is also used by agriculture and turf customers to finance the purchase of parts and service from John Deere dealers. The PowerPlan &#226; revolving charge account is primarily used by construction and forestry customers to finance the purchase of equipment parts, equipment rentals, and service work performed at John Deere construction and forestry dealers. John Deere Financial Revolving Plan is used primarily by retail customers of John Deere dealers to finance purchases of turf and utility equipment. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under &#8220;Revolving Charge Accounts Receivable.&#8221;

The Company finances wholesale inventories of John Deere agriculture and turf and construction and forestry equipment. A large portion of the wholesale financing is provided by the Company to dealers from whom it also purchases agriculture and turf and construction and forestry retail notes. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under &#8220;Wholesale Receivables.&#8221;

The Company generally requires that theft and physical damage insurance be carried on all goods leased or securing retail notes and wholesale receivables. In certain markets, the customer may, at the customer&#8217;s own expense, have the Company or the seller of the goods purchase this insurance or obtain it from other sources. Insurance is not required for goods purchased under revolving charge accounts.

Receivables and Leases are eligible for acceptance if they conform to prescribed finance and lease plan terms. Guidelines relating to down payments and contract terms on retail notes and leases are described in Note 4 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In limited circumstances, Receivables and Leases may be accepted and acquired even though they do not conform in all respects to the established guidelines. The Company determines whether Receivables and Leases should be accepted and how they should be serviced. Acceptance of these Receivables and Leases is dependent on having one or more risk mitigation enhancements that may include the pledge of additional collateral as security, the assignment of specific earnings to the Company, or the acceptance of accelerated payment schedules. Officers of the Company are responsible for establishing policies and reviewing the performance of the Company in accepting and collecting Receivables and Leases. The Company normally makes all of its own routine collections, settlements, and repossessions on Receivables and Leases.

John Deere retail notes and wholesale receivables are generally supported by perfected security interests in goods financed under laws such as the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), certain federal statutes, and state motor vehicle laws in the U.S. and by security in goods or other security under applicable laws in other countries and jurisdictions. UCC financing statements are also prepared and filed on leases; however, these filings for operating leases are made for informational purposes only.

Finance Rates on Retail Notes 

As of November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019, approximately 95 percent of the retail notes held by the Company bore a fixed finance rate. A portion of the finance income earned by the Company arises from reimbursements from John Deere in connection with financing the retail sales of John Deere equipment on which finance charges are waived or 

reduced by John Deere for a period from the date of sale to a specified subsequent date. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Average Original Term and Average Actual Life of Retail Notes and Leases 

Due to prepayments (often from trade-ins and refinancing), the average actual life of retail notes and leases is considerably shorter than the average original term. The following table shows the average original term for retail notes and leases acquired and the average actual life for retail notes and leases liquidated (in months):

##TABLE_END The Company provided short-term relief to dealers and retail customers during 2020 due to the economic effects of COVID-19 (COVID). The delinquency status of Receivables granted relief due to COVID is based on the modified payment schedule (See Note 5). During the first quarter of 2019, the Company amended the timing in which finance income and lease revenue is generally suspended on retail notes, revolving charge accounts, and finance lease accounts from 120 days delinquent to 90 days delinquent. This change in estimate was made on a prospective basis and did not have a significant effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management&#8217;s methodology to determine the collectability of delinquent accounts was not affected by the change.

##TABLE_END The increase in the allowance for credit losses on construction and forestry retail notes during 2020 was primarily due to the negative economic effects related to COVID and other macroeconomic issues, which significantly affected certain retail borrowers, particularly of construction equipment. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

##TABLE_END &#8203; 

The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in the Company&#8217;s Receivable portfolio. The level of the allowance is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical net loss experience by product category, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions in the Company&#8217;s major markets and geographies, commodity price trends, and credit risk quality. The Company has an established process to calculate a range of possible outcomes and determine the adequacy of the allowance. Historical Receivable recoveries and write-offs are considered as part of the loss experience by product category. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly by product category. Different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses.

The allowance is determined at an aggregate level by product category for all Receivables that are performing in accordance with payment terms and are not materially past due. The Company assigns loss factors to each aggregation and loss factors are applied to the applicable Receivable balance to determine the allowance level for each product category. The loss factors are determined based on quantitative and qualitative factors as described above.

The Company also reviews Receivables for impairment based on delinquencies and changes in cash flows or collateral. These Receivables consist of materially past due Receivables, customers that have provided bankruptcy notification, and other Receivables requiring significant collection efforts, including litigation. The Company identifies these Receivables during reviews of portfolio credit quality. The Company includes the impairment on non-performing Receivables as a separate component in the allowance unless it has already been recognized as a loss.

The total allowance reflects management&#8217;s estimate of credit losses inherent in the Receivable portfolio at the balance sheet date. See further discussion of the allowance for credit losses in the Critical Accounting Policies.

Competition 

The businesses in which the Company is engaged are highly competitive. The Company competes for customers with commercial banks and finance and leasing companies based upon its service, finance rates charged, and other finance terms. The proportion of John Deere equipment retail sales and leases financed by the Company is influenced by conditions prevailing in the agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment industries, in the financial markets, and in business generally. The Company financed a significant portion of John Deere equipment retail sales and leases in many of the countries in which the Company operated during 2020 and 2019.

The Company emphasizes convenient service to customers and endeavors to offer terms desired in its specialized markets, such as seasonal schedules of repayment and rentals. The Company&#8217;s retail finance rates and lease rates are generally believed to be in the range offered by other sales finance and leasing companies, although not as low as those of some banks and other lenders and lessors.

Regulation 

In several U.S. states, state law limits the maximum finance rate on receivables. The present state limitations have not, thus far, significantly limited variable-rate finance charges or the fixed-rate finance charges established by the Company. However, if interest rate levels should increase significantly, maximum state rates could affect the Company by preventing the variable rates on outstanding variable-rate retail notes from increasing above the maximum state rate and by limiting the fixed rates on new notes. In some states, the Company may be able to qualify new retail notes for a higher maximum rate limit by using retail installment sales contracts (rather than loan contracts) or by using fixed-rate rather than variable-rate contracts.

In addition to rate regulation, various U.S. state and federal laws and regulations apply to some Receivables and Leases, principally retail notes for goods sold for personal, family, or household use and John Deere Financial Revolving Plan, John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account, and PowerPlan &#226; accounts receivable. To date, these laws and regulations have not had a significant adverse effect on the Company.

The Thrift holds a federal thrift charter and is subject to regulation and examination by the OCC. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board has oversight of the Company, as the owner of the Thrift.

The manner in which the Company offers financing outside the U.S. is affected by a variety of country specific laws, regulations, and customs, including those governing property rights and debtor obligations, that are subject to change and that may introduce greater risk to the Company.

In fiscal 2020, compliance with the regulations applicable to the Company did not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. The Company does not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during fiscal 2021. Additional information about the impact of government regulations on the Company&#39;s business is included in Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; under the headings Geopolitical Uncertainties; Data Security and Privacy; Environmental, Climate and Weather Risks; and Bribery and Corruption Risks. 

Human Capital 

The Company&#8217;s employees, its human capital, are guided by John Deere&#8217;s higher purpose: We run so life can leap forward. The employees are further guided by John Deere&#8217;s code of business conduct, helping them to uphold and strengthen the standards of honor and integrity that have defined John Deere since its founding. In their everyday work, employees embody John Deere&#8217;s core values of integrity, quality, commitment and innovation, and in doing so, directly contribute to John Deere&#8217;s long-standing character and reputation.

Employees take pride in their work and value learning from one another. While they hold many values in common, the Company&#8217;s employees appreciate different perspectives and embrace the opportunity to work with those of diverse backgrounds. The Company encourages employees to become involved in their communities and many employees do contribute their time and talents to community efforts. The Company&#8217;s employees contribute to its efforts to provide a safe and healthy workplace for all, especially through 2020. At November 1, 2020, the Company had 1,498 full-time and part-time employees.
