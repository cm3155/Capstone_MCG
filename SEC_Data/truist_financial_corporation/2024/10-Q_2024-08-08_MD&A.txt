 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

MD&#38;A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, other information contained in this document, as well as with Truist&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. A description of certain factors that may affect our future results and risk factors is set forth in Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Regulatory and Supervisory Considerations 

We are subject to significant regulatory frameworks that affect the products and services that we may offer and the manner in which we may offer them, the risks that we may take, the ways in which we may operate, and the corporate and financial actions that we may take. We are also subject to direct supervision and periodic examinations by various governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations that are charged with overseeing the kinds of business activities in which we engage. The regulatory and supervisory framework applicable to banking organizations is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other customers, the DIF, the broader economy, and the stability of the U.S. financial system, rather than for the protection of shareholders and non-deposit creditors. In addition to banking laws and regulations, Truist is subject to various other laws and regulations, all of which directly or indirectly affect the operations and management of Truist and its ability to make distributions to shareholders. The descriptions below summarize certain updates to significant federal and state laws to which Truist is subject since the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These descriptions do not summarize all possible or proposed changes in laws or regulations and are not intended to be a substitute for the related statutes or regulatory provisions. Refer to &#8220;Regulatory and Supervisory Considerations&#8221; in Truist&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional disclosures. 

In November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement a special assessment to recoup losses to the DIF associated with bank failures in the first half of 2023. The assessment is based on an insured depository institution&#8217;s estimated uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022. The special assessment for Truist is $595 million, with $507 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 and additional adjustments of $75 million and $13 million recognized in the first and second quarters of 2024, respectively, due to increases in the estimated relevant losses to the DIF reported by the FDIC. In June 2024, the FDIC provided notification that the collection period will be extended an additional two quarters beyond the initial eight quarterly installments. The special assessment will be paid in ten quarterly installments beginning in the second quarter of 2024. The ultimate amount of expenses associated with the special assessment will also be impacted by the finalization of the losses incurred by the FDIC in the resolutions of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which could result in additional expense. 

In March 2024, the FDIC released proposed revisions to its statement of policy on bank merger transactions. The proposal reflects regulatory, legislative, and industry changes since the statement of policy was last published for comment and amended, makes the statement more principles-based, communicates the FDIC Board&#8217;s expectations regarding the evaluation of merger applications filed under the Bank Merger Act, and describes the types of merger applications for which the FDIC is the responsible agency. Also, in July 2024, the FDIC released a proposed rule to amend its regulations under the Change in Bank Control Act, which generally provides that no person may directly or indirectly acquire control of an insured depository institution unless the person has given the appropriate federal banking agency prior notice of the proposed transaction and the agency has not disapproved it. The FDIC&#8217;s regulations contain a rebuttable presumption that the acquisition of voting securities of a holding company like Truist that directly or indirectly controls an insured state nonmember bank like Truist Bank constitutes such an acquisition of control requiring prior notice to the FDIC if, immediately after the transaction, the acquiring person will own, control, or hold with power to vote 10 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the holding company and other specified conditions are met. The proposed rule removes an explicit exemption for transactions where the FRB reviews a notice under the Change in Bank Control Act. In addition, the FDIC seeks information and comment about its approach in response to these notices, including the role played by asset managers and other institutional investors with FDIC-supervised institutions. We continue to evaluate both proposals and the potential impacts, if adopted as proposed, on the Company and Truist Bank. 

The FRB&#8217;s capital plan rule provides that a BHC must update and resubmit its capital plan if the BHC determines there has been or will be a material change in its risk profile, financial condition, or corporate structure since it last submitted the capital plan. Truist determined that the sale of our remaining equity interests in TIH constituted such a material change and, therefore, addressed the material change in our capital plan submitted in April 2024. The capital plan rule further provides that, upon the occurrence of an event requiring resubmission and pending the FRB&#8217;s consideration of the resubmitted capital plan, a BHC may not make any capital distribution unless it has received prior approval of the FRB. In July 2024, the FRB notified Truist that the FRB&#8217;s prior approval was no longer required to make capital distributions in connection with the April 2024 capital plan.

In June 2024, the FDIC adopted a final rule to significantly modify the required frequency and informational content of resolution plan submissions applicable to insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets. As a covered insured depository institution in group A under the rule, Truist Bank must develop an identified strategy for its resolution that is adaptable across a range of possible failure scenarios. The rule also introduces a new credibility standard for evaluating the adequacy of resolution plan submissions. The contours of the FDIC&#8217;s application of this new credibility standard remain to be seen and may require the exercise of a meaningful degree of judgment by the FDIC. A failure by Truist Bank to satisfy the credibility standard, or any other provision of the rule, may cause the FDIC to require Truist Bank to reconsider portions of its resolution plan or result in an enforcement action by the FDIC. Truist Bank will be required to submit to the FDIC full resolution plans every three years and interim targeted information between full resolution plan submissions. The final rule is effective October 1, 2024, and the first full resolution plan submission by Truist Bank will be due no sooner than 270 days after the effective date. 

In August 2024, the FDIC and the FRB issued final joint guidance regarding resolution plans submitted by large bank holding companies. Truist, as a domestic triennial full filer under the rule, is required to submit a resolution plan every three years, beginning on October 1, 2025, which reflects the characteristics of the firm and its business operations and supports the goal of substantially mitigating serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States in the event of the firm&#8217;s failure. The agencies have not yet finalized a rule requiring large bank holding companies to issue long-term debt that would serve as pre-positioned resolution resources in the event of a firm&#8217;s failure. The long-term debt rule, when finalized, may have an impact on Truist&#8217;s resolution plan strategy which may result in revisions to its resolution plan submission. 

Executive Overview 

In the second quarter, we continued to see solid momentum in our core banking businesses as evidenced by strong year-over-year growth in investment banking and trading revenue and continued expense discipline. Client deposits stabilized, and asset quality metrics remained within our expectations. While loan demand remained muted, we were encouraged by an improvement in our dialogue with clients and our expanded capacity to support their needs. 

On May 6, 2024, we completed the divestiture of TIH. We utilized a portion of the capital created from the sale of TIH to reposition our balance sheet, which is expected to replace TIH&#8217;s earnings contribution, create additional liquidity, and improve our interest rate risk profile. These actions along with organic capital generation resulted in an increase to our CET1 capital ratio to 11.6%. Financial information attributed to TIH has been reflected in discontinued operations for the periods presented within and, unless otherwise stated, the following discussion excludes amounts reported as discontinued operations. Refer to &#8220;Note 2. Discontinued Operations&#8221; for additional information. 

The sale of TIH resulted in after-tax cash proceeds to Truist of approximately $10.1 billion, reflecting certain closing adjustments for cash, debt and debt-like items, including the settlement of certain previously granted TIH equity awards, working capital, transaction expenses and an investor return amount associated with the originally sold 20% stake. Upon closing, the transaction resulted in the deconsolidation of the TIH subsidiary from Truist and resulted in an approximate after-tax gain of $4.8 billion. Additionally, following the sale, Truist retained the related postretirement benefit obligation for TIH employees, and remeasured the postretirement benefit obligation of the plan in the second quarter of 2024. Refer to &#8220;Note 2. Discontinued Operations&#8221; for additional information related to discontinued operations and &#8220;Note 13. Benefit Plans&#8221; for additional information related to the postretirement benefit obligation remeasurement. 

Following the sale of TIH, Truist executed a strategic balance sheet repositioning of a portion of its AFS investment securities portfolio by selling $27.7 billion of lower-yielding investment securities, resulting in an after-tax loss of $5.1 billion in the second quarter of 2024. The investment securities that were sold had a book value of $34.4 billion and a weighted average book yield of 2.80% for the remainder of 2024 including the impact of hedges and based on the Federal Funds futures curve at the time. Including the tax benefit, the repositioning generated $29.3 billion available for reinvestment. 

Truist invested approximately $18.7 billion of the $39.4 billion generated from the sale of TIH and the balance sheet repositioning in shorter duration investment securities yielding 5.27%. The remaining $20.7 billion was invested in cash. The blended reinvestment rate on the new investment securities purchased and cash is 5.22% for the remainder of 2024 including the impact of hedges and based on the Federal Funds futures curve at the time. 

Our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2024 through the end of 2026. The most recent FRB stress test highlighted our ability to weather a variety of stressed economic scenarios. 

We believe that Truist's strengthened capital position offers us the opportunity to grow our core banking franchise, while also prudently returning capital to our shareholders through our strong dividend and recently announced share repurchase program.

Following the departure of our CIO in April 2024, we have appointed an interim CIO while our search for a permanent CIO continues. Our interim CIO has 20 years of banking experience across risk management, commercial, consumer, operations, technology, and vertically integrated businesses. He oversees the provision of comprehensive technology, data, security, and information related platforms. 

In August 2024, the Company announced the hiring of a new CIO who will join the Company in the fourth quarter of 2024 and will lead the enterprise technology team. The new CIO has over 25 years of experience across a range of technology roles, primarily in the financial services industry. 

In July 2024, we successfully completed the sale of Sterling Capital Management LLC, a Wealth business. Cash proceeds and the initial gain recognized on the sale were not material. 

Financial Results 

Net income available to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2024 of $826 million was down 33% compared with the second quarter of 2023. On a diluted per common share basis, earnings for the second quarter of 2024 were $0.62, a decrease of $0.30, or 33%, compared to the second quarter of 2023. Truist&#8217;s results of operations for the second quarter of 2024 produced an annualized return on average assets of 0.70% and an annualized return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity of 6.1% compared to prior year returns of 0.95% and 8.6%, respectively. 

Net loss from continuing operations was $3.9 billion for the second quarter of 2024, compared to net income of $1.2 billion for the second quarter of 2023. 

&#8226; Results from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2024 included securities losses of $6.7 billion ($5.1 billion after-tax, or $3.80 per share), from the strategic balance sheet repositioning of a portion of the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio, a charitable contribution to the Truist Foundation of $150 million ($115 million after-tax, or $0.09 per share), and restructuring charges of $33 million ($26 million after-tax, or $0.02 per share). 

&#8226; Results from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2023 included restructuring charges of $48 million ($37 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share). 

Net income from discontinued operations was $4.8 billion for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $176 million for the second quarter of 2023. 

&#8226; Results from discontinued operations for the second quarter of 2024 included a gain on the sale of TIH of $6.9 billion ($4.8 billion after-tax, or $3.60 per share), and restructuring charges of $63 million ($47 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share). 

Taxable-equivalent net interest income for the second quarter of 2024 was down $77 million, or 2.1%, compared to the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher funding costs and lower earning assets, partially offset by the balance sheet repositioning. Net interest margin was 3.03%, up 13 basis points. 

&#8226; The yield on the average total loan portfolio was 6.44%, up 37 basis points, reflecting higher market interest rates, and the yield on the average securities portfolio was 2.77%, up 60 basis points, reflecting the balance sheet repositioning and higher market interest rates. 

&#8226; The average cost of total deposits was 2.09%, up 56 basis points. The average cost of short-term borrowings was 5.58%, up 39 basis points. The average cost of long-term debt was 4.87%, up 25 basis points. The increase in rates on deposits and other funding sources was largely attributable to the higher rate environment. 

Noninterest income was down $6.6 billion compared to the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to $6.7 billion of securities losses resulting from the balance sheet repositioning and lower other income, partially offset by higher investment banking and trading income and wealth management income. Excluding securities losses, noninterest income was up $58 million compared to the second quarter of 2023. 

Noninterest expense was up $48 million, or 1.6%, compared to the second quarter of 2023 due to a $150 million charitable contribution to the Truist Foundation (other expense) and the FDIC special assessment adjustment in the second quarter of 2024 of $13 million (regulatory costs), partially offset by lower personnel expense. Adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes the charitable contribution, the FDIC special assessment adjustment, restructuring charges, the amortization of intangibles, and a small loss on the early extinguishment of debt in 2023, decreased $86 million, or 3.0%, compared to the earlier quarter. 

The higher effective tax rate in the current quarter compared to the second quarter of 2023 is due to a tax benefit on the pre-tax loss, which is driven by the discrete impact of the balance sheet repositioning of securities.

Asset quality remained solid during the second quarter of 2024. 

&#8226; Nonperforming loans and leases held for investment were 0.46% of loans and leases held for investment at June 30, 2024, up one basis point compared to March 31, 2024. 

&#8226; The allowance for credit losses was $5.1 billion and includes $4.8 billion for the allowance for loan and lease losses and $302 million for the reserve for unfunded commitments. The ALLL ratio was 1.57%, up one basis point compared with March 31, 2024. 

&#8226; The provision for credit losses was $451 million compared to $538 million for the second quarter of 2023 primarily reflecting a lower allowance build. 

&#8226; The net charge-off ratio was 58 basis points, up 4 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2023 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs in the CRE, other consumer, indirect auto, and credit card portfolios, partially offset by lower net charge-offs in the commercial and industrial portfolio. Additionally, the second quarter of 2023 included $98 million of charge-offs related to the sale of the student loan portfolio. 

Capital ratios were significantly strengthened during the second quarter of 2024. 

&#8226; Truist&#8217;s CET1 ratio was 11.6% as of June 30, 2024, up 150 basis points compared to March 31, 2024 due to the sale of TIH and organic capital generation, partially offset by the balance sheet repositioning. 

&#8226; Truist's board of directors authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program beginning in the third quarter of 2024 through 2026 as part of the Company's overall capital distribution strategy. 

&#8226; Truist completed the 2024 CCAR process and received a preliminary SCB requirement of 2.8% for the period October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025, down 10 basis points from the SCB requirement for the period October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The Federal Reserve will provide Truist with its final SCB requirement by August 31, 2024. 

&#8226; Truist declared common dividends of $0.52 per share during the second quarter of 2024. The dividend payout ratio for the second quarter of 2024 was 85%. Truist did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter of 2024. 

&#8226; Truist&#8217;s average consolidated LCR was 110% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the regulatory minimum of 100%. 

Analysis of Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income and NIM 

Taxable-equivalent net interest income for the second quarter of 2024 was down $77 million, or 2.1%, compared to the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher funding costs and lower earning assets, partially offset by the balance sheet repositioning. Net interest margin was 3.03%, up 13 basis points. 

&#8226; Average earning assets decreased $32.0 billion, or 6.3%, primarily due to declines in average total loans of $20.7 billion, or 6.3%, and a decrease in average securities of $17.1 billion, or 12%, partially offset by growth in other earning assets of $4.6 billion, or 13%. The change in average securities was driven by maturities and the balance sheet repositioning and change in other earning assets (increase in balances held at the Federal Reserve) was driven by the balance sheet repositioning. 

&#8226; The yield on the average total loan portfolio was 6.44%, up 37 basis points, reflecting higher market interest rates, and the yield on the average securities portfolio was 2.77%, up 60 basis points, reflecting the balance sheet repositioning and higher market interest rates. 

&#8226; Average deposits decreased $11.8 billion, or 2.9%, average short-term borrowings increased $2.0 billion, or 8.4%, and average long-term debt decreased $26.9 billion, or 42%.

The average cost of long-term debt was 4.87%, up 25 basis points. The increase in rates on deposits and other funding sources was largely attributable to the higher rate environment. 

52 Truist Financial Corporation 

Taxable-equivalent net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was down $570 million, or 7.5%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to higher funding costs and lower earning assets, partially offset by the balance sheet repositioning. Net interest margin was 2.96%, down seven basis points compared to the prior period. 

&#8226; Average earning assets decreased $27.3 billion, or 5.4%, compared to the prior period primarily due to declines in average total loans of $19.4 billion, or 5.9%, and average securities of $13.2 billion, or 9.4%, partially offset by an increase in other earning assets of $5.0 billion, or 17%. The change in average securities was driven by maturities and the balance sheet repositioning and change in other earning assets (increase in balances held at the Federal Reserve) was driven by the balance sheet repositioning. 

&#8226; The yield on the average total loan portfolio was 6.41% for 2024, up 47 basis points, compared to the prior period primarily reflecting higher market interest rates. The yield on the average securities portfolio was 2.61% for 2024, up 45 basis points compared to the prior period, reflecting the balance sheet repositioning and higher market interest rates. 

&#8226; Average deposits decreased $15.6 billion, or 3.9%, average short-term borrowings increased $2.1 billion, or 9%, and average long-term debt decreased $18.7 billion, or 33%. 

&#8226; The average cost of total deposits was 2.06% for 2024, up 74 basis points compared to the prior period.

The average cost on long-term debt was 4.80% for 2024, up 43 basis points compared to the prior period. The increases in rates on deposits and other funding sources was largely attributable to the higher rate environment. 

The major components of net interest income and the related annualized yields as well as the variances between the periods caused by changes in interest rates versus changes in volumes are summarized below.

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses was $451 million compared to $538 million for the second quarter of 2023. The net charge-off ratio for the current quarter of 0.58% was up four basis points compared to the prior quarter. 

&#8226; The decrease in the current quarter provision expense primarily reflects a lower allowance build. 

&#8226; The net charge-off ratio was up compared to the second quarter of 2023 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs in the CRE, other consumer, indirect auto, and credit card portfolios, partially offset by lower net charge-offs in the commercial and industrial portfolio. Additionally, the second quarter of 2023 included $98 million of charge-offs related to the sale of the student loan portfolio. 

The provision for credit losses was $951 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $1.0 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The net charge-off ratio for the current period of 0.61% was up 15 basis points compared to the prior period. 

&#8226; The decrease in the current quarter provision expense primarily reflects a lower allowance build. 

&#8226; The net charge-off ratio was up compared to the prior period driven by higher charge-offs in the CRE, other consumer, indirect auto, and credit card portfolios. Additionally, the prior period includes the aforementioned sale of the student loan portfolio.

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income is a significant contributor to Truist&#8217;s financial results. Management focuses on diversifying its sources of revenue to reduce Truist&#8217;s reliance on traditional spread-based interest income, as certain fee-based activities are a relatively stable revenue source during periods of changing interest rates. The following table provides a breakdown of Truist&#8217;s noninterest income: Table 2: Noninterest Income Three Months Ended June 30, % Change Six Months Ended June 30, % Change (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 Wealth management income $ 361 $ 330 9.4 % $ 717 $ 669 7.2 % Investment banking and trading income 286 211 35.5 609 472 29.0 Card and payment related fees 230 236 (2.5) 454 466 (2.6) Service charges on deposits 232 240 (3.3) 457 490 (6.7) Mortgage banking income 112 99 13.1 209 241 (13.3) Lending related fees 89 86 3.5 185 192 (3.6) Operating lease income 50 64 (21.9) 109 131 (16.8) Securities gains (losses) (6,650) &#8212; NM (6,650) &#8212; NM Other income 78 114 (31.6) 144 140 2.9 Total noninterest income $ (5,212) $ 1,380 NM $ (3,766) $ 2,801 NM 

Noninterest income was down $6.6 billion compared to the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to $6.7 billion of securities losses resulting from the balance sheet repositioning and lower other income, partially offset by higher investment banking and trading income and wealth management income. Excluding securities losses, noninterest income was up $58 million compared to the second quarter of 2023. 

&#8226; Investment banking and trading income increased due to higher bond origination fees and loan syndications, partially offset by lower trading income. 

&#8226; Wealth management income increased due to higher assets under management. 

&#8226; Other income decreased due to lower income from certain equity investments. 

Noninterest income was down $6.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to $6.7 billion of securities losses resulting from the balance sheet repositioning and lower service charges on deposits and mortgage banking income, partially offset by higher investment banking and trading income and wealth management income. Excluding securities losses, noninterest income was up $83 million, or 3.0%, compared to the prior period. 

&#8226; Investment banking and trading income increased due to higher bond and equity originations, merger and acquisition fees, and loan syndication fees, partially offset by lower trading income. 

&#8226; Wealth management income increased due to higher assets under management. 

&#8226; Mortgage banking income decreased due to a gain on the sale of a servicing portfolio in the prior year. 

&#8226; Service charges on deposits decreased primarily due to reduced overdraft fees as a result of continued growth of Truist One Banking.

Noninterest Expense 

The following table provides a breakdown of Truist&#8217;s noninterest expense: Table 3: Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended June 30, % Change Six Months Ended June 30, % Change (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 Personnel expense $ 1,661 $ 1,705 (2.6) % $ 3,291 $ 3,373 (2.4) % Professional fees and outside processing 308 311 (1.0) 586 598 (2.0) Software expense 218 223 (2.2) 442 423 4.5 Net occupancy expense 160 166 (3.6) 320 335 (4.5) Amortization of intangibles 89 99 (10.1) 177 199 (11.1) Equipment expense 89 87 2.3 177 189 (6.3) Marketing and customer development 63 69 (8.7) 119 137 (13.1) Operating lease depreciation 34 44 (22.7) 74 90 (17.8) Regulatory costs 85 73 16.4 237 148 60.1 Restructuring charges 33 48 (31.3) 84 104 (19.2) Other expense 354 221 60.2 540 465 16.1 Total noninterest expense $ 3,094 $ 3,046 1.6 $ 6,047 $ 6,061 (0.2) 

Noninterest expense was up $48 million, or 1.6%, compared to the second quarter of 2023 due to a $150 million charitable contribution to the Truist Foundation (other expense) and the FDIC special assessment adjustment in the second quarter of 2024 of $13 million (regulatory costs), partially offset by lower personnel expense. Adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes the charitable contribution, the FDIC special assessment adjustment, restructuring charges, the amortization of intangibles, and a small loss on the early extinguishment of debt in 2023, decreased $86 million, or 3.0%, compared to the earlier quarter. 

&#8226; Personnel expense decreased due to lower headcount across most lines of business, partially offset by higher incentives and higher medical claims. 

&#8226; Other expense increased due to the aforementioned charitable contribution, partially offset by lower pension expenses. 

Noninterest expense was down $14 million, or 0.2%, for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in personnel expense and pension expense (other expenses), partially offset by a $150 million charitable contribution to the Truist Foundation (other expense) in 2024 and FDIC special assessment adjustments in 2024 of $88 million (regulatory costs). Restructuring charges decreased $20 million; both periods included restructuring charges for severance charges as well as facilities optimization costs. Adjusted noninterest expenses, which exclude the charitable contribution, the amortization of intangibles, the FDIC special assessment adjustment, restructuring charges, and a small loss on the early extinguishment of debt, decreased $206 million, or 3.6%. 

&#8226; Personnel expense decreased due to lower headcount across most lines of business, partially offset by higher incentives and higher other post-retirement benefit expense (which is almost entirely offset by higher other income). 

&#8226; Other expense, excluding the aforementioned charitable contribution to the Truist Foundation, decreased primarily due to lower pension expense.

Segment Results 

Truist operates and measures business activity across two segments: CSBB and WB, with functional activities included in OT&#38;C. The Company&#8217;s business segment structure is based on the manner in which financial information is evaluated by management as well as the products and services provided or the type of client served. 

Effective January 1, 2024, several business activities were realigned reflecting updates to the Company&#8217;s operating structure. First, the CB&#38;W segment was renamed CSBB and the C&#38;CB segment was renamed WB. Second, the Wealth business was realigned into the WB segment from the CSBB segment, representing a separate reporting unit in that segment. Third, the small business banking client segmentation was realigned into the CSBB segment from the WB segment. 

On February 20, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the remaining stake of the common equity in TIH to an investor group, representing substantially all of the Company&#8217;s IH segment, which represented a material strategic shift for the Company, and as a result, the Company recast results for all periods presented under the discontinued operations basis of presentation. On May 6, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its remaining equity interests in TIH. TIH was the principal legal entity of the IH segment. As the operations of TIH were included in discontinued operations prior to the sale of TIH, the Company no longer presents the IH segment as one of its reportable segments. Refer to &#8220;Note 2. Discontinued Operations&#8221; for additional information related to discontinued operations.

Consumer and Small Business Banking 

CSBB net income was $898 million for the second quarter of 2024, a decrease of $90 million compared to the second quarter of 2023.

CSBB average loans and leases held for investment decreased $12.3 billion, or 8.9%, for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023, primarily driven by the sale of the student loan portfolio at the end of second quarter of 2023 as well as lower loan balances within the prime auto, residential mortgage, small business, unsecured (Lightstream and direct to consumer), and home equity portfolios, partially offset by growth in the outdoor power sports, equipment and home improvement portfolios. 

CSBB average total deposits decreased $6.4 billion, or 2.9%, for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023, primarily driven by decreases in interest checking, noninterest-bearing deposits, and money market and savings, partially offset by an increase in time deposits.

Analysis of Financial Condition 

Investment Activities 

The securities portfolio totaled $108.4 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $121.5 billion at December 31, 2023. U.S. Treasury, GSE, and Agency MBS represented 99.6% and 97.2% of the total securities portfolio as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The overwhelming majority of the portfolio is in agency MBS securities. 

&#8226; The decrease in 2024 includes sales of $28.1 billion, paydowns and maturities of $9.7 billion as well as a decrease in the fair value of AFS securities, partially offset by $26.0 billion in purchases. The purchases and sales were primarily related to the balance sheet repositioning. 

&#9702; Following the sale of TIH, which resulted in after-tax cash proceeds to Truist of approximately $10.1 billion, Truist executed a strategic balance sheet repositioning of a portion of its AFS investment securities portfolio by selling $27.7 billion of lower-yielding investment securities, resulting in an after-tax loss of $5.1 billion in the second quarter of 2024. The investment securities that were sold had a book value of $34.4 billion and a weighted average book yield of 2.80% for the remainder of 2024 including the impact of hedges and based on the Federal Funds futures curve at the time. Including the tax benefit, the repositioning generated $29.3 billion available for reinvestment. 

&#9702; Truist invested approximately $18.7 billion of the $39.4 billion available, including the $10.1 billion after-tax proceeds from the sale of TIH, in shorter duration investment securities yielding 5.27%. The remaining $20.7 billion was invested in cash. The blended reinvestment rate on the new investment securities purchased and cash is 5.22% for the remainder of 2024 including the impact of hedges and based on the Federal Funds futures curve at the time.

Nonperforming assets totaled $1.5 billion at June 30, 2024, flat compared to March 31, 2024, as declines in the commercial and industrial and commercial construction portfolios were offset by an increase in the CRE portfolio. Nonperforming loans and leases held for investment were 0.46% of loans and leases held for investment at June 30, 2024, up one basis point compared to March 31, 2024. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing totaled $489 million at June 30, 2024, down two basis points as a percentage of loans and leases compared with the prior quarter. Excluding government guaranteed loans, the ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.04% at June 30, 2024, unchanged from March 31, 2024. 

Loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing of $1.8 billion at June 30, 2024 were up $75 million, or three basis points as a percentage of loans and leases, compared to the prior quarter due to increases in the residential mortgage and indirect auto portfolios, partially offset by a decline in the commercial and industrial portfolio.

Commercial Credit Concentrations 

Truist has established the following general practices to manage commercial credit risk: 

&#8226; limiting the amount of credit that Truist may extend to a borrower; 

&#8226; establishing a process for credit approval accountability; 

&#8226; initial underwriting and analysis of borrower, transaction, market, and collateral risks; 

&#8226; ongoing servicing and monitoring of individual loans and lending relationships; 

&#8226; continuous monitoring of the portfolio, market dynamics, and the economy; and 

&#8226; periodically reevaluating the Company&#8217;s strategy and overall exposure as economic, market, and other relevant conditions change. 

Truist continuously monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess potential concentration risks. Management is actively involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk acceptance criteria are adjusted as needed to reflect the Company&#8217;s risk appetite. Consistent with established risk management objectives, the Company utilizes various risk mitigation techniques, including collecting collateral and security interests, obtaining guarantees, and, to a limited extent, through the purchase of credit loss protection via third party insurance or use of credit derivatives such as credit default swaps. 

In the commercial portfolio, risk concentrations are evaluated regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client basis. The Company manages its commercial exposure through portfolio targets, limits, and transactional risk acceptance criteria as well as other techniques, including but not limited to, loan syndications/participations, loan sales, collateral, structure, covenants, and other risk reduction techniques. 

The following tables provide industry distribution by major types of commercial credit exposure and the geographical distribution of commercial exposures. Industry classification for commercial and industrial loans is based on the North American Industry Classification System. Commercial real estate loans are classified based on type of property. For the geographic disclosures, amounts are generally assigned to a state based on the physical billing address of the client or physical property address.

The allowance for credit losses was $5.1 billion as of June 30, 2024 and includes $4.8 billion for the allowance for loan and lease losses and $302 million for the reserve for unfunded commitments. The ALLL ratio was 1.57% as of June 30, 2024, up one basis point compared with March 31, 2024. The ALLL covered nonperforming loans and leases held for investment 3.4X, flat compared to March 31, 2024. At June 30, 2024, the ALLL was 2.7X annualized net charge-offs, compared to 2.4X at March 31, 2024.

Truist monitors the performance of its home equity loans and lines secured by second liens similarly to other consumer loans and utilizes assumptions specific to these loans in determining the necessary ALLL. Truist also receives notification when the first lien holder, whether Truist or another financial institution, has initiated foreclosure proceedings against the borrower. When notified that the first lien is in the process of foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to determine if any additional charge-offs or reserves are warranted. These valuations are updated at least annually thereafter. 

Truist has limited ability to monitor the delinquency status of the first lien, unless the first lien is held or serviced by Truist. Truist estimates credit losses on second lien loans where the first lien is delinquent based on historical experience; the increased risk of loss on these credits is reflected in the ALLL. As of June 30, 2024, Truist held or serviced the first lien on 32% of its second lien positions.

Deposits 

The following table presents average deposits: Table 17: Average Deposits Three Months Ended (Dollars in millions) Jun 30, 2024 Mar 31, 2024 Dec 31, 2023 Sep 30, 2023 Jun 30, 2023 Noninterest-bearing deposits $ 107,634 $ 108,888 $ 114,555 $ 118,905 $ 123,728 Interest checking 103,894 103,537 101,722 101,252 102,105 Money market and savings 135,264 134,696 137,464 139,961 138,149 Time deposits 41,250 41,937 41,592 40,920 35,844 Total average deposits $ 388,042 $ 389,058 $ 395,333 $ 401,038 $ 399,826 

Average deposits for the second quarter of 2024 were $388.0 billion, a decrease of $1.0 billion, or 0.3%, compared to the first quarter of 2024. 

Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 1.2% compared to the first quarter of 2024 and represented 27.7% of total deposits for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 28.0% for the first quarter of 2024. Average time deposits decreased 1.6%. Average money market and savings accounts and interest checking increased 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. 

Borrowings 

At June 30, 2024, short-term borrowings totaled $22.8 billion, a decrease of $2.0 billion compared to December 31, 2023. Average short-term borrowings were $26.1 billion, or 5.8% of total funding, for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $24.0 billion, or 4.9%, for the prior year. 

Long-term debt provides funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital, and primarily consists of senior and subordinated notes issued by Truist and Truist Bank. Long-term debt totaled $34.6 billion at June 30, 2024, a decrease of $4.3 billion compared to December 31, 2023. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company had: 

&#8226; Net redemptions of $4.2 billion of floating rate FHLB advances. 

&#8226; Maturities and redemptions of $3.5 billion of senior notes. 

&#8226; Issuances of $3.5 billion fixed-to-floating rate senior notes with interest rates between 5.44% and 5.71% due from January 24, 2030 to January 24, 2035. 

In August 2024, Truist issued $1.0 billion fixed-to-floating rate senior notes with an interest rate of 5.15% due August 5, 2032. 

Shareholders&#8217; Equity 

Truist&#8217;s book value per common share and TBVPS are presented in the following table: Table 18: Book Value per Common Share (Dollars in millions, except per share data, shares in thousands) Jun 30, 2024 Dec 31, 2023 Common equity per common share $ 42.71 $ 39.31

(1) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impact of intangible assets, net of deferred taxes. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or developed internally. Truist&#8217;s management uses this measure to assess balance sheet risk and shareholder value. 

Truist Financial Corporation 69 

Total shareholders&#8217; equity was $63.8 billion at June 30, 2024, an increase of $4.6 billion from December 31, 2023. This increase was driven by $4.0 billion in OCI and net income of $2.1 billion, partially offset by $1.6 billion in common and preferred dividends. Truist&#8217;s book value per common share at June 30, 2024 was $42.71, compared to $39.31 at December 31, 2023. Truist&#8217;s TBVPS was $28.91 at June 30, 2024, compared to $21.83 at December 31, 2023 with the increase driven by the sale of TIH. 

Risk Management 

Truist seeks to maintain a comprehensive risk management framework supported by people, processes, and systems to identify, measure, monitor, manage, and report significant risks arising from its exposures and business activities. Effective risk management involves optimizing risk and return while operating in a safe and sound manner and promoting compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Company&#8217;s risk management framework is designed to promote the execution of business strategies and objectives in alignment with its risk appetite. 

Truist has developed and employs a risk framework that further guides business functions in identifying, measuring, responding to, monitoring, and reporting on possible exposures to the organization. Truist has developed a risk taxonomy designed to drive internal risk measurement and monitoring and enable Truist to clearly and transparently communicate to stakeholders the level of potential risk the Company faces and the Company&#8217;s position on managing risk to acceptable levels. 

Truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports identification and escalation of risks across the organization. All teammates are responsible for upholding the Company&#8217;s purpose, mission, and values, and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the Company&#8217;s culture. The Truist code of ethics guides the Company&#8217;s decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance. 

Truist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations. Risk-taking activities must be evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive risk-adjusted returns, while preserving asset value and capital. 

Truist&#8217;s compensation plans are designed to consider teammates&#8217; adherence to and successful implementation of Truist&#8217;s risk values and associated policies and procedures. The Company&#8217;s compensation structure is designed to support its core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risk-taking behavior. 

Market Risk 

Market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios, securities, or other financial instruments. Market risk results from changes in the level, volatility, or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices, including interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity, and commodity prices. 

Effective management of market risk is essential to achieving Truist&#8217;s strategic financial objectives. Truist&#8217;s most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet; however, market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk, price risk, and volatility risk in Truist&#8217;s business units. Interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related options inherently embedded in bank products (options risk). 

The primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income, net income, and capital, and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. At Truist, market risk management also includes the enterprise-wide IPV function. 

Interest Rate Market Risk 

As a financial institution, Truist is exposed to interest rate risk from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet positions. Truist primarily monitors this risk through two measurement types, (i) NII at risk and (ii) economic value of equity, and manages this risk with securities, derivatives, and broader asset liability management activities. 

IRR measurement is reported monthly through the ALCO. Monthly IRR reporting includes exposure and historical trends relative to risk limit scenarios, impacts to a wide range of rate scenarios, and sensitivity tests of key assumptions. IRR reporting is provided to the BRC monthly and reviews of varying IRR topics are performed quarterly. 

70 Truist Financial Corporation 

IRR measurement is influenced by data, assumptions, and models. Due to their high sensitivity to market rates, mortgage (loan and security) prepayments leverage an industry model that results in varying prepayment speeds across rate scenarios. Prepayments for non-mortgage loans leverage a mix of dynamic models and static prepayment assumptions based on historical experience. Interest-bearing-deposit rate paid is projected to move at a ratio (deposit beta) of market rates, primarily the Federal Funds Rate, aligned to historical experience. 

Truist uses derivatives to hedge interest income variability of floating rate loans and to hedge valuation changes of long-term debt and investment securities. 

NII at risk measures the change in NII under alternate interest rate scenarios relative to Truist&#8217;s baseline scenario, which incorporates Truist&#8217;s current balance sheet and off-balance sheet hedges as well as expectations for new business over the forecast horizon. Truist&#8217;s baseline scenario relies on assumptions including expectations of the economy and interest rates &#8211; which are influenced by market conditions, new business volume, pricing, and customer behavior. In measuring NII at risk, Truist assumes that changes in key factors, such as prepayments and deposit pricing (betas), largely move in line with those it has experienced in prior rate cycles. However, future behavior of key factors may vary from those used in this measurement. NII at risk measurement assumes, when applicable, that U.S. interest rates floor at zero and Truist does not take any balance sheet or hedging actions in response to the rate scenarios. 

Truist evaluates a wide range of alternate scenarios including instantaneous and gradual as well as parallel and non-parallel changes in interest rates. The table below presents the estimated change to NII over the following 12 months for select parallel alternate scenarios, expressed as a percentage change relative to baseline NII. Table 19: Interest Sensitivity Simulation Analysis Jun 30, 2024 Dec 31, 2023 Up 200bps gradual change in interest rates (2.22) % (1.46) % Up 50bps instantaneous change in interest rates (0.67) (0.36) 

Down 50bps instantaneous change in interest rates 

0.22 (0.10) 

Down 200bps gradual change in interest rates 

0.70 (0.30) 

Estimated changes to NII in the table above assume no change in deposit balances or mix relative to the baseline scenario. In increasing interest rate scenarios, rotation from non-interest-bearing into interest bearing deposits would reduce NII. Conversely, in decreasing interest rate scenarios, rotation from higher yielding to lower yielding deposits would benefit net interest income. Truist performs and monitors sensitivity tests of deposit and other key assumptions used in NII risk including: 

&#8226; Asset prepayment speeds 

&#8226; New loan volume pricing spreads 

&#8226; Interest-bearing deposit betas 

&#8226; Non-interest-bearing demand deposit balance runoff, replaced by market funding 

EVE measures changes in the economic value of Truist&#8217;s current balance sheet and off-balance sheet hedges under alternate rate scenarios relative to starting economic value. Truist uses EVE as a longer-term measure of interest rate risk. Truist performs and monitors sensitivity tests of key assumptions used in EVE including: 

&#8226; Asset prepayment speeds 

&#8226; Mortgage spreads (mortgage loan and security valuations) 

&#8226; Interest-bearing deposit beta 

&#8226; Deposit runoff / decay 

Key assumption tests are generally performed by increasing and decreasing the assumption, whether static or dynamically modeled, relative to their respective starting values and then measuring the resulting impact to NII and EVE under baseline and alternate rate scenarios. 

The identification and testing of key assumptions are influenced by market conditions and management views of key risks. The results of key assumption sensitivity tests are reported to ALCO and BRC at least quarterly. The inventory of key assumptions and their associated sensitivity tests are reviewed with ALCO and BRC at least annually. 

Market Risk from Trading Activities 

As a financial intermediary, Truist provides its clients access to derivatives, foreign exchange and securities markets, which generate market risks. Trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach, which includes measuring risk using VaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level. 

Truist Financial Corporation 71 

Truist is also subject to risk-based capital guidelines for market risk under the Market Risk Rule. 

Covered Trading Positions 

Covered positions subject to the Market Risk Rule include trading assets and liabilities, specifically those held for the purpose of short-term resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits. Truist&#8217;s trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the Company&#8217;s clients, as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity. The trading portfolio, measured in terms of VaR, consists primarily of four sub-portfolios of covered positions: (i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income securities, (iii) interest rate derivatives, and (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker across different asset classes, Truist&#8217;s trading portfolio also contains other sub-portfolios, including foreign exchange, loan trading, and commodity derivatives; however, these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures. 

Valuation policies and methodologies exist for all trading positions. Additionally, these positions are subject to independent price verification. See &#8220;Note 16. Derivative Financial Instruments,&#8221; &#8220;Note 15. Fair Value Disclosures,&#8221; and &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; herein for discussion of valuation policies and methodologies. 

Securitizations 

As of June 30, 2024, the aggregate market value of on-balance sheet securitization positions subject to the Market Risk Rule, which were non-agency asset backed securities positions, was $96 million. Consistent with the Market Risk Rule requirements, the Company performs pre-purchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including, but not limited to, deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets, that materially affect valuation and performance. Securitization positions are subject to Truist&#8217;s comprehensive risk management framework, which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits. There were no off-balance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period. 

Correlation Trading Positions 

The trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of June 30, 2024. 

VaR-Based Measures 

VaR measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon. Truist utilizes a historical VaR methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions. For risk management purposes, the VaR calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a one-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the Company calculates VaR using a 10-day holding period and a 99% confidence level. Due to inherent limitations of the VaR methodology, such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance, VaR is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk. Other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing, scenario analysis, and stop loss limits. 

72 Truist Financial Corporation 

The trading portfolio&#8217;s VaR profile is influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and composition of the portfolio, market volatility, and the correlation between different positions. A portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual sub-portfolios, because, under normal market conditions, risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories. The following table summarizes certain VaR-based measures for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. Table 20: VaR-based Measures Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (Dollars in millions) 10-Day Holding Period 1-Day Holding Period 10-Day Holding Period 1-Day Holding Period 10-Day Holding Period 1-Day Holding Period 10-Day Holding Period 1-Day Holding Period VaR-based Measures: Maximum $ 25 $ 7 $ 24 $ 9 $ 27 $ 12 $ 24 $ 9 Average 20 6 18 7 21 8 17 6 Minimum 14 5 14 5 14 5 10 4 Period-end 23 7 17 7 23 7 17 7 VaR by Risk Class: Interest Rate Risk 7 4 7 4 Credit Spread Risk 10 6 10 6 Equity Price Risk 3 4 3 4 Foreign Exchange Risk &#8212; 1 &#8212; 1 Portfolio Diversification (13) (8) (13) (8) Period-end 7 7 7 7 

Stressed VaR-based measures 

Stressed VaR, another component of market risk capital, is calculated using the same internal models as used for the VaR-based measure. Stressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level and employs a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelve-month historical window selected to reflect a period of significant financial stress for the Company&#8217;s trading portfolio. The following table summarizes Stressed VaR-based measures: Table 21: Stressed VaR-based Measures - 10 Day Holding Period Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Maximum $ 209 $ 96 $ 209 $ 96 Average 148 54 131 49 Minimum 82 25 69 25 Period-end 154 96 154 96 

Compared to the same period of prior year, Stressed VaR measures were higher, primarily due to higher market making inventory. 

Specific Risk Measures 

Specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements (e.g., default or event risks). The Market Risk Rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a model-based approach, subject to regulatory approval. Truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital. As such, incremental risk capital requirements do not apply. 

VaR Model Backtesting 

In accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the Company evaluates the accuracy of its VaR model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) from covered positions with the corresponding daily VaR-based measures generated by the model. As illustrated in the following graph, there were no Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended June 30, 2024. The total number of Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the VaR-based capital requirement under the Market Risk Rule. The capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four, depending on the number of exceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of VaR model use and performance. There was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months. 

Truist Financial Corporation 73 

Model Risk Oversight 

MRO is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models. The validation activities are conducted in accordance with MRO policy, which incorporates regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness, ongoing monitoring, and outcomes analysis. As part of ongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of all trading risk models is reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets, assess evolving modeling approaches, and identify potential model enhancement. 

Stress Testing 

The Company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily VaR and other risk limits reporting. The stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme, but plausible, stress scenarios that could lead to large, unexpected losses. Stress tests include simulations for risk factor sensitivities, historical repeats, and hypothetical scenarios with varying liquidity horizons of key risk factors. All trading positions within each applicable market risk category (interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange rate risk, credit spread risk, and commodity price risk) are included in the Company&#8217;s comprehensive stress testing framework. Management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates, as necessary, to capture both current and emerging risks. Management also utilizes stress analyses to support the Company&#8217;s capital adequacy assessment standards. See the &#8220;Capital&#8221; section of MD&#38;A for additional discussion of capital adequacy. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs, including deposit withdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other liabilities, and funding of loan commitments. In addition to the level of liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents, and highly liquid unencumbered securities, other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including access to a variety of funding sources, maintaining borrowing capacity, growing core deposits, loan repayment, and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale. 

Truist monitors the ability to meet client demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions. In considering its liquidity position, management evaluates Truist&#8217;s funding mix based on client core funding, client rate-sensitive funding, and national markets funding. In addition, management evaluates exposure to rate-sensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less. Management also measures liquidity needs for up to one-year of stressed cash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To promote a strong liquidity position and compliance with regulatory requirements, management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities to meet projected 30 days of stressed cash outflows. 

74 Truist Financial Corporation 

Internal Liquidity Stress Testing 

Liquidity stress testing is conducted for Truist and Truist Bank using a variety of institution-specific and market-wide adverse scenarios. Each liquidity stress test scenario applies defined assumptions to execute sources and uses of liquidity over varying planning horizons. The types of expected liquidity uses during a stressed event may include, but are not limited to, deposit attrition, contractual maturities, reductions in unsecured and secured funding, and increased draws on unfunded commitments. To mitigate liquidity outflows, Truist has identified sources of liquidity; however, access to these sources of liquidity could be affected within a stressed environment. 

Truist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities that is sufficient to meet the projected 30-day net stressed cash-flow needs and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. The liquidity buffer consists of unencumbered highly liquid assets and Truist&#8217;s liquidity buffer is substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as HQLA under the LCR Rule. 

Contingency Funding Plan 

Truist has a contingency funding plan designed to address ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in the event of a liquidity contraction. This plan is designed to examine and quantify the organization&#8217;s liquidity under the various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plan&#8217;s reliability. Additionally, the plan provides a framework for management and other teammates to follow in the event of a liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event. The plan addresses authority for activation and decision making, liquidity options, and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction. 

LCR, NSFR, and HQLA 

The LCR rule requires that Truist and Truist Bank maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy operational requirements of the LCR rule. Truist and Truist Bank are subject to the Category III reduced LCR requirements. Truist held average weighted eligible HQLA of $81.0 billion and Truist&#8217;s average LCR was 110% for the three months ended June 30, 2024. 

The NSFR rule requires that Truist and Truist Bank maintain a minimum amount of stable, long-term funding in relation to its asset composition and off-balance sheet activities. Truist and Truist Bank are subject to the Category III reduced NSFR requirements. At June 30, 2024, Truist was compliant with this requirement. 

Sources of Funds 

Management believes current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet Truist&#8217;s on- and off-balance sheet obligations. Truist funds its balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including client deposits, secured and unsecured capital markets funding, and shareholders&#8217; equity. Truist Bank&#8217;s primary source of funding is client deposits. Continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of Truist Bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested. 

Truist Bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements. These sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes, institutional CDs, overnight and term Federal funds markets, and retail brokered CDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to secured borrowing sources including FHLB advances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB discount window. Available investment securities could be pledged to create additional secured borrowing capacity. The following table presents a summary of Truist Bank&#8217;s available secured borrowing capacity and eligible cash at the FRB: 

Table 22: Selected Liquidity Sources (Dollars in millions) Jun 30, 2024 Dec 31, 2023 Unused borrowing capacity: FRB $ 63,142 $ 55,252 FHLB 32,892 24,712 Available investment securities (after haircuts) 

64,610 74,717 Available secured borrowing capacity 160,644 154,681 Eligible cash at the FRB 35,548 25,085 Total $ 196,192 $ 179,766 

At June 30, 2024, Truist Bank&#8217;s available secured borrowing capacity represented approximately 4.8 times the amount of wholesale funding maturities in one-year or less. 

Truist Financial Corporation 75 

Parent Company 

The Parent Company serves as the primary source of capital for the operating subsidiaries. The Parent Company&#8217;s assets consist primarily of cash on deposit with Truist Bank, equity investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and notes receivable from subsidiaries. The principal obligations of the Parent Company are payments on long-term debt. The main sources of funds for the Parent Company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries, repayments of advances to subsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance of equity and long-term debt. The primary uses of funds by the Parent Company are investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders, repurchases of common stock, and payments on and, from time-to-time, potential repurchases or redemptions of a portion of an outstanding tranche of the long-term debt of the Parent Company (as may be permitted by the terms of each respective series). See &#8220;Note 22. Parent Company Financial Information&#8221; in Truist&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions. 

Access to funding at the Parent Company is more sensitive to market disruptions. Therefore, Truist prudently manages cash levels at the Parent Company to cover a minimum of one year of projected cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments, debt service, common and preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities, without the benefit of any new cash inflows from subsidiary dividends to the Parent or capital market activity. Truist maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of cash outflows. In determining the buffer, Truist considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates, serving as a source of strength to Truist Bank, and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital markets. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Parent Company had 54 months and 48 months, respectively, of cash on hand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and 32 months and 30 months, respectively, when including the payment of common stock dividends. 

Credit Ratings 

Credit ratings are forward-looking opinions of rating agencies as to the Company&#8217;s ability to meet its financial commitments and repay its securities and obligations in accordance with their terms of issuance. Credit ratings influence both borrowing costs and access to the capital markets. The Company&#8217;s credit ratings are continuously monitored by the rating agencies and are subject to change at any time. As Truist seeks to maintain high-quality credit ratings, management meets with the major rating agencies on a regular basis to provide financial and business updates and to discuss current outlooks and trends. See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Truist&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information regarding factors that influence credit ratings and potential risks that could materialize in the event of downgrade in the Company&#8217;s credit ratings. Recent changes in the Company&#8217;s credit ratings and outlooks include: 

&#8226; On May 8, 2024, Moody&#8217;s Ratings downgraded Truist's long-term senior unsecured rating to Baa1 from A3 and Truist Bank&#8217;s baseline credit assessment to a3 from a2 and long-term deposits rating to A1 from Aa3. In addition, Truist Bank&#8217;s short-term deposit rating was affirmed at Prime-1. Ratings outlooks for both Truist and Truist Bank were changed to stable. 

Capital 

The maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. Truist&#8217;s principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support Truist&#8217;s risk profile consistent with the Board-approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve optimal credit ratings for Truist and its subsidiaries, remain a source of strength for its subsidiaries, and provide a competitive return to shareholders. Risk-based capital ratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and Total capital are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets.

Truist regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to periodically submit the Company&#8217;s capital plans and stress testing results to the banking regulators. Management regularly monitors the capital position of Truist on both a consolidated and bank-level basis. In this regard, management&#8217;s objective is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of internal capital limits, which are above the regulatory &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; minimums. Management has implemented internal stress capital ratio minimums to evaluate whether capital ratios calculated after the effect of alternative capital actions are likely to remain above internal minimums. Breaches of internal stressed minimums prompt a review of the planned capital actions included in Truist&#8217;s capital plan.

(1) Reflects a SCB requirement of 2.9% applicable to Truist as of June 30, 2024. Truist&#8217;s SCB requirement, received in the 2023 CCAR process, is effective from October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Under the 2024 CCAR process, Truist was notified its preliminary SCB requirement would be 2.8% from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. 

Truist completed the 2024 CCAR process and received a preliminary SCB requirement of 2.8% for the period October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025, down 10 basis points from the SCB requirement for the period October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The FRB will provide Truist with its final SCB requirement by August 31, 2024. 

The FRB&#8217;s capital plan rule provides that a BHC must update and resubmit its capital plan if the BHC determines there has been or will be a material change in its risk profile, financial condition, or corporate structure since it last submitted the capital plan. Truist determined that the sale of our remaining equity interests in TIH constitutes such a material change and, therefore, addressed the material change in our capital plan submitted in April 2024. The capital plan rule further provides that, upon the occurrence of an event requiring resubmission, a BHC may not make any capital distribution unless it has received prior approval of the FRB pending the FRB's consideration of the capital plan resubmission and stress capital buffer requirement. In July 2024, the FRB notified Truist that Truist is no longer required to receive the FRB&#8217;s prior approval to make capital distributions in connection with the April 2024 capital plan submission. 

Truist&#8217;s capital ratios are presented in the following table: Table 24: Capital Ratios - Truist Financial Corporation (Dollars in millions) Jun 30, 2024 Dec 31, 2023 Risk-based: (preliminary) &#160; CET1 11.6 % 10.1 % Tier 1 capital 13.2 11.6 Total capital 15.4 13.7 Leverage ratio 10.5 9.3 Supplementary leverage ratio 8.9 7.9 Risk-weighted assets $ 412,406 $ 423,705 

Capital ratios significantly strengthened compared to the regulatory requirements for well capitalized banks. Truist&#8217;s CET1 ratio was 11.6% as of June 30, 2024, up 150 basis points compared to March 31, 2024 due to the sale of TIH and organic capital generation, partially offset by the balance sheet repositioning. Truist did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter of 2024. Truist's board of directors has authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program beginning in the third quarter of 2024 through 2026 as part of the Company's overall capital distribution strategy. Truist declared common dividends of $0.52 per share during the second quarter of 2024 and maintained its current quarterly common stock dividend in the third quarter of 2024. 

Truist&#8217;s average consolidated LCR was 110% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the regulatory minimum of 100%.

(3) In June 2024, Truist announced that the Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2024 through 2026 as part of Truist&#8217;s overall capital distribution strategy. Repurchased shares revert to the status of authorized and unissued shares upon repurchase. The share-repurchase program enables Truist to acquire shares through open-market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans and other programs, at the discretion of management and on terms (including quantity, timing, and price) that management determines to be advisable. Actions in connection with the share-repurchase program will be subject to various factors, including Truist's capital and liquidity positions and related internal frameworks, accounting and regulatory considerations (including any restrictions that may be imposed by the FRB and any changes to capital, liquidity, and other regulatory requirements that may be proposed or adopted by the U.S. banking agencies), Truist's financial and operational performance, alternative uses of capital, the trading price of Truist's common stock, and general market conditions. The share-repurchase program does not obligate Truist to acquire a specific dollar amount or number of shares and may be extended, modified, or discontinued at any time. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and reporting policies of Truist are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Truist&#8217;s financial position and results of operations are affected by management&#8217;s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions, and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities, and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position and/or consolidated results of operations, and related disclosures. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the ACL; determination of fair value for securities, MSRs, LHFS, trading loans, and derivative assets and liabilities; goodwill and other intangible assets; income taxes; and pension and postretirement benefit obligations. Understanding Truist&#8217;s accounting policies is fundamental to understanding the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. The critical accounting policies are discussed in MD&#38;A in Truist&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Disclosures regarding the effects of new accounting pronouncements are included in &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; in this report. There have been no other changes to the critical accounting policies during 2024. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Effective January 1, 2024, several business activities were realigned reflecting updates to the Company&#8217;s operating structure. First, the CB&#38;W segment was renamed CSBB and the C&#38;CB segment was renamed WB. Second, the Wealth business was realigned into the WB segment from the CSBB segment, representing a separate reporting unit in that segment. Third, the small business banking client segmentation was realigned into the CSBB segment from the WB segment. Further, TIH was the principal legal entity of the IH segment. As the operations of TIH were included in discontinued operations prior to the sale of TIH, the Company no longer presents the IH segment as one of its reportable segments. Following these realignments, the Company&#8217;s three reporting units with goodwill balances were CSBB, WB, and Wealth. Also in conjunction with these realignments, goodwill of $1.7 billion was realigned to WB from CSBB based on the relative fair value of CSBB and Wealth, and goodwill of $220 million was realigned to CSBB from WB based on the relative fair value of WB and the realigned small business banking client segmentation. In addition, the Company completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all impacted reporting units immediately prior and subsequent to the reassignments and determined that no impairment existed.

The quantitative valuations of these reporting units for purposes of realigning goodwill use the income approach and a market-based approach, each weighted at 50%. The inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations, including projections of future cash flows, discount rates, and applicable valuation multiples based on the comparable public company information. The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis of multi-year financial forecasts developed for each reporting unit by considering several inputs and assumptions such as net interest margin, expected credit losses, noninterest income, noninterest expense, and required capital. The market-based approach utilizes comparable public company information, key valuation multiples, and considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise from obtaining control over a reporting unit, and guideline transactions, when applicable. 

Truist also assesses the reasonableness of the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units by comparison to its market capitalization over a reasonable period of time, including consideration of expected acquirer expense synergies, historic bank control premiums, and the current market. 

The projection of net interest margin and noninterest expense are the most significant inputs to the financial projections of the CSBB, WB, and Wealth reporting units. The long-term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was 3% as of January 1, 2024, based on management&#8217;s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit. Discount rates are estimated based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, and unsystematic risk adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. The discount rates are also calibrated based on risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. The discount rates utilized for the CSBB, WB and Wealth reporting units as of January 1, 2024 were 13.0%, 11.5%, and 12.5%, respectively. 

The quantitative valuation of WB performed in conjunction with the goodwill realignments indicated that as of January 1, 2024, the fair value of the WB reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by less than 10%, indicating that the goodwill of the WB reporting unit may be at risk of impairment. Circumstances that could negatively impact the fair value for the WB reporting unit in the future include a sustained decrease in Truist&#8217;s stock price, a decline in industry peer multiples, an increase in the applicable discount rate, and deterioration in the reporting unit&#8217;s forecast. 

The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in management&#8217;s estimates and assumptions; therefore, in some instances, changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. The valuation of the WB reporting unit as of January 1, 2024 indicated that if the discount rate were increased less than 50 basis points, the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value would be less than its carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment. Ultimately, future potential changes in management&#8217;s assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. Additionally, a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying value could change based on market conditions, change in the underlying makeup of the reporting unit, or the risk profile of those reporting units, which could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value. 

The Company monitored events and circumstances during the period from January 1, 2024 to June 30, 2024, including macroeconomic and market factors, industry and banking sector events, Truist specific performance indicators, a comparison of management&#8217;s forecast and assumptions to those used in its January 1, 2024 quantitative valuations associated with the realignments of goodwill, and the sensitivity of the January 1, 2024 quantitative results to changes in assumptions as of June 30, 2024. Based on these considerations, Truist concluded that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of June 30, 2024. 

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations 

Following the sale of TIH, Truist retained the postretirement benefit obligation for TIH employees and changed the status of TIH employees by eliminating their eligibility to earn future service credits. Changes in pension plan obligations associated with the disposal of operating segments such as TIH require the remeasurement of postretirement benefit obligations prior to the disposal, updates to pension plan assumptions inherent in valuations, and identification and recognition of valuation changes specific to the sale, including the establishment of a new periodic service cost using assumptions as of the remeasurement date. The remeasurement process of impacted pension plans included a reduction in pension benefit obligations of $783 million, primarily driven by an increase in the weighted average assumed discount rate from 5.12% to 5.78%, and a decrease in the value of plan assets by $508 million, primarily driven by market prices. The impact of the sale on Truist pension plans resulted in a reduction of pension benefit obligations by $97 million which was recorded as a reduction of AOCI. 

Refer to &#8220;Note 15. Benefit Plans&#8221; in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and &#8220;Note 13. Benefit Plans&#8221; for disclosures related to the benefit plans.
