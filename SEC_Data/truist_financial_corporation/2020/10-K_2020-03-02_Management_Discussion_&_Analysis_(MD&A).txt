Executive Overview 

&#160; 

Overview of Recent Events and Financial Results 

Recent Events 

Effective December 6, 2019, the Company completed the Merger. Upon closing, each SunTrust share was exchanged for 1.295 shares of BB&#38;T stock. In connection with the Merger, the Company changed its name from BB&#38;T Corporation to Truist Financial Corporation. Reported results for Truist reflect heritage BB&#38;T prior to the completion of the Merger and results from both BB&#38;T and SunTrust from the Merger closing date forward. Period end balances reflect the combined companies. Significant Merger updates include: 

&#8226; In July 2019, BB&#38;T and SunTrust announced the Truist Bank Community Benefits Plan under which the combined company will lend or invest $60 billion to low and moderate-income borrowers and communities over a three-year period from 2020 to 2022. 

&#8226; In November 2019, the Department of Justice completed its anti-trust review and the Company received all remaining regulatory approvals. As a condition for the Merger, the Company announced an agreement to divest 30 SunTrust branches in North Carolina, Virginia and Georgia. The divestiture includes approximately $2.4 billion in deposits and approximately $400 million in loans. 

&#8226; On December 11, 2019, Truist announced its planned purchase of the new headquarters building, Hearst Tower, in Charlotte, NC. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2020. The building will be renamed Truist Center. 

&#8226; In January 2020, Truist officially launched the Truist brand and visual identity, and Truist&#8217;s purpose: &#8220;Inspire and build better lives and communities,&#8221; along with its mission and values. 

Financial Results 

Net income available to common shareholders totaled $3.0 billion for 2019, a 1.1% decrease from the prior year. On a diluted per common share basis, earnings for 2019 were $3.71, compared to $3.91 for 2018. Truist's results of operations for 2019 produced a return on average assets of 1.31% and a return on average common shareholders' equity of 9.87% compared to prior year ratios of 1.47% and 11.50%, respectively. Results include merger-related and restructuring charges of $360 million ($285 million after-tax) for 2019 compared to $146 million ($111 million after-tax) for 2018. Additionally, the 2019 results include incremental operating expenses related to the Merger of $164 million ($127 million after-tax), securities losses of $116 million ($90 million after-tax), a reduction in net income available to common shareholders of $46 million arising from the redemption of preferred stock, partially offset by a $14 million after-tax net gain from the sale of residential mortgage loans. 

Truist's revenue for 2019 was $12.6 billion. On a TE basis, revenue was $12.7 billion, which represents an increase of $1.0 billion compared to 2018. Net interest income on a TE basis was $7.4 billion, an increase of $631 million compared to the prior year, which reflects a $1.3 billion increase in interest income and a $658 million increase in interest expense. The increase in net interest income was due primarily to a $15.2 billion increase in average outstanding loans, a $3.5 billion increase in average securities coupled with a 19 basis point increase in earning asset yields. 

NIM was 3.42% for 2019, down 4 basis points compared to the prior year. Average earning assets increased $20.6 billion or 10.5%, while average interest-bearing liabilities increased $17.6 billion, or 13.2%, and noninterest-bearing deposits increased $1.7 billion, or 3.1%. The annualized TE yield on the total loan portfolio for 2019 was 4.99%, up 22 basis points compared to the prior year. The annualized TE yield on the average securities portfolio was 2.62%, up 13 basis points compared to the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $615 million, compared to $566 million for the prior year. Net charge-offs for 2019 were $634 million, compared to $524 million for the prior year. The ratio of the ALLL to net charge-offs was 2.44X for 2019, compared to 2.98X in 2018. NPAs increased $99 million year over year, including NPAs from the Merger of $107 million that are classified as LHFS, $63 million for loans HFI and $63 million for other nonperforming assets, offset by NPL sales.

Noninterest income increased $379 million for the year, driven by improvements in the majority of categories, partially offset by securities losses of $116 million and a decrease in other income of $39 million. Approximately $217 million of the increase in noninterest income is due to the contribution from the Merger. Additional increases in noninterest income were primarily due to higher insurance income driven by improved production levels and the acquisition of Regions Insurance, as well as higher investment banking and trading income. Noninterest expense increased $1.0 billion for the year. Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges and other incremental operating expenses related to the Merger, noninterest expense increased $624 million. Approximately $400 million of the $624 million variance was the result of noninterest expense associated with merged operations. The residual variance was primarily due to an increase in personnel expense. 

Truist's total assets at December 31, 2019 were $473.1 billion, an increase of $247.4 billion compared to December 31, 2018. The Merger contributed $235.7 billion in total assets, including $154.0 billion in loans and leases. Refer to "Note 2. Business Combinations" for additional details related to the opening balances from the Merger. 

The Company has undertaken a number of strategic actions to enhance the credit quality and manage interest-rate sensitivity of its loan and lease portfolio. During the third quarter of 2019, management sold a $4.3 billion residential mortgage loan portfolio. This sale was followed by a number of balance sheet restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2019, including the transfer of: 

&#8226; $2.5 billion of residential mortgage loans to LHFS; 

&#8226; $356 million of commercial loans to LHFS as a result of a decision to exit a business; and 

&#8226; $381 million of mortgage, consumer and commercial loans to LHFS related to the forthcoming branch divestiture arising from the Merger. 

In addition, $1.4 billion of commercial exposures, of which $516 million were funded, were included in the LHFS portfolio of SunTrust at the Merger date. 

Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2019, management sold $33.2 billion of securities in order to improve yield and reduce premium amortization risk and reinvested the proceeds primarily in securities to position the Company to meet the new tailored LCR requirements. The Company also transferred the securities previously classified as HTM to AFS in response to changes in regulatory capital rules. 

Total deposits at December 31, 2019 were $334.7 billion, an increase of $173.5 billion from the prior year. The Merger contributed $170.7 billion in total deposits. The average cost of total deposits for 2019 was 0.64%, an increase of 23 basis points compared to the prior year. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits for 2019 was 0.93%, up 31 basis points compared to the prior year. 

Total shareholders' equity was $66.6 billion at December 31, 2019, up $36.4 billion compared to the prior year. Equity issued in connection with the Merger was $33.5 billion and net income in excess of dividends paid was $1.8 billion. Additionally, the Company issued $1.7 billion of preferred stock during the year and redeemed a similar amount from two higher-cost issuances. In connection with the redemptions, net income available to common shareholders was reduced by $46 million to recognize the difference in the redemption price and the carrying value. Truist's Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios at December 31, 2019 were 10.8% and 12.6%, respectively, compared to 11.8% and 13.8% at December 31, 2018, respectively. The CET1 ratio was 9.5% at December 31, 2019 compared to 10.2% in the prior year. 

Key Challenges 

Truist's business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, management annually evaluates and, as necessary, adjusts the Company's business strategy in the context of the current operating environment. During this process, management considers the current financial condition and performance of the Company and its expectations for future economic activity from both a national and local market perspective. Achieving key strategic objectives and established long-term financial goals is subject to many uncertainties and challenges. In the opinion of management, the following challenges are the most likely to impact Truist&#8217;s near to medium term performance: 

&#8226; Achieving the potential benefits from the Merger, including anticipated synergies and cost savings; 

&#8226; Managing the integration of systems and operations, while safeguarding the Company against external threats; 

&#8226; Executing the Company&#8217;s &#8220;T3 strategy&#8221; by focusing on personal touch and technology to engender trust and provide distinctive, secure and successful client experiences; 

&#8226; Driving innovation and remaining attuned to evolving client preferences to succeed in an intensely competitive environment; 

&#8226; Retaining key personnel and activating the Company&#8217;s culture of striving to make things better for its clients, teammates and stakeholders; and 

&#8226; Navigating global economic and geopolitical risks and ensuring that the Company is well positioned for changes in the credit cycle. 

In addition, certain other challenges and unforeseen events could have a near term impact on Truist's financial condition and results of operations. See the sections titled "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" for additional examples of such challenges.

Analysis of Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income and NIM 

&#160; 

2019 compared to 2018 

&#160; 

Net interest income on a TE basis was $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $631 million compared to the same period in 2018. Interest income increased $1.3 billion, which reflects both earning asset growth and higher earning asset yields. Interest expense increased $658 million due primarily to higher funding costs reflecting the lagged impact of 2018 increases in the federal funds rate. 

Net interest margin was 3.42% for the year ended December 31, 2019, down four basis points compared to the same period of 2018. Loan yields during 2019 averaged 4.99%, up 22 basis points year over year. The increase was due primarily to the lagged effect of rate increases in 2018. The yield on the average securities portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 2.62%, up 13 basis points compared to the same period of 2018 aided by the portfolio restructurings during 2019. 

Average earning assets for 2019 were $216.4 billion, up $20.6 billion compared to 2018, driven by an increase in total loans and leases of $15.2 billion and an increase in securities of $3.5 billion. 

The average cost of total deposits for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 0.64%, up 23 basis points compared to 2018. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.93% in 2019, up 31 basis points compared to the prior year. The average rate on short-term borrowings and long-term debt increased 48 and 34 basis points, respectively, to 2.34% and 3.22% during 2019. Average interest-bearing liabilities were $151.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, up $17.6 billion compared to 2018 driven by a $14.1 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits and a $2.5 billion increase in short-term borrowings. 

Upon completion of the Merger, the merged SunTrust loan portfolio was marked to fair value in accordance with GAAP. The below table includes the associated fair value marks by loan category, together with the Company's current expectation for when half of each fair value mark will be accreted into interest income. Current period results reflect $141 million of loan mark accretion arising from the Merger. As discussed in "Note 2. Business Combinations", the Company's purchase price allocation is preliminary and related fair value estimates are subject to change. Loan mark accretion may vary from period to period based on prepayments, which may shorten or extend the expected lives of the related loans and leases.

Provision for Credit Losses 

2019 compared to 2018 

&#160; 

The provision for credit losses totaled $615 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $566 million for 2018. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $634 million, compared to $524 million for 2018. 

Net charge-offs were 0.40% of average loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 0.36% of average loans and leases for 2018. The increase in net charge-offs was primarily related to credit cards, indirect auto and CRE. 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income is a significant contributor to Truist's financial results. Management focuses on diversifying its sources of revenue to further reduce Truist's reliance on traditional spread-based interest income, as certain fee-based activities are a relatively stable revenue source during periods of changing interest rates.

2019 compared to 2018 

&#160; 

Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $5.3 billion, up $379 million compared to 2018. Approximately $217 million of the increase was due to the contribution from the Merger. 

Insurance income was $2.1 billion, up $220 million compared to 2018 due to higher production levels and insurance acquisitions, which contributed $80 million in 2019. 

Investment banking and trading income was $244 million, up $90 million compared to 2018. Merged operations contributed $54 million and increased client derivative activities contributed $24 million towards the variance. 

Residential mortgage income was $285 million, up $27 million compared to 2018 due to an increase in net MSRs valuation adjustments, partially offset by lower production-related revenues due to lower sales volumes prior to the Merger. 

The increases in noninterest income were partially offset by $116 million in losses arising from the sale of $33.2 billion of securities.

2019 compared to 2018 

&#160; 

Noninterest expense totaled $7.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 14.5%, from 2018. Merger-related and restructuring expense was $360 million, up $214 million due primarily to the Merger and the decision to exit a business. Additionally, the year ended December 31, 2019 included $164 million of incremental operating expenses related to the Merger. Excluding these items, noninterest expense was up $624 million, of which approximately $400 million was due to noninterest expenses from the merged operations. 

&#160; 

Personnel expense was $4.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $520 million compared to 2018. The increase includes $227 million related to personnel expenses of the merged operations and $123 million in incremental operating expenses related to the Merger as well as a $157 million increase in production-based and other incentives, including the impact from the Regions Insurance acquisition. 

Marketing and customer development expense increased $35 million due to higher household growth initiative expenses and merged operations. 

Amortization of intangibles increased $33 million primarily due to the new intangibles created in the Merger. 

Other expense increased $59 million primarily due to the merged operations and higher pension expense. 

The increases in noninterest expense were partially offset by a decrease in regulatory charges of $53 million due largely to the DIF reaching the targeted level.

Merger-Related and Restructuring Charges 

Truist has incurred certain merger-related and restructuring charges, which include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; severance and personnel-related costs or credits; 

&#8226; occupancy and equipment charges or credits, which relate to costs or gains associated with lease terminations, obsolete equipment write-offs and the sale of duplicate facilities and equipment; 

&#8226; professional services, which relate to legal and investment banking advisory fees and other consulting services pertaining to restructuring initiatives or transactions; 

&#8226; systems conversion and related charges, which represent costs to integrate the entity's information technology systems; 

&#8226; other merger-related and restructuring charges or credits, which include expenses necessary to convert and combine the acquired branches and operations of merged companies, direct media advertising related to the mergers and acquisitions, asset and supply inventory write-offs, and other similar charges; and 

&#8226; writes-offs related to exiting certain businesses. 

Merger-related and restructuring accruals are established when the costs are incurred or once all requirements for a plan to dispose of or outsource certain business functions have been approved by management. Merger and restructuring accruals are re-evaluated periodically and adjusted as necessary. The remaining accruals at December 31, 2019 are generally expected to be utilized within one year, unless they relate to specific contracts that expire later. 

The 2019 merger-related and restructuring costs primarily reflect higher charges as a result of the Merger, including costs for severance and other benefits and costs related to exiting facilities, while the 2018 costs primarily reflect branch closures and other restructuring initiatives. 

The following table presents a summary of merger-related and restructuring charges and the related accruals:

&#160; 

Consumer Banking and Wealth 

Consumer Banking and Wealth had 2,958 banking offices at December 31, 2019, an increase of 1,079 offices compared to December 31, 2018. The increase in offices was driven primarily by the Merger, partially offset by the consolidation of nearby financial centers and closure of certain lower volume branches prior to the Merger. 

Consumer Banking and Wealth net income was $1.7 billion, an increase of $224 million, or 15.1%, compared to 2018. Segment net interest income increased $577 million driven by average loan growth, higher funding spreads on deposits and the Merger. Noninterest income increased $161 million due primarily to an increase in service charges on deposits, wealth management income, checkcard fees and the Merger. Noninterest expense increased $449 million driven by higher personnel expense, amortization of intangibles, merger-related charges and allocated corporate expenses primarily attributable to the Merger, as well as higher operating charge-offs and pension expense, excluding service costs. The allocated provision for income taxes increased $58 million due primarily to higher pre-tax income. 

Consumer Banking and Wealth average loans and leases HFI increased $6.9 billion, or 10.8%, compared to 2018 driven primarily by the Merger, mortgage warehouse loans and indirect auto loans. Average loan and leases HFI for mortgage, indirect auto, and home equity and direct lending increased $1.7 billion, or 5.8%, $1.3 billion, or 11.9%, and $891 million, or 7.5%, respectively. 

Consumer Banking and Wealth average total deposits increased $8.4 billion, or 10.1%, compared to 2018 driven primarily by the Merger, money market and savings accounts, and noninterest-bearing deposits. Average noninterest-bearing deposits, money market and savings accounts, and time deposits increased $2.4 billion, or 14.0%, $4.0 billion, or 10.6%, and $1.3 billion, or 11.6%, respectively. 

Client assets under administration totaled $349.7 billion as of December 31, 2019, an increase of $190.2 billion, or 119.2%, compared to 2018, primarily due to the Merger. 

Corporate and Commercial Banking 

Corporate and Commercial Banking net income was $1.8 billion for 2019, an increase of $295 million, or 19.1%, compared to 2018. Segment net interest income increased $302 million, driven by higher funding spreads on deposits, organic loan growth and the Merger, partially offset by lower credit spreads on loans. Noninterest income increased $161 million primarily due to the Merger and higher revenue from client derivatives, loan fees and gains on finance leases, partially offset by tax credit valuation adjustments and lower private equity investment income. Noninterest expense increased $190 million driven by higher personnel expense, merger-related charges, and amortization of intangibles primarily attributable to the Merger as well as lower credits for capitalized employee costs. The allocated provision for income taxes decreased $13 million primarily due to higher tax credits. 

Corporate and Commercial Banking average loans and leases HFI increased $7.3 billion, or 9.3%, compared to 2018 driven primarily by the Merger and growth in corporate loans. Average loan and leases HFI for the Corporate and Institutional Group increased $5.4 billion, or 21.8%, driven primarily by commercial and industrial loans, and lease financing, while average loans and leases HFI for Commercial Community Banking increased $1.8 billion, or 3.5%, driven primarily by commercial and industrial loans. 

Corporate and Commercial Banking average total deposits increased $4.3 billion, or 6.3%, compared to 2018 driven primarily by the Merger and Commercial Community Banking money market savings accounts. Average interest checking increased $3.7 billion, or 41.0%, and average money market and savings increased $981 million, or 4.2%, while average noninterest-bearing deposits declined $653 million, or 1.8%. 

Insurance Holdings 

Insurance Holdings net income was $319 million in 2019, an increase of $66 million, or 26.1%, compared to 2018. Noninterest income increased $240 million primarily due to the acquisition of Regions Insurance, which contributed $78 million, and organic growth in commercial property and casualty and life insurance commissions. Noninterest expense increased $162 million driven by higher salaries, commission-based incentives, the acquisition of Regions Insurance and merger-related and restructuring charges. 

44 Truist Financial Corporation 

Other, Treasury and Corporate 

Other, Treasury and Corporate generated a net loss of $635 million in 2019, compared to a net loss of $30 million in 2018. Segment net interest income decreased $264 million driven by an increase in the net credit for funds provided to other operating segments, an increase in average balances and rates for long-term debt and short-term borrowings, partially offset by an increase in average balances and rates for securities. Noninterest income decreased $183 million due primarily to losses on the sale of securities and lower hedge and client derivative income, partially offset by an increase in income related to certain post-employment benefits. The allocated provision for credit losses increased $45 million driven primarily by an increase in the provision for unfunded commitments and purchased credit-impaired loans compared to 2018. Noninterest expense increased $201 million driven by the Merger, merger-related charges, lower credits for capitalized employee costs and an increase in expense related to certain post-retirement benefits, partially offset by lower restructuring charges. The benefit for income taxes increased $88 million due primarily to an increase in the pre-tax loss, partially offset by a lower tax benefit from discrete items compared to 2018. 

Analysis of Financial Condition 

Investment Activities 

Truist Board-approved investment policy is carried out by the MRLCC, which meets regularly to review the economic environment and establish investment strategies. The MRLCC also has much broader responsibilities, which are discussed in the "Market Risk Management" section in MD&#38;A. 

Investment strategies are reviewed by the MRLCC based on the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix, actual and anticipated loan demand, funding opportunities and the overall interest rate sensitivity of the Company. In general, the goals of the investment portfolio are: (i) to provide a sufficient margin of liquid assets to meet unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations and overall funds management objectives; (ii) to provide eligible securities to secure public funds, trust deposits and other borrowings; and (iii) to earn an optimal return on funds invested commensurate with meeting the requirements of (i) and (ii) and consistent with our risk appetite. 

Truist Bank invests in securities allowable under bank regulations. These securities may include obligations of the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies, GSEs (including MBS), bank eligible obligations of any state or political subdivision, non-agency MBS, structured notes, bank eligible corporate obligations (including corporate debentures), commercial paper, negotiable CDs, bankers acceptances, mutual funds and limited types of equity securities.

The securities portfolio totaled $74.7 billion at December 31, 2019, compared to $45.6 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase in the securities portfolio was due primarily to the Merger, which contributed $31.0 billion in AFS securities. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company transferred the securities previously classified as HTM to AFS in response to changes in regulatory capital rules. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company sold $33.2 billion of securities to improve yield and lower premium amortization risk resulting in $116 million in securities losses. The majority of the proceeds were reinvested in new securities to achieve the desired level of AFS securities for Truist.

As of December 31, 2019, approximately 3.6% of the securities portfolio was variable rate, compared to 6.5% as of December 31, 2018. The effective duration of the securities portfolio excluding certain non-agency MBS was 4.7 years at December 31, 2019, compared to 4.8 years at December 31, 2018. 

U.S. Treasury, GSE and Agency MBS represented 98.7% of the total securities portfolio as of December 31, 2019, compared to 97.3% as of the prior year end.

(1) Yields represent interest computed under the effective interest method on a TE basis using the federal income tax rate and the amortized cost of the securities. 

(2) For purposes of the maturity table, MBS, which are not due at a single maturity date, have been included in maturity groupings based on the contractual maturity. The expected life of MBS will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay the underlying mortgage loans.

Lending Activities 

Truist strives to meet the credit needs of its clients while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan profitability, loan growth and loan quality. Management believes that this purpose can best be accomplished by building strong client relationships over time and developing in-depth local market knowledge. Truist's lending process adheres to a consistent company-wide credit culture. The Company employs strict underwriting criteria governing the degree of risk assumed and the diversity of the loan portfolio in terms of type, industry and geographical concentration. 

Truist lends to a diverse client base that is geographically dispersed to mitigate concentration risk arising from local and regional economic downturns. International loans were immaterial as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The following discussion provides additional information on the Company's loan and lease portfolios. Refer to the "Risk Management" section for a discussion of the credit risk management policies used to manage the portfolios. 

Commercial Loan and Lease Portfolio 

&#160; 

Commercial loans and leases represent the largest category of the Company's loan and lease portfolio. C&#38;CB generally targets small-to-middle market businesses with annual sales between $2 million and $500 million, while Truist's commercial banking provides lending solutions to large commercial clients. The commercial loan and lease portfolio consists of lending to public and private business clients and is composed of commercial and industrial, owner occupied, equipment leasing and financing and commercial real estate, as well as government and institutional financing. 

&#160; 

In accordance with the Company's lending policy, each commercial loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process. Commercial loans are typically priced with an interest rate tied to market indices, such as the prime rate or LIBOR and are individually monitored and reviewed for deterioration in the ability of the client to repay the loan. The majority of Truist's commercial loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventories and other types of collateral. 

Residential Mortgage Loan Portfolio 

&#160; 

Truist Bank offers various types of fixed and adjustable-rate loans for the purpose of constructing, purchasing or refinancing residential properties. Truist primarily originates conforming mortgage loans and higher quality jumbo and construction-to-permanent loans for owner-occupied properties. Conforming loans are loans that are underwritten in accordance with the underwriting standards set forth by FNMA and FHLMC. They are generally collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate, typically have loan-to-collateral value ratios of 80% or less at origination, or have mortgage insurance as required by investors and are made to borrowers in good credit standing. 

&#160; 

Risks associated with mortgage lending include interest rate risk, which is mitigated through the sale of a substantial portion of conforming fixed-rate loans in the secondary mortgage market, and an effective MSR hedging process. Credit risk is managed through rigorous underwriting procedures and mortgage insurance. The right to service the loans and receive servicing income is generally retained when conforming loans are sold. Management believes that the retention of mortgage servicing is a relationship driver in retail banking and a part of management's strategy to establish long-term client relationships and offer high quality client service. Truist also purchases residential mortgage loans from correspondent originators. The loans purchased from third-party originators are subject to substantially the same underwriting and risk-management criteria as loans originated internally. 

Residential Home Equity and Direct Loan Portfolio 

&#160; 

The residential home equity and direct loan portfolio is composed of a wide variety of secured and unsecured loans offered through Truist&#8217;s branch network, as well as loans originated by LightStream, Truist&#8217;s national online consumer lending division. Loans originated through the Truist branch network include revolving home equity lines of credit secured by first or second liens on residential real estate and certain other secured and unsecured lending marketed to qualifying clients and other creditworthy candidates in Truist&#8217;s market areas. LightStream provides fixed-rate, unsecured lending to consumers with strong credit through its proprietary online loan origination system. 

Truist Financial Corporation 47 

Indirect Auto Loan Portfolio 

&#160; 

The indirect auto portfolio primarily includes secured indirect installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used automobiles. The indirect auto portfolio also includes nonprime and near prime automobile finance. Such loans are originated through approved franchised and independent dealers throughout the Truist market area and nationally through Regional Acceptance Corporation. These loans are relatively homogeneous and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. Indirect auto loans are subject to rigorous lending policies and procedures and are underwritten with note amounts and credit limits that are consistent with the Company's risk philosophy. In addition to its normal underwriting due diligence, Truist uses application systems and scoring systems to help underwrite and manage the credit risk in its indirect auto portfolio. 

&#160; 

Indirect Other Loan Portfolio 

The indirect other portfolio includes secured indirect installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used boats and recreational vehicles. The indirect other portfolio also includes small ticket consumer lending related to the purchase of power sports equipment. These loans are relatively homogeneous and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. These loans are subject to similar rigorous lending policies and procedures as the indirect auto loan portfolio. The indirect other loan portfolio also includes other indirect lending to consumers to finance home improvements, furniture purchases, and certain elective health-care services. These loans are originated in accordance with strict underwriting criteria as determined by Truist. 

Student Loan Portfolio 

The student loan portfolio is composed of securitized government-guaranteed student loans and certain private student loans originated by third parties. The government guarantee mitigates substantially all of the risk related to principal and interest repayment for this component of the portfolio. Private student loans are purchased from third-party originators with credit enhancements that partially mitigate the Company&#8217;s credit exposure. 

Credit Card Loan Portfolio 

&#160; 

The credit card portfolio consists of the outstanding balances on credit cards. Truist markets credit cards to its existing client base and does not solicit cardholders through nationwide programs or other forms of mass marketing. Such balances are generally unsecured and actively managed. 

PCI 

&#160; 

The PCI balance includes loans acquired with credit deterioration subsequent to origination as well as loans that were formerly covered by loss sharing agreements. Refer to "Note 5. Loans and ACL" for additional information. 

The following table summarizes the loan portfolio:

Loans and leases HFI were $299.8 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $150.8 billion compared to 2018, which was driven primarily by the Merger. LHFS at December 31, 2019 were $8.4 billion, an increase of $7.4 billion compared to the prior year driven by the Merger as well as certain strategic actions which resulted in loans moving to LHFS. At December 31, 2019, there were $2.7 billion in LHFS measured on a nonrecurring basis primarily as a result of these strategic actions. 

The Company has undertaken a number of strategic actions to enhance the credit quality and interest-rate sensitivity of its loan and lease portfolio. During the third quarter of 2019, management sold a $4.3 billion residential mortgage loan portfolio. This sale was followed by a number of balance sheet restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2019, including the transfer of: 

&#8226; $2.5 billion of residential mortgage loans to LHFS; 

&#8226; $356 million of commercial loans to LHFS as a result of a decision to exit a business; and 

&#8226; $381 million of mortgage, consumer and commercial loans to LHFS related to the forthcoming branch divestiture arising from the Merger. 

In addition, $1.4 billion of commercial exposures, of which $516 million were funded, were included in the LHFS portfolio of SunTrust at the Merger date. 

The Merger and the strategic actions highlighted above were the primary drivers of change across the entire loan portfolio. Additional changes include the following: 

&#8226; Commercial and industrial loans increased $1.2 billion due primarily to strong growth in a number of industry verticals and client segments including mortgage warehouse lending, premium finance, dealer floor plan and equipment finance. 

&#8226; Residential mortgage loans decreased $6.2 billion due to the transfer of loans to held for sale and a higher proportion of originations being sold rather than retained in the portfolio. 

Scheduled repayments are reported in the maturity category in which the payment is due. Determinations of maturities are based on contractual terms. Truist's credit policy typically does not permit automatic renewal of loans. At the scheduled maturity date (including balloon payment date), the client generally must request a new loan to replace the matured loan and execute either a new note or note modification with rate, terms and conditions negotiated at that time.

Certain residential mortgage loans have an initial period where the borrower is only required to pay the periodic interest. After the interest-only period, the loan will require the payment of both interest and principal over the remaining term. The outstanding balances of variable rate residential mortgage loans in the interest-only phase were approximately $392 million and $64 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

Average loans held for investment for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $190.2 billion, up $41.6 billion compared to the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to the merged loans. The discussion below only highlights those portfolios where underlying performance was a meaningful driver of the variance. 

Average commercial and industrial loans increased $18.1 billion, with the merged portfolio contributing $18.3 billion of the increase. Excluding the impact of the merged portfolio, commercial and industrial loans declined slightly compared to the prior quarter, as strong growth in mortgage warehouse lending, premium finance and equipment finance were more than offset by paydowns in the corporate banking portfolio. 

Average residential mortgage loans held for investment increased $6.4 billion, primarily due to $7.3 billion of growth from the merged portfolio, partially offset by a decline due to the transfer of loans to held for sale and a higher proportion of loan originations being sold rather than retained in the portfolio. 

Average indirect auto loans increased $3.6 billion over the prior quarter, driven by $3.3 billion of growth from the merged portfolio and $257 million of core portfolio growth.

Nonperforming assets totaled $684 million at December 31, 2019, up $99 million compared to December 31, 2018. This increase was driven by merged loans, which included $107 million and $63 million of loans classified as HFS and HFI, respectively, and $63 million of other nonperforming assets. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in nonperforming residential mortgages loans as a result of loan sales. 

Nonperforming loans and leases held for investment represented 0.15% of loans and leases HFI, down 20 basis points compared to December 31, 2018. The decline was due primarily to the impact of the merged nonperforming loans being accounted for on a pooled basis in PCI and the sale of nonperforming mortgage loans during the year. Upon adoption of CECL and the transition from pooled level accounting for PCI, nonperforming loans will be identified based on the loan-level characteristics and reported accordingly. There are approximately $500 million of PCI loans that would be classified as nonperforming as of December 31, 2019. 

Performing TDRs were down $139 million compared to the prior year, which was driven by a decrease in residential mortgage loans due to the previously discussed sale that was partially offset by increases in commercial construction loans and indirect auto. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing totaled $2.0 billion at December 31, 2019, up $1.5 billion compared to the prior year. This increase is a result of merged loans, including $1.2 billion of PCI loans, $193 million of government guaranteed residential mortgages and $188 million of government guaranteed student loans. The ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.66% at December 31, 2019, an increase of 35 basis points from the prior year. Excluding government guaranteed and PCI loans, the ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.03% at December 31, 2019, down from 0.04% at December 31, 2018. 

Loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing totaled $2.2 billion at December 31, 2019, up $1.2 billion compared to the prior year, due primarily to the merged portfolio that added $1.2 billion. The ratio of loans 30-89 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.74% at December 31, 2019, an increase of four basis points from the prior year. The primary driver of the increase is the addition of the merged guaranteed student loan portfolio. 

Problem loans include NPLs and loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing as disclosed in Table 15. In addition, for the commercial portfolio segment, loans that are rated special mention or substandard performing are closely monitored by management as potential problem loans. Refer to "Note 5. Loans and ACL" for additional disclosures related to these potential problem loans.

(2) This asset quality ratio has been adjusted to remove the impact of government guaranteed mortgage and student loans and PCI. Management believes the inclusion of such assets in this asset quality ratio results in distortion of this ratio such that it might not be reflective of asset collectability or might not be comparable to other periods presented or to other portfolios that do not have government guarantees or were not impacted by PCI accounting requirements.

TDRs occur when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties in the near term and a concession has been granted to the borrower. As a result, Truist will work with the borrower to prevent further difficulties and seek to improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan. To facilitate this process, a concessionary modification that would not otherwise be considered may be granted, resulting in classification of the loan as a TDR. 

TDRs identified by SunTrust prior to the Merger date are not included in Truist's TDR disclosure because all such loans were recorded at fair value and a new accounting basis was established as of the Merger. Subsequent modifications will be evaluated and recorded as TDRs in accordance with Truist's accounting policies. 

The following table provides a summary of performing TDR activity: 

##TABLE_START Table 18: Rollforward of Performing TDRs (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Balance, January 1 $ 1,119 &#160; $ 1,043 &#160; Inflows 641 &#160; 510 &#160; Payments and payoffs (199) &#160; (169) &#160; Charge-offs (67) &#160; (63) &#160; Transfers to nonperforming TDRs (77) &#160; (69) &#160; Removal due to the passage of time (18) &#160; (32) &#160; Non-concessionary re-modifications (8) &#160; (6) &#160; Transferred to LHFS and/or sold (411) &#160; (95) &#160; Balance, December 31 $ 980 &#160; $ 1,119 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Payments and payoffs include scheduled principal payments, prepayments and payoffs of amounts outstanding. Transfers to nonperforming TDRs represent loans that no longer meet the requirements necessary to reflect the loan in accruing status. 

TDR classification may be removed due to the passage of time if the loan: (1) did not include a forgiveness of principal or interest, (2) has performed in accordance with the modified terms (generally a minimum of six months), (3) was reported as a TDR over a year-end reporting period, and (4) reflected an interest rate on the modified loan that was no less than a market rate at the date of modification. TDR classification may also be removed for an accruing loan upon the occurrence of a subsequent non-concessionary modification granted at market terms and within current underwriting guidelines. 

In connection with consumer TDRs, a NPL will be returned to accruing status when current as to principal and interest and upon a sustained historical repayment performance (generally a minimum of six months).

The ACL consists of the ALLL, which is presented separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the RUFC, which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The ACL totaled $1.9 billion at December 31, 2019, up $238 million compared to December 31, 2018. The RUFC assumed in the Merger was $257 million. 

Total charge-offs during the year totaled $789 million, up $111 million compared to the prior year. As a percentage of average loans and leases, annualized net charge-offs were 0.40 percent, up four basis points compared to the prior year. 

The ALLL, excluding the allowance for PCI loans, was $1.5 billion, down $8 million compared to the prior year. The decrease in the ALLL was due primarily to the sale of residential mortgage loans during the year. As of December 31, 2019, the total ALLL was 0.52 percent of loans and leases held for investment. All of the merged loans were marked to fair value as of December 6, 2019 and therefore, there is no allowance related to these loans. Upon the adoption of CECL, an allowance will be established for all loans held for investment, with the portion related to non-PCI loans and leases charged to retained earnings. 

Truist Financial Corporation 55 

The ALLL was 3.41 times nonperforming loans and leases held for investment, compared to 2.99 times at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, the ALLL was 2.44 times annualized net charge-offs, compared to 2.98 times at December 31, 2018. 

The following table presents an allocation of the ALLL at the periods shown. This allocation of the ALLL is calculated on an approximate basis and is not necessarily indicative of future losses or allocations. The entire amount of the allowance is available to absorb losses occurring in any category of loans and leases.

Truist monitors the performance of its home equity loans and lines secured by second liens similarly to other consumer loans and utilizes assumptions specific to these loans in determining the necessary ALLL. Truist also receives notification when the first lien holder, whether Truist or another financial institution, has initiated foreclosure proceedings against the borrower. When notified that the first lien is in the process of foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to determine if any additional charge-offs or reserves are warranted. These valuations are updated at least annually thereafter. 

&#160; 

Truist has limited ability to monitor the delinquency status of the first lien, unless the first lien is held or serviced by Truist. As a result, using migration assumptions that are based on historical experience and adjusted for current trends, Truist estimates the volume of second lien positions where the first lien is delinquent and adjusts the ALLL to reflect the increased risk of loss on these credits. Finally, Truist also provides additional reserves for second lien positions when the estimated combined current loan to value ratio for the credit exceeds 100%. As of December 31, 2019, Truist held or serviced the first lien on 30.9% of its second lien positions.

Funding Activities 

Deposits are the primary source of funds for the Company's lending and investing activities. Scheduled payments and maturities from portfolios of loans and investment securities also provide a stable source of funds. FHLB advances, other secured borrowings, Federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowed funds, as well as long-term debt issued through the capital markets, all provide supplemental liquidity sources. Funding activities are monitored and governed through Truist's overall ALM process under the governance and oversight of the MRLCC, which is further discussed in the "Market Risk Management" section in MD&#38;A. The following section provides a brief description of the various sources of funds. 

Truist Financial Corporation 57 

Deposits 

Deposits are obtained principally from individuals and businesses within Truist's branch network and include noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, CDs and IRAs. Deposit account terms vary with respect to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and service charge schedules. Interest rates paid on specific deposit types are determined based on (i) competitor deposit rates, (ii) the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs, (iii) the availability and cost of alternative sources of funding, and (iv) anticipated future economic conditions and interest rates. Deposits are attractive sources of funding because of their stability and relative cost. 

Deposits totaled $334.7 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $173.5 billion from December 31, 2018, due primarily to the Merger, which contributed $170.7 billion of deposits. 

The following table presents average deposits for the most recent calendar quarters:

Borrowings 

The types of short-term borrowings that have been, or may be, used by the Company include Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, master notes, commercial paper, short-term bank notes and short-term FHLB advances. Short-term borrowings fluctuate based on the Company's funding needs. While deposits remain the primary source for funding loan originations, management uses short-term borrowings as a supplementary funding source for loan growth and other balance sheet management purposes. The following table summarizes certain information for the past three years with respect to short-term borrowings:

At December 31, 2019, short-term borrowings totaled $18.2 billion, an increase of $13.0 billion compared to December 31, 2018. Short-term borrowings of $6.8 billion were assumed as a result of the Merger. The remaining increase was due to increased liquidity in anticipation of the Merger. Average short-term borrowings were $8.5 billion, or 4.0% of total funding in 2019, as compared to $6.0 billion, or 3.1% in 2018. 

Long-term debt provides funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital, and primarily consists of senior and subordinated notes issued by Truist and Truist Bank. Long-term debt totaled $41.3 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $17.6 billion compared to December 31, 2018. Long-term debt of $19.5 billion was assumed as a result of the Merger. Truist's issuances of debt included $3.5 billion of senior notes and $650 million of subordinated notes, partially offset by maturities of $3.1 billion of senior notes and $586 million of subordinated notes. Truist Bank's issuances included $1.2 billion of senior notes and $750 million of subordinated notes, partially offset by maturities of $4.7 billion of senior notes. The average cost of long-term debt was 3.22% for the year ended December 31, 2019, up 34 basis points compared to the same period in 2018. 

FHLB advances represented 10.0% of total outstanding long-term debt at December 31, 2019, compared to 7.4% at December 31, 2018. See "Note 11. Borrowings" for additional disclosures. 

Shareholders' Equity 

Total shareholders' equity was $66.6 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $36.4 billion from December 31, 2018. Equity issued in connection with the Merger was $33.5 billion. Truist issued $1.7 billion of preferred stock during the year and redeemed a similar amount from two higher-cost issuances. In connection with the redemptions, net income available to common shareholders was reduced by $46 million to recognize the difference in the redemption price and the carrying value. Other significant changes include net income of $3.2 billion and an increase in AOCI of $871 million, which was partially offset by $1.5 billion for common and preferred dividends. Truist's book value per common share at December 31, 2019 was $45.66, compared to $35.46 at December 31, 2018. 

Risk Management 

Truist maintains a comprehensive risk management framework supported by people, processes and systems to identify, measure, monitor, manage and report significant risks arising from its exposures and business activities. Effective risk management involves appropriately managing risk to optimize risk and return, operate in a safe and sound manner, and is designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Company&#8217;s risk management framework is designed to ensure that business strategies and objectives are executed in alignment with its risk appetite. 

Truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports transparency and escalation of risks across the organization. All teammates are responsible for upholding the Company&#8217;s purpose, mission, and values, and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the Company&#8217;s culture. The Truist code of ethics guides and unites the Company&#8217;s decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance. 

Truist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations. Risk-taking activities are evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive risk-adjusted returns, while preserving asset value and capital. 

Compensation decisions take into account a teammate's adherence to, and successful implementation of, Truist's risk values and associated policies and procedures. The Company's compensation structure supports its core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risk-taking behavior. 

Truist Financial Corporation 59 

Truist employs a comprehensive change management program to manage the risks associated with integrating heritage BB&#38;T and heritage SunTrust. The Board and Executive Leadership oversee the change management program, which is designed to ensure key decisions are reviewed and that there is appropriate oversight of integration activities. 

Truist's purpose, mission and values are the foundation for the risk management framework utilized at Truist and therefore serve as the basis on which the risk appetite and risk strategy are built. Truist's RMO provides independent oversight and guidance for risk-taking across the enterprise. In keeping with the belief that consistent values drive long-term behaviors, Truist's RMO has established the following risk values which guide teammates&#8217; day-to-day activities: 

&#8226; Managing risk is the responsibility of every teammate. 

&#8226; Proactively identifying risk and managing the inherent risks of their businesses is the responsibility of the business units. 

&#8226; Managing risk with a balanced approach which includes quality, profitability, and growth. 

&#8226; Measuring what is managed and managing what is measured. 

&#8226; Utilizing sound and consistent risk management practices. 

&#8226; Thoroughly analyzing risk quantitatively and qualitatively. 

&#8226; Realizing lower cost of capital from high quality risk management. 

Truist places significant emphasis on risk management oversight and maintains a separate Board-level Risk Committee, which assists the Board in its oversight of the Company&#8217;s risk management function. The Committee is responsible for approving and periodically reviewing the Company&#8217;s risk management framework and risk management policies as well as monitoring the Company&#8217;s risk profile, approving risk appetite statements, and providing input to management regarding Truist's risk appetite and risk profile. 

The RMO is led by the CRO and is responsible for overseeing the identification, measurement, monitoring, management and reporting of risk. The CRO has direct access to the Board to communicate any risk issues (current or emerging) as well as the performance of the risk management activities throughout the enterprise. 

As illustrated below, the risk management framework is supported by three lines of defense. The following figure describes the roles of the three lines of defense: 

Truist&#8217;s Risk Governance framework is designed to provide comprehensive Board and Executive Leadership risk oversight, maintaining a committee governance structure that is designed to ensure alignment and execution of the risk management framework. The committee structure provides a mechanism to allow for efficient aggregation and escalation of risk information from the BUs up to the risk programs, Executive Leadership and ultimately the Board. 

60 Truist Financial Corporation 

The executive level committees include the ERC, ECRPMC, MRLCC, EBPCC, TMC and DC, each of which is chaired by a member of Executive Leadership. These committees provide oversight of each of the primary risk types. 

The ERC establishes a fully integrated view of risks across the company, provides broad strategic oversight of all risk types, and oversees corporate-wide strategies for identifying, assessing, controlling, measuring, monitoring and reporting risk at the enterprise level. 

The ERC is responsible for maintaining an effective risk management framework and monitoring its adoption and execution across the enterprise. The ERC is chaired by the CRO and its membership includes all members of Executive Leadership and the General Auditor. 

The principal types of inherent risk include credit, liquidity, compliance, strategic and reputation, operational, and market risks. The following is a discussion of these risks. 

Credit risk 

Credit risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from the default, inability or unwillingness of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty to meet the terms of any financial obligation to Truist or otherwise perform as agreed. Credit risk exists in all activities where success depends on the performance of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty. Credit risk arises when Truist funds are extended, committed, invested, or otherwise exposed through actual or implied contractual agreements, whether on or off-balance sheet. Credit risk increases when the credit quality of an issuer whose securities or other instruments the bank holds deteriorates. 

Truist has established the following general practices to manage credit risk: 

&#8226; limiting the amount of credit that individual lenders may extend to a borrower; 

&#8226; establishing a process for credit approval accountability; 

&#8226; careful initial underwriting and analysis of borrower, transaction, market and collateral risks; 

&#8226; ongoing servicing and monitoring of individual loans and lending relationships; 

&#8226; continuous monitoring of the portfolio, market dynamics and the economy; and 

&#8226; periodically reevaluating the Company's strategy and overall exposure as economic, market and other relevant conditions change. 

The following discussion describes the underwriting procedures and overall risk management of Truist's lending function. 

Truist Financial Corporation 61 

Underwriting Approach 

&#160; 

The loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk; therefore, proper loan underwriting is critical to Truist's long-term financial success. Truist's underwriting approach is designed to define acceptable combinations of specific risk-mitigating features that ensure credit relationships conform to Truist's risk philosophy. Provided below is a summary of the most significant underwriting criteria used to evaluate new loans and loan renewals: 

&#8226; Cash flow and debt service coverage - cash flow adequacy is a necessary condition of creditworthiness, meaning that loans must either be clearly supported by a borrower's cash flow or, if not, must be justified by secondary repayment sources. 

&#8226; Secondary sources of repayment - alternative repayment funds are a significant risk-mitigating factor as long as they are liquid, can be easily accessed, and provide adequate resources to supplement the primary cash flow source. 

&#8226; Value of any underlying collateral - loans are generally secured by the asset being financed. Because an analysis of the primary and secondary sources of repayment is the most important factor, collateral, unless it is liquid, does not justify loans that cannot be serviced by the borrower's normal cash flows. 

&#8226; Overall creditworthiness of the client, taking into account the client's relationships, both past and current, with Truist and other lenders - Truist's success depends on building lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with clients, which involves assessing their financial position and background. 

&#8226; Level of equity invested in the transaction - in general, borrowers are required to contribute or invest a portion of their own funds prior to any loan advances. 

Refer to the "Lending Activities" section in this MD&#38;A for a discussion of each loan and lease portfolio. 

Liquidity risk 

Liquidity risk is the risk that (i) Truist will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding (funding liquidity risk), or (ii) Truist cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions (market liquidity risk). 

Compliance risk 

Compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures or ethical standards. This risk exposes Truist to fines, civil monetary penalties, payment of damages and the voiding of contracts. Compliance risk can result in diminished reputation, reduced franchise or enterprise value, limited business opportunities and lessened expansion potential. 

Operational risk 

Operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. It includes legal risk, which is the risk of loss arising from defective transactions, litigation or claims made, or the failure to adequately protect company-owned assets. An operational loss occurs when an event results in a loss or reserve originating from operational risk. 

Truist has developed and employs a risk taxonomy that further guides business functions in identifying, measuring, responding to, monitoring and reporting on possible operational losses to the organization. The risk taxonomy drives internal risk conversations and enables Truist to clearly and transparently communicate to external stakeholders the level of potential operational risk we face, both presently and in the future, and our position on managing it to acceptable levels. 

Technology risk 

Technology risk is the business risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of information technology across the Company. Truist has defined and adopted a technology risk framework that provides the foundation for technology risk strategy, program and oversight and defines key objectives, operating model components, risk domains and capabilities to manage this risk. 

Cybersecurity risk 

Digital technology is constantly evolving, and new and unforeseen threats and actions by others may disrupt operations or result in losses beyond Truist&#8217;s risk control thresholds. Truist maintains a comprehensive risk-based information security / cybersecurity framework implemented through people, processes, and technology whereby Truist monitors and evaluates threats, events, and the performance of its business operations and continually adapts its risk mitigation activities accordingly. 

62 Truist Financial Corporation 

Truist's framework aligns with those of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the International Standards Organization 27000 series, the IT Governance Institute, and the Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology, as well as conforms with the requirements and guidance from applicable regulatory authorities, including the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. In addition, Truist&#8217;s risk-based information security / cybersecurity framework, which includes internally and externally focused capabilities, drives the development and implementation of Truist&#8217;s holistic data security strategy that is designed to reduce risk while enabling Truist&#8217;s corporate business objectives. 

Truist has built an organization with dedicated, skilled talent to sustain the cross-company partnerships needed to operationalize Truist&#8217;s cybersecurity strategy as well as to continue enhancing multilayered defenses pertaining to early and rapid cyber threat identification, detection, protection, response, and recovery by identifying and deploying advanced capabilities best suited to help proactively prevent and mitigate risk. Truist also participates in the federally recognized financial sector information sharing organization structure, known as the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center as a key part of Truist&#8217;s cyber threat intelligence and response programs, as well as other industry organizations and initiatives that promote industry best practices such as harmonized cybersecurity standards, cyber readiness, and secure consumer financial data sharing. 

To further mitigate the risks presented by an evolving cyber threat landscape, Truist provides data protection guidance to clients through multiple print and digital channels as well as promotes data protection awareness and accountability through robust training for teammates. Truist conducts routine test simulation exercises which are scenario driven and simulate impacts and consequences developed through analysis of real-world technology incidents as well as known and anticipated cyber threats. These exercises are designed to assess the viability of Truist&#8217;s crisis response and management programs and provide the basis for continuous improvement. Truist also consults with third party data security experts. 

Truist&#8217;s cybersecurity risk program is overseen by the Board and Executive Leadership. The Board devotes significant time and attention to its oversight of cyber security risk and approves related information security policies. Although Truist has invested substantial time and resources to manage and reduce cyber risk, it is not possible to completely eliminate this risk. Truist obtains cyber security insurance that protects against certain losses, expenses, and damages associated with cyber risk. See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; for additional information regarding cybersecurity risk. 

Model risk 

Model risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. Truist uses models for many purposes, including the valuation of financial positions, estimation of credit losses, and the measurement of risk. Valuation models are used to value certain financial instruments for which quoted prices may not be readily available. Valuation models are also used as inputs for VaR, the estimation of VaR itself, regulatory capital, stress testing and the ACL. Models are owned by the applicable BUs, who are responsible for the development, implementation and use of their models. Oversight of these functions is performed by the MRM, which is a component of the RMO. Once models have been approved, model owners are responsible for the maintenance of an appropriate operating environment and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on a recurring basis. Models are updated in response to changes in portfolio composition, industry and economic conditions, technological capabilities and other developments. 

MRM manages model risk in a holistic manner through a suite of model governance and model validation activities. The risk of each model is assessed and classified into various risk tiers. Additionally, MRM maintains an enterprise-wide model inventory containing relevant model information. Regarding model validation, MRM utilizes internal validation analysts and managers with skill sets in predictive modeling to perform detailed reviews of model development, implementation and conceptual soundness. On certain occasions, the MRM will also engage external parties to assist with validation efforts. Once in a production environment, MRM assesses a model&#8217;s performance on a periodic basis through ongoing monitoring reviews. MRM tracks issues that have been identified during model validation or through ongoing monitoring, and engages with model owners to ensure their timely remediation. MRM presents model limitations and risks to management and the Board of Directors via model validation reports and regular meetings with the Model Risk Management Committee. 

Truist Financial Corporation 63 

Strategic and reputation risk 

Strategic risk is the risk of financial loss, diminished stakeholder confidence, or negative impact to human capital resulting from ineffective strategy setting and execution, adverse business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. Truist is committed to fulfilling its overall strategic objectives by selecting business strategies and operating businesses in a manner consistent with achieving profitability/earnings growth and maintaining strong confidence and trust with its key stakeholder constituencies. 

Reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, enterprise value, the Truist brand, and public confidence arising from negative publicity or public opinion, whether real or perceived, regarding Truist's business practices, products, services, transactions, or other activities undertaken by Truist, its representatives, or its partners. A negative reputation may impair Truist's relationship with clients, associates, communities or shareholders, and it is often a residual risk that arises when other risks are not managed properly. 

Market risk management 

Market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from changes in the market value of portfolios, securities, or other financial instruments. Market risk results from changes in the level, volatility or correlations among financial market rates or prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices or other relevant rates or prices. 

Effective management of market risk is essential to achieving Truist's strategic financial objectives. Truist's most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet; however, market risk also results from product liquidity risk, price risk and volatility risk in Truist's BUs. Interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (re-pricing risk); from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related options embedded in bank products (options risk). 

&#160; 

The primary objectives of market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income, net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. At Truist, market risk management also includes the enterprise-wide IPV function. 

&#160; 

Interest rate market risk (other than trading) 

As a financial institution, Truist is exposed to interest rate risk both on its assets and on its liabilities. Since interest rate changes are out of the control of any private sector institution, Truist actively manages its interest rate risk with the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities, taking into account the volumes, maturities and mix, with the goal of keeping net interest margin as stable as possible. Truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk: (i) a model that simulates possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on a set of assumptions; (ii) an analysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and (iii) a model that analyzes the economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates. 

The simulation model takes into account assumptions about prepayment trends, using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans, as well as scheduled maturities and payments and the likely outlook for the economy and interest rates. These assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in market interest rates as compared to the rates of Truist&#8217;s assets and liabilities. The model also considers Truist's current and prospective liquidity position, current balance sheet volumes and projected growth, accessibility of funds for short-term needs and capital maintenance. 

Deposit betas are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process. Truist applies an average deposit beta (the difference between rates Truist pays and market rates) of approximately 60% to its non-maturity interest-bearing deposit accounts for determining its interest rate sensitivity. Non-maturity, interest-bearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts, savings accounts and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity. Truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables, including noninterest-bearing deposits, to determine the impact they could have on the interest rate risk position. The predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions, but management believes that it provides helpful data for the management of interest rate risk.

The following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next twelve months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below. The decrease in rate sensitivity versus the prior period is related to the Merger, alignment of modeling assumptions and recent balance sheet restructuring activities.

Truist has established parameters related to interest rate sensitivity measures that prescribe a maximum impact on net interest income under different interest rate scenarios that would result in an escalation to the Board. The following parameters and interest rate scenarios are considered Truist's primary measures of interest rate risk: 

&#8226; Maximum impact on net interest income of 7.5% for the next 12 months assuming a 25 basis point change in interest rates each quarter for four quarters; and a 

&#8226; Maximum impact on net interest income of 10% for an immediate 100 basis point parallel change in rates. 

This interest rate shock analysis is designed to create an outer bound of acceptable interest rate risk. 

Truist also uses an EVE analysis to focus on longer-term projected changes in asset and liability values given potential changes in interest rates. This measure allows Truist to analyze interest rate risk that falls outside the simulation model parameters. The EVE model is a discounted cash flow of the portfolio of assets, liabilities and derivative instruments. The difference in the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities is defined as EVE. 

The following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on EVE: 

##TABLE_START Table 27: EVE Simulation Analysis Change in Interest Rates (bps) Hypothetical Percentage Change in EVE Dec 31, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 Up 100 (2.9) % (0.7) % No Change &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Down 100 (3.0) &#160; (6.2) &#160; ##TABLE_END

Truist uses derivatives primarily to manage interest rate risk related to securities, commercial loans, MSRs and mortgage banking operations, long-term debt and other funding sources. Truist also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients. As of December 31, 2019, Truist had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling $315.9 billion, with a net fair value of $1.7 billion. See "Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments" for additional disclosures. 

LIBOR in its current form may no longer be available after 2021. Truist has LIBOR-based contracts that extend beyond 2021. To prepare for the possible transition to an alternative reference rate, management has formed a cross-functional project team to address the LIBOR transition. The project team has performed an assessment to identify the potential risks related to the transition from LIBOR to a new index. The project provides regular reports to the Board and Risk Management Committees. 

The project team is reviewing contract fallback language for loans and leases and noted that certain contracts will need updated provisions for the transition and is coordinating with impacted lines of business to update LIBOR fallback language generally consistent with the ARRC recommendation. Truist is continuing to evaluate the impact on these contracts and other financial instruments, systems implications, hedging strategies, and other related operational and market risks. Market risks associated with this change are dependent on the alternative reference rates available and market conditions at transition. For a further discussion of the various risks associated with the potential cessation of LIBOR and the transition to alternative reference rates, refer to the section titled "Item 1A. Risk Factors."

Market risk from trading activities 

&#160; 

Truist also manages market risk associated with trading activities. Truist is a financial intermediary that provides its clients access to derivatives, foreign exchange and securities markets. Trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach, which includes measuring risk using VaR, stress testing and sensitivity analysis. Risk metrics are monitored against limits on a daily basis at both trading desks and at the aggregate portfolio level to ensure exposures are in line with Truist's risk appetite. 

Truist is subject to risk-based capital guidelines for market risk under the Market Risk Rule, issued jointly by the OCC, U.S. Treasury FRB and FDIC. 

Covered trading positions 

The trading portfolio of covered positions subject to the Market Risk Rule results primarily from market making and underwriting services for our clients, as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity. The trading portfolio, measured in terms of VaR, consists primarily of four sub-portfolios of covered positions: (i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income securities, (iii) interest rate derivatives and (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker, Truist&#8217;s trading portfolio also contains other sub-portfolios, including foreign exchange rate and commodity derivatives; however, these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures. 

Valuation policies, procedures, and methodologies exist for all covered positions. Additionally, trading positions are subject to independent price verification. See "Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments,&#8221; "Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures,&#8221; and &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; herein for discussion of valuation policies, procedures and methodologies. 

Securitizations 

As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate market value of on-balance sheet securitization positions subject to the Market Risk Rule was $23 million, all of which were non-agency asset backed securities positions. Consistent with the Market Risk Rule requirements, the Company performs pre-purchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including, but not limited to, deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets, that materially affect valuation and performance. Securitization positions are subject to Truist&#8217;s comprehensive risk management framework, which includes daily monitoring against a full suite of limits. There were no off-balance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period. 

Correlation trading positions 

The trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of December 31, 2019 or 2018. 

VaR-based measures 

VaR measures the estimated potential loss at a specified confidence level and time horizon. Truist utilizes a historical VaR methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions. Following the Merger, Truist elected to migrate all covered positions to the heritage SunTrust VaR system and methodology. For an interim period, VaR for a subset of heritage BB&#38;T positions, specifically those covered positions held in BB&#38;T Securities, will be calculated using the heritage BB&#38;T VaR system and methodology. As such, pending full integration, Truist will operate two historical VaR models and aggregate company-wide VaR will be determined additively with no benefit of diversification. For risk management purposes, the VaR calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a one-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the Company calculates VaR using a 10-day holding period and a 99% confidence level. Due to inherent limitations of the VaR methodology, such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance, VaR is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk. Other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing, profit and loss attribution, and stop loss limits. 

66 Truist Financial Corporation 

The trading portfolio&#8217;s VaR profile is influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and composition of the portfolio, market volatility and the correlation between different positions. The following table summarizes certain VaR-based measures. VaR measures at December 31, 2019 reflects the aggregate VaR measure of the Truist trading portfolio. Average VaR measures reflect heritage SunTrust after the Merger.

Stressed VaR-based measures 

Stressed VaR, another component of market risk capital, is calculated using the same internal models as used for the VaR-based measure. Stressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level and employs a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelve-month historical window selected to reflect a period of significant financial stress for our trading portfolio. The following table summarizes Stressed VaR-based measures: 

##TABLE_START Table 29: Stressed VaR-based Measures - 10 Day Holding Period Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Maximum $ 33 &#160; $ 7 &#160; Average 5 &#160; 5 &#160; Minimum 2 &#160; 3 &#160; Period-end 28 &#160; 5 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Specific risk measures 

Specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements (e.g. default, event risks). The Market Risk Rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a model-based approach, subject to regulatory approval. Truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital. As such, incremental risk capital and comprehensive risk measure capital requirements do not apply. 

VaR model backtesting 

In accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the Company evaluates the accuracy of its VaR model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) from covered positions with the corresponding daily VaR-based measures generated by the model. The number of company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the VaR-based capital requirement under the Market Risk Rule. The capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four, depending on the number of exceptions. There were two company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. In accordance with established policy and procedure, all company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of VaR model use and performance. There was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months. 

Truist Financial Corporation 67 

Model risk management 

Management's approach to the validation and evaluation of the accuracy of Truist's models, and associated processes, includes conceptual soundness, developmental and implementation testing as well as outcomes analysis, ongoing monitoring and maintenance performed by the various model developers, in conjunction with model owners. 

MRM is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models. The validation activities are conducted in accordance with MRM standards, which includes regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness, ongoing monitoring and outcomes analysis. As part of ongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets, assess evolving modeling approaches, and to identify potential model enhancement. 

Stress testing 

The Company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily VaR and other risk limits reporting. The stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme, but plausible, stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses. Stress tests include simulations for historical repeats and hypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading positions within each applicable market risk category (interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange rate risk, credit spread risk, and commodity price risk) are included in the Company's comprehensive stress testing framework. Management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates, as necessary, to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately. Management also utilizes stress analyses to support the Company&#8217;s capital adequacy assessment standards. See the &#8220;Capital&#8221; section of this MD&#38;A for additional discussion of capital adequacy. 

Liquidity 

&#160; 

Liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs, including deposit withdrawals, timely repayment of borrowings and other liabilities, and funding of loan commitments. In addition to the level of liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents and AFS securities, other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including access to a variety of funding sources, maintaining borrowing capacity in national money markets, growing core deposits, loan repayment and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale. 

Truist monitors the ability to meet client demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions. In considering its liquidity position, management evaluates Truist's funding mix based on client core funding, client rate-sensitive funding and national markets funding. In addition, management evaluates exposure to rate-sensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less. Management also measures liquidity needs against 30 days of stressed cash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To ensure a strong liquidity position, and compliance with regulatory requirements, management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, Truist's liquid asset buffer was 16.5% and 14.7%, respectively, of total assets. 

LCR rules require large U.S. banking organizations to hold unencumbered high-quality liquid assets sufficient to withstand projected 30-day total net cash outflows, each as defined under the LCR rule. As of December 31, 2019, Truist is subject to modified LCR requirements. Truist's modified average LCR was 165% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, relative to the regulatory minimum for such entities of 100%. This represents the month-end results for heritage BB&#38;T from October and November 2019 averaged with the merged Truist result for December 2019. 

Under the Tailoring Rules, Truist is a Category III banking organization, and therefore is subject to a reduced tailored LCR requirement (85%) effective January 1, 2020 and will be subject to daily calculation beginning January 1, 2021. See additional disclosures in the "Regulatory Considerations" section in this MD&#38;A. 

Parent Company 

&#160; 

The Parent Company serves as the primary source of capital for the operating subsidiaries. The Parent Company's assets consist primarily of cash on deposit with Truist Bank, equity investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and accounts receivable from subsidiaries. The principal obligations of the Parent Company are payments on long-term debt. The main sources of funds for the Parent Company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries, repayments of advances to subsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance of equity and long-term debt. The primary uses of funds by the Parent Company are investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders, retirement of common stock, and payments on long-term debt. 

See "Note 22. Parent Company Financial Information" for additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions. 

68 Truist Financial Corporation 

Access to funding at the Parent Company is more sensitive to market disruptions. Therefore, Truist prudently manages cash levels at the Parent Company to cover a minimum of one year of projected cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments, debt service, common and preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities, without the benefit of any new cash inflows. Truist maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of cash outflows. In determining the buffer, Truist considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates, serving as a source of strength to Truist Bank, and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital markets. At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Parent Company had 29 months and 28 months, respectively, of cash on hand to satisfy projected contractual cash outflows, and 20 months and 19 months, respectively, when including the payment of common stock dividends. 

Truist Bank 

&#160; 

Truist carefully manages liquidity risk at Truist Bank. Truist Bank's primary source of funding is client deposits. Continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of Truist Bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested. 

Truist Bank has several major sources of funding to meet its liquidity requirements, including access to capital markets through issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes and institutional CDs, FHLB advances, repurchase agreements, overnight and term Federal funds markets, retail brokered CDs, and the FRB discount window. At December 31, 2019, Truist Bank has approximately $121.8 billion of secured borrowing capacity, which represents approximately 3.4 times the amount of one year wholesale funding maturities. 

The ability to raise funding at competitive prices is affected by the rating agencies' views of the Parent Company's and Truist Bank's credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings. Management meets with the rating agencies on a regular basis to discuss current outlooks. The ratings for Truist and Truist Bank by the major rating agencies are detailed in the table below:

Truist has a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in the event of a liquidity contraction. This plan is designed to examine and quantify the organization's liquidity under various "stress" scenarios. Additionally, the plan provides a framework for management and other critical personnel to follow in the event of a liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event. The plan addresses authority for activation and decision making, liquidity options, and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction. 

Management believes current sources of liquidity are adequate to meet Truist's current requirements and plans for continued growth. See "Note 9. Other Assets and Liabilities," "Note 11. Borrowings" and "Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information regarding outstanding balances of sources of liquidity and contractual commitments and obligations.

Capital 

&#160; 

The maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. Truist's principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support Truist's risk profile consistent with the Board-approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve optimal credit ratings for Truist and its subsidiaries and provide a competitive return to shareholders. Risk-based capital ratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets. 

70 Truist Financial Corporation 

Truist regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to periodically submit the Company's capital plans and stress testing results to the banking regulators. Management regularly monitors the capital position of Truist on both a consolidated and bank-level basis. In this regard, management's overriding policy is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of internal capital targets, which are above the regulatory "well capitalized" minimums. Management has implemented stressed capital ratio minimum targets to evaluate whether capital ratios calculated after the effect of alternative capital actions are likely to remain above minimums specified by the FRB for the annual CCAR process. Breaches of stressed minimum targets prompt a review of the planned capital actions included in Truist's capital plan.

(1) The Truist targets are subject to revision based on finalization of pending regulatory guidance and other strategic factors. 

(2) Truist's goal is to maintain capital levels above all regulatory minimums. 

While nonrecurring events or management decisions may result in the Company temporarily falling below its operating minimum guidelines for one or more of these ratios, it is management's intent to return to these targeted operating minimums within a reasonable period of time through capital planning. Such temporary decreases below the operating minimums shown above are not considered an infringement of Truist's overall capital policy, provided a return above the minimums is forecasted to occur within a reasonable time period. 

Payments of cash dividends and repurchases of common shares are the methods used to manage any excess capital generated. In addition, management closely monitors the Parent Company's double leverage ratio (investments in subsidiaries as a percentage of shareholders' equity). The active management of the subsidiaries' equity capital, as described above, is the process used to manage this important driver of Parent Company liquidity and is a key element in the management of Truist's capital position. 

Management intends to maintain capital at Truist Bank at levels that will result in classification as "well-capitalized" for regulatory purposes. Secondarily, it is management's intent to maintain Truist Bank's capital at levels that result in regulatory risk-based capital ratios that are generally comparable with peers of similar size, complexity and risk profile. If the capital levels of Truist Bank increase above these guidelines, excess capital may be transferred to the Parent Company in the form of special dividend payments, subject to regulatory and other operating considerations. 

&#160; 

Management's capital deployment plan in order of preference is to focus on (i) organic growth, (ii) dividends, and (iii) strategic opportunities and/or share repurchases depending on opportunities in the marketplace and Truist's interest and ability to proceed with acquisitions. Truist has suspended share repurchases until capital ratios return to higher levels.

(1) Tangible common equity and related measures are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets, net of deferred taxes, and their related amortization. These measures are useful for evaluating the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or developed internally. Truist's management uses these measures to assess the quality of capital and returns relative to balance sheet risk and believes investors may find them useful in their analysis of the Corporation. These capital measures are not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be presented by other companies. 

During 2019,Truist paid $1.3 billion in common stock dividends, which resulted in a total payout ratio of 43.2% for the year. 

Truist's Board increased the dividend by $0.045 during 2019, which increased the amount of the quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share. As previously communicated, Truist suspended its share repurchase program until capital ratios return to higher levels.

Fourth Quarter Results 

&#160; 

Total taxable-equivalent revenues were $3.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $686 million compared to the earlier quarter, which reflects an increase of $523 million in taxable-equivalent net interest income and an increase of $163 million in noninterest income. 

Net interest margin was 3.41%, down eight basis points compared to the earlier quarter. Average earning assets increased $65.9 billion. The increase in average earning assets reflects a $45.2 billion increase in average total loans and leases and a $14.1 billion increase in average securities. Average interest earning trading assets and other earning assets increased $6.6 billion due to higher trading securities and interest-bearing balances at the Federal Reserve. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $53.0 billion compared to the earlier quarter. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $42.1 billion, average long-term debt increased $6.4 billion and average short-term borrowings increased $4.5 billion. The yield on the total loan portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 4.91%, down five basis points compared to the earlier quarter, reflecting the impact of rate decreases, partially offset by the accretion from the merged loans. The yield on the average securities portfolio was 2.65 percent, up 12 basis points compared to the earlier period. 

The average cost of total deposits was 0.57 percent, up five basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.82 percent, up four basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average rate on short-term borrowings was 2.15 percent, down three basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average rate on long-term debt was 2.92 percent, down 27 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The lower rates on long-term debt also reflect the amortization of the fair value mark on the assumed debt. 

The provision for credit losses was $171 million, compared to $146 million for the earlier quarter. The increase in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to higher net-charge offs, partially offset by the residential mortgage loan sale in the current quarter. Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled $192 million compared to $143 million in the earlier quarter. 

Noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased $163 million compared to the earlier quarter. Excluding the net change in securities losses of $118 million and $22 million of losses recognized from the transfer of mortgage loans to held for sale, noninterest income increased $303 million. Approximately $217 million of the variance is due to the contribution from the merger. Insurance income increased $22 million due to higher production. The remaining increase is due to $42 million in income related to assets for certain post-employment benefits, which was offset by higher personnel expense. 

Truist Financial Corporation 73 

Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 was up $791 million compared to the earlier quarter. Merger-related and restructuring charges and other incremental operating expenses related to the merger increased $147 million and $101 million, respectively. Excluding these charges, noninterest expense was up $543 million. Approximately $400 million of the remaining variance was the result of noninterest expenses associated with the merged operations. 

Personnel expense increased $369 million compared to the earlier quarter. The increase was largely attributable to a $227 million impact from the merged operations, an $80 million increase in incremental operating expenses related to the merger, a $40 million increase for certain post-employment benefits that were offset by higher noninterest income, and a $29 million increase in production-based and other incentives. Amortization of intangibles increased $37 million, primarily due to the new intangibles created in the Merger. 

The provision for income taxes was $153 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $205 million for the earlier quarter. This produced an effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 of 17.4%, compared to 20.3% for the earlier quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the realization of income tax credits and a decrease in earnings during the current quarter. 

Reclassifications 

&#160; 

In connection with the Merger, captions in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Noninterest income and Noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income, loan categories and business activities within the segments were realigned. Amounts reported in prior periods' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. In certain other circumstances, reclassifications have been made to prior period information to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported shareholders' equity or net income. Refer to "Note 1. Basis of Presentation" for additional discussion regarding reclassifications. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

&#160; 

The accounting and reporting policies of Truist are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position and/or consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding Truist's accounting policies is fundamental to understanding the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, Truist's significant accounting policies and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in detail in "Note 1. Basis of Presentation." 

The following is a summary of Truist's critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments. These critical accounting policies are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a periodic basis. 

ACL 

Truist's policy is to maintain an ACL, which includes the ALLL and the RUFC, which represent management's best estimate of probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. Estimates for loan and lease losses are determined by analyzing historical loan and lease losses, historical loan and lease migration to charge-off experience, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, changes in internal risk ratings, expected cash flows on PCI loans, current assessment of impaired loans and leases, the results of regulatory examinations and changes in the size, composition and risk assessment of the loan and lease portfolio. As part of the ACL estimation process, Truist develops a series of loss estimate factors, which are modeled projections of the frequency and severity of losses. These loss estimate factors are based on historical loss experience, economic and political environmental considerations and any other data that management believes will provide evidence about the collectability of outstanding loan and lease amounts. The following table summarizes the loss estimate factors used to determine the ALLL: 

##TABLE_START Loss Estimate Factor Description Loss frequency Indicates the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan Loss severity Indicates the amount of estimated loss at the time of default ##TABLE_END

74 Truist Financial Corporation 

For collectively evaluated loans, the ALLL is determined by multiplying the loan exposure estimated at the time of default by the loss frequency and loss severity factors. For individually evaluated loans, the ALLL is determined through review of data specific to the borrower. For TDRs, default expectations and estimated prepayment speeds that are specific to each of the restructured loan populations are incorporated in the determination of the ALLL. Also included in management's estimates for loan and lease losses are considerations with respect to the impact of current economic events, the outcomes of which are uncertain. These events may include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in overall interest rates, political conditions, legislation that may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry and economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas and industries in which Truist conducts business. 

The methodology used to determine an estimate for the RUFC is inherently similar to that used to determine the collectively evaluated component of the ALLL, adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at default. A detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the ACL is included in "Note 1. Basis of Presentation." 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The vast majority of assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis are based on either quoted market prices or market prices for similar instruments. Refer to "Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures" for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments and "Note 2. Business Combinations" for additional disclosures regarding business combinations. 

Securities 

Truist generally utilizes a third-party pricing service in determining the fair value of its AFS investment securities, whereas trading securities are priced internally. Fair value measurements for investment securities are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads and broker quotes. Management performs procedures to evaluate the fair values provided by the third-party service provider. These procedures, which are performed independent of the responsible BU, include comparison of pricing information received from the third party pricing service to other third-party pricing sources, review of additional information provided by the third-party pricing service and other third-party sources for selected securities and back-testing to compare the price realized on security sales to the daily pricing information received from the third-party pricing service. The IPV Committee, which provides oversight to Truist's enterprise-wide IPV function, is responsible for the comparison of pricing information received from the third-party pricing service or internally to other third-party pricing sources, approving tolerance limits determined by IPV for price comparison exceptions, reviewing significant changes to pricing and valuation policies and reviewing and approving the pricing decisions made on any illiquid and hard-to-price securities. When market observable data is not available, which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity for certain securities, the valuation of the security is subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management. 

Certain securities are less actively traded and quoted market prices may not be readily available. The determination of fair value may require benchmarking to similar instruments or performing a discounted cash flow analysis using estimates of future cash flows and prepayment, interest and default rates. 

Truist periodically reviews AFS securities with an unrealized loss. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. The purpose of the review is to consider the length of time and the extent to which the market value of a security has been below its amortized cost. The primary factors Truist considers in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary are long-term expectations and recent experience regarding principal and interest payments and Truist's intent to sell and whether it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell those securities before the anticipated recovery of the amortized cost basis. 

MSRs 

Truist's primary class of MSRs for which it separately manages the economic risks relates to residential mortgages. Residential MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. While sales of MSRs do occur, the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available. Accordingly, Truist estimates the fair value of residential MSRs using a stochastic OAS valuation model to project residential MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios, which are then discounted at risk-adjusted rates. The OAS model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually-specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service and other economic factors. Truist reassesses and periodically adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions in the OAS model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market participant would consider in valuing the residential MSR asset. 

Truist Financial Corporation 75 

Fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to industry surveys, recent market activity, actual portfolio experience and, when available, observable market data. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, residential MSRs are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The value of residential MSRs is significantly affected by mortgage interest rates available in the marketplace, which influence mortgage loan prepayment speeds. In general, during periods of declining interest rates, the value of MSRs declines due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgage-refinance activity. Conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the value of residential MSRs generally increases due to reduced refinance activity. Truist typically hedges against market value changes in the residential MSRs. Refer to "Note 8. Loan Servicing" for quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in management's assumptions would have on the fair value of residential MSRs. 

LHFS 

Truist originates certain residential and commercial mortgage loans for sale to investors that are carried at fair value. The fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans. Changes in the fair value are recorded as components of residential mortgage income and commercial real estate related income, while the related origination costs are generally recognized in personnel expense when incurred. The changes in fair value are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the LHFS. Truist uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the economic effect of changes in fair value of the underlying loans. LHFS also includes certain loans, generally carried at LOCOM, where management has committed to a formal plan of sale and the loans are available for immediate sale. Adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value, up to the original carrying amount, and realized gains and losses upon ultimate sale are classified as noninterest income. The fair value of these loans is estimated using observable market prices when available, although may also incorporate other unobservable inputs such as indicative bids or broker price opinions. Refer to &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation" for further description of the Company&#8217;s accounting for LHFS. 

Trading Loans 

Truist elects to measure certain loans at fair value for financial reporting where fair value aligns with the underlying business purpose. Specifically, loans included within this classification include trading loans that are (i) purchased in connection with the Company&#8217;s TRS business, (ii) part of the loan sales and trading business within the C&#38;CB segment, or (iii) backed by the SBA. Refer to &#8220;Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies,&#8221; and &#8220;Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments,&#8221; for further discussion of the Company&#8217;s TRS business. The loans purchased in connection with the Company&#8217;s TRS and sales and trading businesses are primarily commercial and corporate leveraged loans valued based on quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active by a third-party pricing service. SBA loans are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government as to contractual principal and interest and there is sufficient observable trading activity upon which to base the estimate of fair value. 

Derivative Assets and Liabilities 

Truist uses derivatives to manage various financial risks and in a dealer capacity to facilitate client transactions. Truist mitigates credit risk by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans and other extensions of credit. In addition, certain counterparties are required to provide collateral to Truist when their unsecured loss positions exceed certain negotiated limits. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices and internal pricing models that use market observable data for interest rates, foreign exchange, equity and credit. The fair value of interest rate lock commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments, is based on quoted market prices adjusted for commitments that Truist does not expect to fund and includes the value attributable to the net servicing fee. Refer to &#8220;Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments&#8221; for further information on the Company&#8217;s derivatives. 

Purchased loans 

The fair value for purchased loans in a business combination is based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considers credit loss expectations, market interest rates and other market factors such as liquidity from the perspective of a market participant. Loans are grouped together according to similar characteristics and are treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques. The probability of default, loss given default and prepayment assumptions are key factors driving credit losses which are embedded into the estimated cash flows. These assumptions are informed by internal data on loan characteristics, historical loss experience, and current and forecasted economic conditions. The interest and liquidity component of the estimate is determined by discounting interest and principal cash flows through the expected life of each loan. The discount rates used for loans are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and include adjustments for liquidity. The discount rate does not include a factor for credit losses as that has been included as a reduction to the estimated cash flows. 

76 Truist Financial Corporation 

Intangible Assets 

The acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at their fair values. This often involves estimates based on third-party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, which are inherently subjective. The amortization of definite-lived intangible assets is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received, which is also subjective. Business combinations also typically result in goodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair values of the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates. Refer to "Note 1. Basis of Presentation" for a description of the impairment testing process. Management considers the sensitivity of the significant assumptions in its impairment analysis including consideration of changes in estimated future cash flows or the discount rate for each reporting unit. The discount rates used are based on current market rates. 

Income Taxes 

Truist is subject to income tax laws of the U.S., its states, and the municipalities in which it conducts business. In estimating the net amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future, the Company assesses the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other pertinent information. The income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the tax accruals and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws and new judicial guidance, the status of examinations by the tax authorities, and newly enacted statutory and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, impact tax expense and can materially affect operating results. Truist reviews tax positions quarterly and adjusts accrued taxes as new information becomes available. 

Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. Such assets arise due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from NOL and tax credit carryforwards. The Company regularly evaluates the realizability of DTAs, recognizing a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the DTA will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, the Company considers the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws, as well as estimates of future pre-tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented. Truist currently maintains a valuation allowance for certain state carryforwards and certain other state DTAs. For additional income tax information, refer to &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; and &#8220;Note 14. Income Taxes&#8221;. 

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations 

Truist offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to employees. Calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions, which are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used. The discount rate assumption used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to a high-quality (AA-rated or higher) corporate bond yield curve and the individual characteristics of the plans such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations. Management considered the sensitivity that changes in the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate would have on pension expense. For the Company&#8217;s qualified plans, a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would result in additional pension expense of approximately $50 million for 2020, while a decrease of 100 basis points in the expected return on plan assets would result in an increase of approximately $126 million in pension expense for 2020. Refer to "Note 15. Benefit Plans" for disclosures related to the benefit plans.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Evaluation of 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management of Truist is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Truist's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the Company's assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of Truist's management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material impact on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, commonly referred to as the "COSO" criteria. Based on this evaluation under the COSO criteria, which excluded the operations of SunTrust as noted below, management concluded that the internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019. 

In conducting the evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, the Company has excluded the operations of SunTrust Banks, Inc. and its subsidiaries (&#8220;SunTrust&#8221;) as permitted by the guidance issued by the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission (not to extend more than one year beyond the date of the acquisition or for more than one annual reporting period). In conducting the evaluation of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2019, the Company has excluded those disclosure controls and procedures of SunTrust that are subsumed by internal control over financial reporting. The Merger was completed on December 6, 2019. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, heritage SunTrust's assets represented approximately 40 percent of the Company&#8217;s consolidated assets and its revenues represented approximately five percent of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenues. See "Note 2. Business Combinations" for further discussion of the Merger and its impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, which excluded certain disclosure controls and procedures of SunTrust as noted above, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

The Company is working to integrate SunTrust into its overall internal control over financial reporting processes. Except for changes made in connection with this integration of SunTrust, there was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2019 that has materially affected, or is likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
