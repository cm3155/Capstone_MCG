 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Introduction 

This MD&#38;A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, other information contained in this document, as well as information contained in the December 31, 2019 Form 10-K. 

Government Response to COVID-19 

Congress, the FRB and the other U.S. state and federal financial regulatory agencies, as well as state legislatures and officials, have taken actions to mitigate disruptions to economic activity and financial stability resulting from COVID-19 and may continue to evolve such approaches and requirements in ways that further impact the business of the Company. The descriptions below summarize certain significant government actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions or government programs summarized. 

The CARES Act 

The CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and subsequently has been amended several times. Among other provisions the CARES Act includes funding for the Small Business Administration to expand lending, relief from certain U.S. GAAP requirements to allow COVID-19-related loan modifications to not be categorized as troubled debt restructurings and a range of incentives to encourage deferment, forbearance or modification of loans. One of the key CARES Act programs is the PPP, which temporarily expands the Small Business Administration&#8217;s business loan guarantee program through August 8, 2020. PPP loans are available to a broader range of entities than ordinary Small Business Administration loans, require deferral of principal and interest repayment, and the loan may be forgiven in an amount equal to payroll costs and certain other expenses during either an eight-week or 24-week covered period. 

The CARES Act contains additional protections for homeowners and renters of properties with federally backed mortgages, including a 60-day moratorium on the initiation of foreclosure proceedings beginning on March 18, 2020 and a 120-day moratorium on initiating eviction proceedings effective March 27, 2020. Borrowers of federally backed mortgages have the right under the CARES Act to request up to 360 days of forbearance on their mortgage payments if they experience financial hardship directly or indirectly due to the coronavirus-related public health emergency. FNMA, FHLMC, FHA and VA have extended their moratorium on foreclosures and evictions for single-family federally backed mortgages until at least December 31, 2020. 

Also pursuant to the CARES Act, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to provide loans, guarantees and other investments in support of eligible businesses, states and municipalities affected by the economic effects of COVID-19. Some of these funds have been used to support the several FRB programs and facilities described below or additional programs or facilities that are established by the FRB under its Section 13(3) authority and meeting certain criteria. 

FRB Actions 

The FRB has taken a range of actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. For example, on March 15, 2020, the FRB reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 0.25% and announced that it would increase its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities and begin purchasing agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. The FRB has also encouraged depository institutions to borrow from the discount window and has lowered the primary credit rate for such borrowing by 150 basis points while extending the term of such loans up to 90 days. Reserve requirements have been reduced to zero as of March 26, 2020. 

In addition, the FRB has established, or has taken steps to establish, a range of facilities and programs to support the U.S. economy and U.S. marketplace participants in response to economic disruptions associated with COVID-19. Through these facilities and programs, the FRB, relying on its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, has taken steps to directly or indirectly purchase assets from, or make loans to, U.S. companies, financial institutions, municipalities and other market participants. 

FRB facilities and programs established, or in the process of being established, include: 

&#8226; a PPP Liquidity Facility to provide financing related to PPP loans made by banks; 

&#8226; three Main Street Loan Facilities to purchase loan participations, under specified conditions, from banks lending to small and medium sized U.S. businesses; 

&#8226; a Primary Dealer Credit Facility to provide liquidity to primary dealers through a secured lending facility; 

&#8226; a Commercial Paper Funding Facility to purchase the commercial paper of certain U.S. issuers; 

46 Truist Financial Corporation 

&#8226; a Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility to purchase corporate bonds directly from, or make loans directly to, eligible participants; 

&#8226; a Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility to purchase corporate bonds trading in secondary markets, including from exchange-traded funds, that were issued by eligible participants; 

&#8226; a Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to make loans secured by asset-backed securities; 

&#8226; a Municipal Liquidity Facility to purchase bonds directly from U.S. state, city and county issuers; and 

&#8226; a Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility to purchase certain assets from, or make loans to, financial institutions providing financing to eligible money market mutual funds. 

Regulatory Considerations 

The regulatory framework applicable to banking organizations is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the stability of the financial system, rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors. Truist is subject to banking laws and regulations and various other laws and regulations, which affect the operations and management of Truist and its ability to make distributions to shareholders. Truist and its subsidiaries are also subject to supervision and examination by multiple regulators. Refer to Truist's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for additional disclosures with respect to significant laws and regulations affecting Truist. 

The descriptions below summarize updates since the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 to state and federal laws to, which Truist is subject. These descriptions do not summarize all possible or proposed changes in current laws or regulations and are not intended to be a substitute for the related statues or regulatory provisions. 

Stress Capital Buffer and CCAR 

The FRB has adopted a final rule that integrates its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with existing regulatory capital requirements. For risk-based capital requirements, the stress capital buffer replaces the capital conservation buffer, which was 2.5% through September 30, 2020. Under the final rule, beginning in the 2020 CCAR cycle, the FRB will notify Truist of its SCB requirements, which is equal to the greater of (i) the difference between its starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the supervisory stress test, plus the sum of the dollar amount of Truist&#8217;s planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon as a percentage of risk-weighted assets, or (ii) 2.5%. 

The final rule also makes related changes to the capital planning and stress testing process. Among other changes, the revised capital plan rule eliminates the assumption that Truist&#8217;s balance sheet assets would increase over the planning horizon. In addition, provided that Truist is otherwise in compliance with automatic restrictions on distributions under the FRB&#8217;s capital rules, Truist will no longer be required to seek prior approval to make capital distributions in excess of those included in its capital plan. 

The FRB assigned Truist a SCB of 2.7%, which is effective from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021. Consistent with the FRB&#8217;s mandate across the industry, Truist will update and resubmit its capital plan in early November 2020 to reflect changes in financial markets and the macroeconomic outlook, and the FRB will conduct additional analysis each quarter to determine if adjustments to this response are appropriate. 

The FRB also took several actions following its stress tests in light of the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, for the third and fourth quarter of 2020, the FRB is requiring certain large banking organizations, including Truist, to suspend share repurchases, cap common dividends per share to the amount paid in the second quarter, and further limit dividends according to a formula based on recent income. The FRB is also requiring banks to re-evaluate their longer-term capital plans. 

Revisions to Definition of Eligible Retained Income 

The U.S. banking agencies have adopted a final rule altering the definition of eligible retained income in their respective capital rules. Under the new rule, eligible retained income is the greater of a firm&#8217;s (i) net income for the four preceding calendar quarters, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income, and (ii) average net income over the preceding four quarters. This definition applies with respect to all of Truist&#8217;s capital requirements. 

Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology 

The U.S. banking agencies have adopted a final rule that permits banking organizations that implement CECL before the end of 2020 to elect to follow the three-year transition available under the prior rule or a new five-year transition to phase in the effects of CECL on regulatory capital. Under the five-year transition, the banking organization would defer for two years 100% of the day-one effect of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative increase in the allowance for credit losses since adoption of CECL. Following the first two years, the electing organization will phase out the aggregate capital effects over the next three years consistent with the transition in the original three-year transition rule. Truist has elected to use the five-year transition to phase in the impacts of CECL on regulatory capital.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FRB has adopted an interim final rule that temporarily changes the supplementary leverage ratio to exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation of a firm&#8217;s leverage exposure. The interim final rule applies to BHCs, became effective April 1, 2020 and will remain in effect through March 31, 2021. 

Loan modifications 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, banking regulators have encouraged financial institutions to support borrowers impacted by COVID-19. Refer to &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; for Truist&#8217;s policy related to COVID-19 loan modifications. 

CARES Act 

In addition to authorizing several programs to provide loans, guarantees and other investments in support of eligible organizations, states and municipalities affected by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act also includes several measures that temporarily adjust existing laws or regulations. These include providing the FDIC with additional authority to guarantee the deposits of solvent insured depository institutions held in noninterest-bearing business transaction accounts to a maximum amount specified by the FDIC, reinstating the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Authority to guarantee debt obligations of solvent insured depository institutions or depository institution holding companies, and temporarily allowing the Treasury to fully guarantee money market mutual funds. The CARES Act also provides financial institutions with the option to suspend certain GAAP requirements for coronavirus-related loan modifications that would otherwise constitute troubled debt restructurings and further requires the federal banking agencies to defer to financial institutions&#8217; determinations in making such suspensions. Refer to &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; for Truist&#8217;s policy related to COVID-19 loan modifications. 

Volcker Rule 

In June 2020, the five regulatory agencies charged with implementing the Volcker Rule finalized amendments to the Volcker Rule&#8217;s restrictions on ownership interests in and relationships with covered funds. Among other things, these amendments permit banking entities to have relationships with and offer additional financial services to additional types of funds and investment vehicles. These requirements are not expected to have a material impact on Truist's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

NSFR Rule 

The U.S. banking agencies have finalized a rule to implement the NSFR in the United States. The NSFR rule requires each of Truist and Truist Bank to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is a weighted measure of a company&#8217;s funding sources over a one-year time horizon, calculated by applying standardized weightings to the company&#8217;s equity and liabilities based on their expected stability, that is no less than the amount of required stable funding, which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets, derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics. As a Category III banking organization, Truist and Truist Bank are subject to an NSFR requirement equal to 85% of the full requirement. These requirements will become effective as of July 1, 2021.

Executive Overview 

Overview of Significant Events and Financial Results 

Recent Events 

Effective December 6, 2019, the Company completed the Merger. Reported results for Truist reflect heritage BB&#38;T prior to the completion of the Merger and results from both BB&#38;T and SunTrust from the Merger closing date forward. As such, comparative income statement data in 

this MD&#38;A for 2019 is only for heritage BB&#38;T. Significant Merger updates include: 

&#8226; In January 2020, Truist officially launched the Truist brand and visual identity, and Truist&#8217;s purpose: &#8220;Inspire and build better lives and communities,&#8221; along with its mission and values. 

&#8226; In March 2020, the purchase of the new Charlotte, NC headquarters building was completed and the building was renamed Truist Center. 

&#8226; Purchase accounting valuations for loans and intangibles were updated during 2020 resulting in a $193 million reduction in the fair value mark for loans, a $202 million increase in CDI and other intangibles and a $322 million reduction in goodwill. 

&#8226; In July 2020, Truist completed the previously announced divestiture of 30 branches with $425 million in loans and leases and $2.2 billion in deposits. 

&#8226; Completed the first major brand milestone in the client-facing conversion of Truist Securities. 

&#8226; Recently announced Truist Ventures, which is about building strategic partnerships and making investments in innovative companies and solutions. 

&#8226; Launched the &#8220;blended branch&#8221; pilot program, which is a key step towards closing branches that are very close to one another while continuing to take care of clients. 

&#8226; Truist remains committed to achieving $1.6 billion in net cost saves on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of 2022, excluding changes in net pension costs for 2021 and 2022. 

The Company is closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on clients, counterparties and the financial markets in which the Company conducts business. The Company expects the effects of this health crisis, which include disruptions or restrictions in clients&#8217; supply chains, closures of clients&#8217; facilities or decreases in demand for clients&#8217; products and services, to continue to adversely impact economic conditions. Also related to the health crisis, the U.S. has been operating under a presidential declared emergency since March 13, 2020, with various actions by the U.S. Congress and regulatory agencies. As a result of COVID-19, the Company experienced the decline of asset prices, reduction in interest rates, widening of credit spreads, borrower and counterparty credit deterioration and market volatility. Although the Company is unable to estimate the extent of the impact, the continuing pandemic and related global economic crisis is likely to adversely impact its future operating results. 

Truist acted swiftly to support our clients, teammates and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The following are some significant actions related to our crisis response. 

&#8226; Truist funded extensive line draws for commercial clients to help them fund liquidity and working capital needs during the onset of the pandemic. Additionally, Truist created an online, automated process for the PPP and began to accept applications during the first weekend of the program. Truist Served as the fourth largest PPP lender based on gross fundings. The carrying value of PPP loans was $12.2 billion as of September 30, 2020. 

&#8226; Provided accommodations to commercial and consumer clients. Of clients that have exited accommodation programs, 98.0% of commercial clients, and 94.5% of consumer and credit card clients, respectively, are current on or have paid-off their loans. 

&#8226; Pledged $50 million in philanthropic support through the Truist Cares initiative that is providing aid for basic needs, medical supplies and financial hardship across the nation, as well as grants to Truist&#8217;s community partners to support and expand technology initiatives and programs for youth, seniors, small businesses and people to rebuild, restore and create thriving communities. 

&#8226; Provided support for clients through payment relief assistance, including payments deferrals, waiving certain fees and offering additional accommodations. 

&#8226; Implemented multiple strategies to keep teammates and clients safe, including temporarily limiting branch lobby access and the extensive use of drive-thrus. Approximately 90% of branches are open and unlocked, or open with controlled access. Truist continues to follow appropriate COVID-19 safety protocols, including proper social distancing. Additionally, alternative work assignments for certain teammates currently working remotely have been extended until January 31, 2021. 

&#8226; Provided support for teammates including additional paid time off, flexibility and family care benefits. Provided teammates who have base pay below $100,000 annually a one-time pre-tax bonus of $1,200 in March to recognize their ongoing commitment to our clients and help alleviate some of the financial pressures caused by the pandemic. Enabled alternative work strategies that allowed more than half of our teammates to work remotely. Temporarily paid an additional onsite special pay rate of $6.25 per hour or $50 per day for teammates required to work in offices. 

Truist Financial Corporation 49 

&#8226; From mid-October to the end of 2020, Truist is providing teammates search tools for their in-home needs at no cost, including caregiver search tools, virtual academic support, child care priority and discounts, nanny placement services, elder care resources, and pet sitters and housekeepers. Additionally, eligible teammates will be eligible to receive a child care reimbursement of $50/day for a limited timeframe. 

See Part II, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; in this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding risks related to the effects of COVID-19. 

Truist is committed to addressing racial and social inequity and has taken a number of actions to expand efforts towards advancing equity, economic empowerment and education for clients, communities and teammates, including: 

&#8226; Truist&#8217;s various foundations provided a donation of $40 million to help establish CornerSquare Community Capital, formed to support community development financial institutions focused on providing funding to racially and ethnically diverse small business owners, women and individuals in low- and moderate-income communities, with a particular focus on African American-owned small businesses. The $40 million contribution to CornerSquare Community Capital consisted of two $20 million contributions made through the Truist Foundation, Inc. and the Truist Charitable Fund. These amounts did not impact Truist Financial Corporation's earnings. 

&#8226; Implemented a Truist Bank Community Benefits Plan under which the Company will lend or invest $60 billion to low- and moderate-income borrowers and in low- and moderate-income communities over a three-year period. 

&#8226; As part of the Corporate Social Responsibility report, Truist announced its commitment to increasing the number of racially and ethnically diverse employees among senior leadership positions from approximately 12% to at least 15% in three years. Truist also committed to ensuring regular, ongoing pay equity reviews for teammates. 

&#8226; Hosted more than 260 &#8220;Days of Understanding&#8221; sessions to date touching over 24,500 teammates, with more scheduled this year, that are designed to encourage bold dialogue on real-world topics in an open, trusting environment. 

&#8226; Scheduled virtual town hall meetings and discussion forums for teammates to share candid, personal experiences. 

&#8226; Began hosting unconscious bias training with Executive Leadership, Executive Leadership&#8217;s directs and other leaders. A total 22 sessions have been completed or scheduled with over 300 leaders being trained. 

&#8226; Hosted more than 100 Business Resource Group events to date this year to bring teammates together and discuss a broad range of cultural topics to create awareness and understanding of different communities. Many of these events are celebrations of inclusion months, but we also host executive panels on pertinent topics to lead with empathy, including the racial injustices that have occurred. 

&#8226; CEO Kelly King signed the pledge with CEO Action for Diversity &#38; Inclusion, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. 

&#8226; The entire Executive Leadership Team is part of the Truist Executive Inclusion and Diversity Council, which provides oversight and accountability. 

&#8226; To advance equity in a meaningful way, Truist launched a working group led by two members of our Executive Leadership Team and leaders of our African American Business Resource Group. Truist has also asked several community partners to help shape and guide its long-term actions. 

&#8226; Observed Juneteenth holiday. 

Executive Leadership Changes 

On June 30, 2020, Truist announced that Kimberly Moore-Wright, Chief Human Resources Officer, has been named to the Truist Executive Leadership team, effectively immediately. In December 2019, Moore-Wright was named Chief Human Resources Officer. Prior to that, Moore-Wright was the Director of Marketing and Digital Sales between January 2016 and November 2019 and the Director of Retail and Commercial Marketing Strategy between January 2012 and December 2015.

Financial Results 

Net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2020 totaled $1.1 billion, up 45.3%, compared with the third quarter last year. On a diluted per common share basis, earnings for the third quarter of 2020 were $0.79, a decrease of $0.16 compared to the third quarter of 2019. Truist's results of operations for the third quarter of 2020 produced an annualized return on average assets of 0.91% and an annualized return on average common shareholders' equity of 6.87% compared to prior year returns of 1.41% and 10.04%, respectively. Results for the third quarter of 2020 included merger-related and restructuring charges of $236 million ($181 million after-tax), incremental operating expenses related to the Merger of $152 million ($115 million after-tax), securities gains of $104 million ($80 million after-tax) and a charitable contribution of $50 million ($38 million after-tax). Results for the third quarter of 2019 included $34 million ($26 million after-tax) of merger-related and restructuring charges, and $52 million ($40 million after-tax) of incremental operating expenses related to the Merger and an after-tax reduction in net income available to common shareholders of $46 million from the redemption of preferred stock. 

Truist&#8217;s revenue for the third quarter of 2020 was $5.6 billion. On a TE basis, revenue was also $5.6 billion for the third quarter of 2020, an increase of $2.6 billion compared to the same period in 2019, reflecting an increase of $1.7 billion in TE net interest income and an increase of $907 million in noninterest income. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the Merger. 

NIM was 3.10% for the third quarter of 2020, down 27 basis points compared to the prior year. Average earning assets increased $232.0 billion, as average loans and leases increased $163.6 billion and average securities increased $30.9 billion. In addition, average other earning assets increased $34.0 billion primarily due to higher interest bearing balances at the Federal Reserve. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $155.0 billion and noninterest-bearing deposits increased $71.5 billion. The annualized TE yield on the total loan portfolio for the third quarter of 2020 was 4.04%, down 94 basis points compared to the prior year. The annualized TE yield on the average securities portfolio was 1.97%, down 63 basis points compared to the prior year. The average costs of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.35%, down 112 basis points compared to the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $421 million compared to $117 million for the third quarter of 2019. The increase in the provision for credit losses reflects a modest build to the allowance for credit losses primarily due to monitoring of clients&#8217; financial position and associated re-grading actions, as well as uncertainty related to performance after the expiration of relief packages and COVID-19, the impact of the Merger, and the effect of applying the CECL methodology in the current quarter compared to the incurred methodology in the prior year. Net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2020 totaled $326 million compared to $153 million in the prior year. Higher net charge-offs also contributed to the increase in the provision for credit losses and primarily reflect increases as a result of the Merger. The net charge-off rate for the current quarter of 0.42% of average loans and leases was up one basis point compared to the third quarter of 2019. 

Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2020 increased $907 million compared to the earlier quarter. The current quarter includes $104 million of securities gains. Excluding the securities gains, noninterest income increased $803 million, with nearly all categories of noninterest income being impacted by the Merger. In addition to these impacts, insurance income increased $31 million due to strong production and premium growth and residential mortgage banking income was up due to strong production and refinance activity driven by the lower rate environment, partially offset by lower valuations of mortgage servicing rights. Service charges on deposits partially rebounded during the third quarter due to increased overdraft incident rates and reduced refunds and waivers to accommodate clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2020 was up $1.9 billion compared to the earlier quarter. Merger-related and restructuring charges and other incremental operating expenses related to the Merger increased $202 million and $100 million, respectively. In addition, the current quarter was impacted by a $50 million charitable contribution to the Truist Charitable Fund. Excluding the items mentioned above and the impact of an increase of $141 million of amortization expense for intangibles, adjusted noninterest expense was up $1.4 billion primarily reflecting the impact of the Merger. In addition to the impacts of the Merger, operating costs were elevated due to COVID-19, which resulted in an additional $26 million of expenses compared to the third quarter of 2019. This was primarily related to net occupancy costs for enhanced cleaning. 

The provision for income taxes was $255 million for the third quarter of 2020, compared to $218 million for the earlier quarter. This produced an effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020 of 18.3%, compared to 20.8% for the earlier quarter. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to higher favorable permanent tax items and income tax credits earned in the current year. 

Truist's total assets at September 30, 2020 were $499.2 billion, an increase of $26.1 billion compared to December 31, 2019. The increase in total assets was primarily driven by an increase of $17.9 billion in interest-bearing deposits with banks reflecting higher balances held at the Federal Reserve, an increase of $11.4 billion in AFS securities and a $3.9 billion increase in total loans and leases. These increases were partially offset by a $4.3 billion increase in the ALLL and a $1.1 billion decrease in trading assets. 

Truist Financial Corporation 51 

Total deposits at September 30, 2020 were $370.7 billion, an increase of $36.0 billion compared to December 31, 2019. The growth in deposits reflects solid growth in all non-time deposit products due to a flight to quality and the government stimulus programs, partially offset by a decline in time deposits primarily due to maturities of wholesale negotiable certificates of deposit and higher-cost personal and business accounts. 

Asset quality ratios were relatively stable at September 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2020, nonperforming assets were 0.26% of total assets. The allowance for loan and lease loss coverage ratio was 5.22x nonperforming loans and leases held for investment, compared to 3.41x at December 31, 2019. The higher coverage ratio reflects the CECL adoption build, as well as a reserve build in 2020 in connection with COVID-19 and the economic downturn. 

Truist maintained strong capital and liquidity. As of September 30, 2020, the CET1 ratio was 10.0% and the average LCR was 117%. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, Truist issued $3.5 billion of preferred stock and redeemed $500 million of Series K preferred stock. The Company also issued $6.5 billion of senior and subordinated long-term debt. Truist declared common dividends of $0.450 per share during the third quarter of 2020. The dividend and total payout ratios for the third quarter of 2020 were 56.8%. In October 2020, Truist declared common dividends of $0.450 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020.

Analysis of Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income and NIM 

Third Quarter 2020 compared to Third Quarter 2019 

Net interest margin was 3.10%, down 27 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. Average earning assets increased $232.0 billion. The increase in average earning assets reflects a $163.6 billion increase in average total loans and leases and a $30.9 billion increase in average securities. Average other earning assets increased $34.0 billion primarily due to higher interest-earning balances at the Federal Reserve. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $155.0 billion compared to the earlier quarter. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $138.8 billion, average long-term debt increased $18.3 billion and average short-term borrowings decreased $2.1 billion. The significant increases in earning assets and liabilities are primarily due to the Merger, as well as impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting government stimulus programs. 

The yield on the total loan portfolio for the third quarter of 2020 was 4.04%, down 94 basis points compared to the earlier quarter, reflecting the impact of rate decreases and deferred interest for loans granted an accommodation in connection with COVID-19, partially offset by purchase accounting accretion from merged loans. The yield on the average securities portfolio was 1.97%, down 63 basis points compared to the earlier quarter primarily due to lower yields on new purchases and higher premium amortization. 

The average cost of total deposits was 0.10%, down 57 basis points compared to the earlier quarter, and the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.15%, down 84 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average rate on short-term borrowings was 0.85%, down 170 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average rate on long-term debt was 1.48%, down 194 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities reflect the lower rate environment. The lower rates on long-term debt also reflect the amortization of the fair value mark on the assumed debt and the issuance of new long-term debt. 

Nine Months of 2020 compared to Nine Months of 2019 

The net interest margin was 3.26% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, down 17 basis points compared to the earlier period. Average earning assets increased $231.3 billion, which primarily reflects a $165.8 billion increase in average total loans and leases, a $32.0 billion increase in average other earning assets, a $29.6 billion increase in average securities and a $3.8 billion increase in interest earning trading assets. The increase in average other earning assets primarily reflects higher interest-bearing balances at the Federal Reserve. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $169.3 billion. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $140.7 billion, average long-term debt increased $24.6 billion and average short-term borrowings increased $3.9 billion. The significant increases in earnings assets and liabilities are primarily due to the Merger, as well as impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting government stimulus programs. 

The yield on the total loan portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was 4.39%, down 64 basis points compared to the earlier period, reflecting the impact of rate decreases and deferred interest for loans granted an accommodation in connection with COVID-19, partially offset by purchase accounting accretion from merged loans. The yield on the average securities portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was 2.31%, down 30 basis points compared to the earlier period primarily due lower yields on new purchases and higher premium amortization. 

The average cost of total deposits was 0.27%, down 39 basis points compared to the earlier period. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.39%, down 60 basis points compared to the earlier period. The average rate on short-term borrowings was 1.46%, down 98 basis points compared to the earlier period. The average rate on long-term debt was 1.78%, down 157 basis points compared to the earlier period. The lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities reflect the lower rate environment. The lower rates on long-term debt also reflect the amortization of the fair value mark on the assumed debt and the issuance of new long-term debt. 

As of September 30, 2020, the remaining unamortized fair value marks on the loan and lease portfolio, deposits and long-term debt were $2.7 billion, $26 million and $238 million, respectively. The remaining unamortized fair value mark on loans and leases consists of $1.2 billion for commercial loans and leases and $1.5 billion for consumer loans and leases. These amounts will be recognized over the remaining contractual lives of the underlying instruments or as prepayments occur. 

The major components of net interest income and the related annualized yields as well as the variances between the periods caused by changes in interest rates versus changes in volumes are summarized below.

Provision for Credit Losses 

Third Quarter 2020 compared to Third Quarter 2019 

The provision for credit losses was $421 million, compared to $117 million for the earlier quarter. The increase in the provision for credit losses reflects a modest build to the allowance for credit losses primarily due to monitoring of clients&#8217; financial position and associated re-grading actions, as well as uncertainty related to performance after the expiration of relief packages and COVID-19, the impact of the Merger, and the effect of applying the CECL methodology in the current quarter compared to the incurred loss methodology in the earlier quarter. Net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2020 totaled $326 million compared to $153 million in the earlier quarter. Higher net charge-offs also contributed to the increase in the provision for credit losses and primarily reflect increases as a result of the Merger. The net charge-off rate for the current quarter of 0.42% was up one basis point compared to the third quarter of 2019. 

Nine Months of 2020 compared to Nine Months of 2019 

The provision for credit losses was $2.2 billion, compared to $444 million for the earlier period. The increase in the provision for credit losses 

for the first nine months of 2020 reflects the significant builds to the allowance for credit losses in the first and second quarters of the year due to increased economic stress associated with the pandemic and specific consideration of its impact on certain industries, as well as uncertainty related to performance after the expiration of relief packages and COVID-19, the impact of the Merger, and the effect of applying the CECL methodology in the current period compared to the incurred loss methodology in the earlier period. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were $914 million, compared to $442 million for the earlier period. Higher net charge-offs also contributed to the increase in the provision for credit losses and primarily reflect increases as a result of the Merger. The net charge-off rate of 0.39% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was down one basis point compared to the earlier period. 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income is a significant contributor to Truist's financial results. Management focuses on diversifying its sources of revenue to reduce Truist's reliance on traditional spread-based interest income, as certain fee-based activities are a relatively stable revenue source during periods of changing interest rates.

Third Quarter 2020 compared to Third Quarter 2019 

Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2020 increased $907 million compared to the earlier quarter. The current quarter includes $104 million of securities gains. Excluding the securities gains, noninterest income increased $803 million, with nearly all categories of noninterest income being impacted by the Merger. In addition to the impacts from the Merger, insurance income increased $31 million due to strong production and premium growth and residential mortgage banking income was up due to strong production and refinance activity driven by the lower rate environment, partially offset by lower valuations of the mortgage servicing rights. Service charges on deposits partially rebounded during the third quarter due to increased overdraft incident rates and reduced refunds and waivers to accommodate clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

56 Truist Financial Corporation 

Nine Months of 2020 compared to Nine Months of 2019 

Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 increased $2.7 billion compared to the earlier period. The current period includes $402 million of net securities gains primarily from the sale of non-agency mortgage-backed securities in the second quarter of 2020 and agency mortgage-backed securities in the third quarter of 2020. Excluding the net securities gains, noninterest income increased $2.3 billion, with nearly all categories of noninterest income being impacted by the Merger. In addition to the impacts from the Merger, insurance income increased $85 million due to strong production and premium growth and residential mortgage banking income was up due to strong production and refinance activity driven by the lower rate environment, partially offset by lower valuations of the mortgage servicing rights. Service charges on deposits were up despite reduced overdraft incident rates and refunds and waivers to support clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, investment banking and trading income was up, but was negatively impacted by credit valuation adjustments on the derivatives portfolio primarily related to the decline in interest rates and widening of credit spreads. Other income decreased $30 million primarily due to less income from private equity investments. 

Noninterest Expense 

The following table provides a breakdown of Truist's noninterest expense:

Third Quarter 2020 compared to Third Quarter 2019 

Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2020 was up $1.9 billion compared to the earlier quarter. Merger-related and restructuring charges and other incremental operating expenses related to the Merger increased $202 million and $100 million, respectively. In addition, the current quarter was impacted by a $50 million charitable contribution to the Truist Charitable Fund. Excluding the items mentioned above and the impact of an increase of $141 million of amortization expense for intangibles, adjusted noninterest expense was up $1.4 billion primarily reflecting the impact of the Merger. In addition to the impacts of the Merger, operating costs were elevated due to COVID-19, which resulted in an additional $26 million of expenses compared to the third quarter of 2019. This was primarily related to net occupancy costs for enhanced cleaning. 

Nine Months of 2020 compared to Nine Months of 2019 

&#160; 

Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was up $5.7 billion compared to the earlier period. Merger-related and restructuring charges and other incremental operating expenses related to the Merger increased $415 million and $292 million, respectively. In addition, the current period was impacted by $235 million of losses on the early extinguishment of long-term debt and a $50 million charitable contribution to the Truist Charitable Fund. Excluding the items mentioned above and the impact of an increase of $420 million of amortization expense for intangibles, noninterest expense was up $4.3 billion, primarily reflecting the impact of the Merger. In addition to the impacts of the Merger, operating costs were elevated due to COVID-19, which resulted in an additional $206 million of expenses compared to the earlier period. This was primarily related to additional on-site pay and bonuses for certain teammates, net occupancy costs for enhanced cleaning and teammate support expenses.

Analysis of Financial Condition 

Investment Activities 

The securities portfolio totaled $86.1 billion at September 30, 2020, compared to $74.7 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was due primarily to an $11.8 billion increase in Agency MBS, offset partially by a $368 million decrease in Non-agency MBS. The increase in the Agency MBS portfolio includes the redeployment of approximately $5 billion of excess reserves at the Federal Reserve. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company sold Non-agency MBS and during the third quarter of 2020, the Company sold and reinvested $3.2 billion in residential Agency MBS. These sales were the primary drivers for the gains of $402 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

As of September 30, 2020, approximately 3.0% of the securities portfolio was variable rate, compared to 3.6% as of December 31, 2019. The effective duration of the securities portfolio was 3.2 years at September 30, 2020, compared to 4.7 years at December 31, 2019. 

U.S. Treasury, GSE and Agency MBS represented 99.3% of the total securities portfolio as of September 30, 2020, compared to 98.7% as of the prior year end.

Total loans and leases held for investment were $306.6 billion at September 30, 2020, compared to $299.8 billion at December 31, 2019. In connection with the adoption of CECL, all loans previously in the PCI portfolio transitioned to PCD loans and were transferred to their respective portfolios. The growth in the commercial and industrial portfolio was primarily due to PPP loans. During the first quarter of 2020 many commercial clients drew down lines of credit, but the majority of those were repaid in the second and third quarter of 2020 as the government programs were implemented in response to the pandemic and clients better understood their liquidity needs.

Average loans and leases held for investment for the third quarter of 2020 were $310.4 billion, down $11.2 billion compared to the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to a decline in the commercial portfolio. 

The decline in the commercial portfolio was primarily in commercial and industrial loans and reflects the repayment of revolver usage. Within the commercial and industrial portfolio, Truist experienced growth in loans from mortgage warehouse lending due to the decline in rates and increased refinance activity, as well as growth in premium finance lending and equipment finance lending. Growth in these portfolios was partially offset by a decline in dealer floor plan lending. 

Average consumer loans decreased $1.3 billion primarily due to refinance activity resulting in a decline in residential mortgages and residential home equity and direct loans. This was partially offset by an increase in indirect other loans due to demand for loans for recreational and power sports equipment. 

COVID-19 Lending Activities 

The CARES Act includes provisions that were designed to encourage financial institutions to support borrowers impacted by COVID-19.

Overall asset quality ratios were relatively stable at September 30, 2020 compared to June 30, 2020. 

Nonperforming assets totaled $1.3 billion at September 30, 2020, up $62 million compared to June 30, 2020. Nonperforming loans and leases held for investment represented 0.37% of loans and leases held for investment, up 2 basis points compared to June 30, 2020. The increase in nonperforming loans held for investment is primarily in commercial and industrial loans, which was partially offset by a decline in commercial leases due to a charge-off on a PCD loan related to the implementation of CECL. Within the consumer portfolio, indirect automobile nonaccrual loans declined as some states lifted the moratorium on repossessions. Performing TDRs were up $110 million during the third quarter primarily in residential mortgage loans. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing totaled $1.2 billion at September 30, 2020, up $125 million compared to the prior quarter. The increase was primarily in government guaranteed student loans as forbearance programs in connection with the CARES Act have ended. In addition, residential mortgage loans 90 days or more past due increased primarily due to the repurchase of delinquent government guaranteed loans. The ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.39% at September 30, 2020, up five basis points from the prior quarter. Excluding government guaranteed loans, the ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.03% at September 30, 2020, down one basis point from June 30, 2020. 

Loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing totaled $2.1 billion at September 30, 2020, up $247 million compared to the prior quarter. Student loans 30-89 days past due increased $224 million, which almost entirely relates to government guaranteed loans as forbearance programs in connection with the CARES Act have ended. In addition, residential mortgage loans and indirect automobile loans increased, while commercial and industrial loans declined. The ratio of loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.70% at September 30, 2020, up 10 basis points from the prior quarter. 

Problem loans include NPLs and loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing as disclosed in Table 11. In addition, for the commercial portfolio segment, loans that are rated special mention or substandard performing are closely monitored by management as potential problem loans. Refer to "Note 5. Loans and ACL" for additional disclosures related to these potential problem loans.

TDRs occur when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties in the near term and a concession has been granted to the borrower. As a result, Truist works with borrowers to prevent further difficulties and to improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan. To facilitate this process, a concessionary modification that would not otherwise be considered may be granted, resulting in classification of the loan as a TDR. In accordance with the CARES Act, Truist implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. These loan modifications are generally not considered TDRs at the time of modification to the extent that the borrower was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and was less than 30 days past due at December 31, 2019, or in certain circumstances, at the time that the COVID-19 loan modification program was implemented, unless the loan was previously classified as a TDR. 

TDRs identified by SunTrust prior to the Merger date are not included in Truist's TDR disclosure because all such loans were recorded at fair value and a new accounting basis was established as of the Merger date. Subsequent modifications will be evaluated for potential treatment as TDRs in accordance with Truist's accounting policies.

The ACL totaled $6.2 billion at September 30, 2020, compared to $1.9 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily due to the adoption of CECL. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a $3.1 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses, including $2.8 billion that was charged to retained earnings before tax, and $378 million related to the gross up for PCD loans. The remaining increase in the allowance for credit losses primarily reflects deteriorated economic conditions. As of September 30, 2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 1.91% of loans and leases held for investment. The allowance for credit losses includes $5.9 billion for loans and leases and $366 million for the reserve for unfunded commitments. 

At September 30, 2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 5.22 times nonperforming loans and leases held for investment, compared to 5.24 times at June 30, 2020. At September 30, 2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 4.52 times annualized net charge-offs, compared to 4.49 times at June 30, 2020. 

68 Truist Financial Corporation 

Net charge-offs during the third quarter totaled $326 million, up $10 million compared to the prior quarter. As a percentage of average loans and leases, annualized net charge-offs were 0.42%, up three basis points compared to the prior quarter. Current quarter net charge-offs includes $97 million of charge-offs related to the implementation of CECL, which required a gross-up of loan carrying values in connection with the establishment of an allowance on PCD loans. Management performed a comprehensive review of PCD assets during the third quarter and concluded in certain situations that a charge-off was required. Excluding these additional charge-offs, net charge-offs would have been an annualized 0.29% of average loans and leases for the third quarter of 2020, down 10 basis points compared to the prior quarter. 

The following table presents an allocation of the ALLL. The entire amount of the allowance is available to absorb losses occurring in any category of loans and leases.

Truist monitors the performance of its home equity loans and lines secured by second liens similarly to other consumer loans and utilizes assumptions specific to these loans in determining the necessary ALLL. Truist also receives notification when the first lien holder, whether Truist or another financial institution, has initiated foreclosure proceedings against the borrower. When notified that the first lien is in the process of foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to determine if any additional charge-offs or reserves are warranted. These valuations are updated at least annually thereafter. 

Truist has limited ability to monitor the delinquency status of the first lien, unless the first lien is held or serviced by Truist. As a result, using migration assumptions that are based on historical experience and adjusted for current trends, Truist estimates the volume of second lien positions where the first lien is delinquent and adjusts the ALLL to reflect the increased risk of loss on these credits. Finally, Truist also provides additional reserves for second lien positions when the estimated combined current loan to value ratio for the credit exceeds 100%. As of September 30, 2020, Truist held or serviced the first lien on 30.8% of its second lien positions.

Deposits totaled $370.7 billion at September 30, 2020, an increase of $36.0 billion from December 31, 2019. The growth in deposits reflects solid growth in all non-time deposit products due to a flight to quality and the government stimulus programs. Time deposits decreased primarily due to maturities of wholesale negotiable certificates of deposit and higher-cost personal and business accounts. 

The following table presents average deposits for each of the last five quarters:

Average deposits for the third quarter of 2020 were $372.2 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion compared to the prior quarter. Average noninterest-bearing deposit growth was strong for the third quarter of 2020 due to a continuation of the flight to quality and the government stimulus programs. Average time deposits decreased primarily due to maturities of wholesale negotiable certificates of deposit and higher-cost personal and business accounts. 

70 Truist Financial Corporation 

Average noninterest-bearing deposits represented 33.3% of total deposits for the third quarter of 2020, compared to 30.7% for the prior quarter. The cost of average total deposits was 0.10% for the third quarter, down 12 basis points compared to the prior quarter. The cost of average interest-bearing deposits was 0.15% for the third quarter, down 17 basis points compared to the prior quarter. 

In September 2020, the FDIC published data from the Annual Summary of Deposits as of June 30, 2020. Truist is the 6th largest commercial bank in the United States based on deposits and maintained a first or second market position in thirteen of the company's Top 20 MSAs. 

Borrowings 

At September 30, 2020, short-term borrowings totaled $6.2 billion, a decrease of $12.0 billion compared to December 31, 2019, due primarily to a decrease of $10.8 billion in short-term FHLB advances. These borrowing sources were replaced with strong deposit growth. 

Average short-term borrowings were $6.2 billion, or 1.5% of total funding for the third quarter 2020, as compared to $8.3 billion, or 4.3% for the prior year quarter as these funding sources were largely replaced by the strong deposit growth. 

Long-term debt provides funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital, and primarily consists of senior and subordinated notes issued by Truist and Truist Bank. Long-term debt totaled $41.0 billion at September 30, 2020, a decrease of $331 million compared to December 31, 2019. During 2020, the Company issued $4.8 billion of senior notes with interest rates from 1.125% to 1.95% maturing in 2023 to 2030, $500 million in floating rate senior notes maturing in 2023 and $1.3 billion of subordinated notes with an interest rate of 2.25% maturing in 2030. These issuances were partially offset by the redemption of $3.7 billion of senior notes during 2020 and a decrease of $3.3 billion in long-term FHLB advances. The average cost of long-term debt was 1.78% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, down 157 basis points compared to the same period in 2019. FHLB advances represented 2.1% of total outstanding long-term debt at September 30, 2020, compared to 10.0% at December 31, 2019. Truist entered into $20 billion of FHLB advances during the first quarter of 2020 to build liquidity and ensure the Company was able to meet the funding needs of its clients. As market conditions stabilized and deposits increased, these advances were redeemed during the second quarter of 2020 and the Company recognized a loss of $235 million on the early extinguishment of debt. The redemption of these advances will improve net interest income, the net interest margin and the leverage ratios. 

In October 2020, Truist redeemed $300 million of floating rate senior bank notes due October 2021 and $600 million fixed-to-floating rate senior bank notes due October 2021. 

Shareholders' Equity 

Total shareholders' equity was $70.0 billion at September 30, 2020, an increase of $3.4 billion from December 31, 2019. This increase includes the issuance of $3.5 billion of preferred stock during the year, $3.2 billion in net income available to common shareholders and an increase of $1.3 billion in AOCI, which was partially offset by $2.1 billion related to the adoption of CECL and $2.0 billion for common and preferred dividends. In addition, Truist redeemed $500 million of its Series K preferred stock during 2020. Truist's book value per common share at September 30, 2020 was $45.86, compared to $45.66 at December 31, 2019. 

Refer to "Note 10. Shareholders' Equity" for additional disclosures related to preferred stock issuances. 

Risk Management 

Truist maintains a comprehensive risk management framework supported by people, processes and systems to identify, measure, monitor, manage and report significant risks arising from its exposures and business activities. Effective risk management involves appropriately managing risk to optimize risk and return, and operate in a safe and sound manner while ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Company&#8217;s risk management framework is designed to ensure that business strategies and objectives are executed in alignment with its risk appetite. 

Truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports transparency and escalation of risks across the organization. All teammates are responsible for upholding the Company&#8217;s purpose, mission, and values, and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the Company&#8217;s culture. The Truist code of ethics guides the Company&#8217;s decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance. 

Truist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations. Risk-taking activities are evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive risk-adjusted returns, while preserving asset value and capital. 

Compensation decisions take into account a teammate's adherence to, and successful implementation of, Truist's risk values and associated policies and procedures. The Company's compensation structure supports its core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risk-taking behavior. 

Truist Financial Corporation 71 

Truist employs a comprehensive change management program to manage the risks associated with integrating heritage BB&#38;T and heritage SunTrust. The Board and Executive Leadership oversee the change management program, which is designed to ensure key decisions are reviewed and that there is appropriate oversight of integration activities. 

Refer to Truist's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for additional disclosures under the section titled "Risk Management." 

Market risk management 

Market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios, securities, or other financial instruments. Market risk results from changes in the level, volatility or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices, including interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity, and commodity prices. 

Effective management of market risk is essential to achieving Truist's strategic financial objectives. Truist's most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet; however, market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk, price risk and volatility risk in Truist's BUs. Interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related options inherently embedded in bank products (options risk). 

The primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income, net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. At Truist, market risk management also includes the enterprise-wide IPV function. 

Interest rate market risk (other than trading) 

As a financial institution, Truist is exposed to interest rate risk both on its assets and on its liabilities. Since interest rate changes are out of the control of any private sector institution, Truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities, taking into account the volumes, maturities and mix, with the goal of keeping net interest margin as stable as possible. Truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk: (i) simulations of possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on gradual changes in interest rates; (ii) analysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and (iii) analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates. 

The Company&#8217;s simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends, using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans, as well as scheduled maturities and payments and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates. These assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to Truist&#8217;s assets and liabilities. The model also considers Truist's current and prospective liquidity position, current balance sheet volumes and projected growth and/or contractions, accessibility of funds for short-term needs and capital maintenance. 

Deposit betas are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process. Truist applies an average deposit beta (the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes) of approximately 50% to its non-maturity interest-bearing deposit accounts for determining its interest rate sensitivity. Non-maturity, interest-bearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts, savings accounts and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity. Truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables, including noninterest-bearing deposits, to determine the impact these variables could have on the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk position. The predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions, but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk.

The following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next 12 months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below. 

Table 21: Interest Sensitivity Simulation Analysis Interest Rate Scenario Annualized Hypothetical Percentage Change in Net Interest Income Linear Change in Prime Rate (bps) Prime Rate Sep 30, 2020 Sep 30, 2019 Sep 30, 2020 Sep 30, 2019 Up 100 4.25 % 6.00 % 3.43 % (0.56) % Up 50 3.75 5.50 2.68 (0.14) No Change 3.25 5.00 &#8212; &#8212; Down 25 (1) 3.00 4.75 (1.62) (0.22) Down 50 (1) 2.75 4.50 (1.94) (0.55) 

(1) The Down 25 and 50 rates are floored at one basis point and may not reflect Down 25 and 50 basis points for all rate indices. 

Rate sensitivity increased compared to the prior periods, primarily driven by loan and deposit mix changes related to the Merger and recent activity, increased fixed rate funding, and increased noninterest-bearing deposits. 

Management considers how the interest rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix. Liquidity in the banking industry has been very strong during the current economic cycle. Much of this liquidity increase has resulted in growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Consistent with the industry, Truist has seen a significant increase in this funding source. The behavior of these deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the interest rate risk position of Truist. A loss of these deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of Truist&#8217;s balance sheet as the Company would increase interest-bearing funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source. 

The following table shows the results of Truist's interest-rate sensitivity position assuming the loss of demand deposits and an associated increase in managed rate deposits under various scenarios. For purposes of this analysis, Truist modeled the incremental beta of managed rate deposits for the replacement of the demand deposits at 100%. 

Table 22: Deposit Mix Sensitivity Analysis Linear Change in Rates (bps) Base Scenario at September,30,2020 (1) Results Assuming a $10 Billion Decrease in Noninterest-Bearing Demand Deposits Up 100 3.43 % 3.02 % Up 50 2.68 2.38 

(1) The base scenario is equal to the annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at September 30, 2020 as presented in the preceding table. 

If rates increased 100 basis points, Truist could absorb the loss of $82.8 billion, or 66.6%, of noninterest-bearing deposit balances and replace them with managed rate deposits with a beta of 100% before becoming neutral to interest rate changes. 

Truist also uses an EVE analysis to focus on longer-term projected changes in asset and liability values given potential changes in interest rates. This measure allows Truist to analyze interest rate risk that falls outside the net interest income simulation period. The EVE model is a discounted cash flow of the portfolio of assets, liabilities and derivative instruments. The difference in the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities is defined as EVE. 

The following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on EVE: 

Table 23: EVE Simulation Analysis Change in Interest Rates (bps) Hypothetical Percentage Change in EVE Sep 30, 2020 Sep 30, 2019 Up 100 7.4 % 3.2 % No Change &#8212; &#8212; Down 100 (6.8) (13.2) 

Truist uses financial instruments including derivatives to manage interest rate risk related to securities, commercial loans, MSRs and mortgage banking operations, long-term debt and other funding sources. During October 2020, Truist initiated a new investment securities fair value hedging program, whereby pay fixed interest rate swaps are utilized. Truist also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients and as part of associated hedging activities. As of September 30, 2020, Truist had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling $303.6 billion, with an associated net fair value of $3.6 billion. See "Note 16. Derivative Financial Instruments" for additional disclosures. 

Truist Financial Corporation 73 

LIBOR in its current form may no longer be available after 2021. Truist has LIBOR-based contracts that extend beyond 2021. To prepare for the possible transition to an alternative reference rate, management has formed a cross-functional project team to address the LIBOR transition. The project team has performed an assessment to identify the potential risks related to the transition from LIBOR to a new index. The project team provides updates to management and the Board. 

The project team is reviewing contract fallback language for loans and leases and noted that certain contracts will need updated provisions for the transition, and the team is coordinating with impacted lines of business to update LIBOR fallback language generally consistent with the ARRC recommendation. Truist is continuing to evaluate the impact on these contracts and other financial instruments, systems implications, hedging strategies, and other related operational and market risks. Market risks associated with this change are dependent on the alternative reference rates available and market conditions at transition. For a further discussion of the various risks associated with the potential cessation of LIBOR and the transition to alternative reference rates, refer to the section titled "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. In October 2020, Truist began offering SOFR-based lending solutions to wholesale and retail clients. Truist expects SOFR to become a more commonly-used pricing benchmark across the industry. Truist continues to evaluate SOFR for additional product offerings and other alternative reference rates as replacements for LIBOR. 

Market risk from trading activities 

As a financial intermediary, Truist provides its clients access to derivatives, foreign exchange and securities markets, which generate market risks. Trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach, which includes measuring risk using VaR, stress testing and sensitivity analysis. Risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level to ensure exposures are in line with Truist's risk appetite. 

Truist is subject to risk-based capital guidelines for market risk under the Market Risk Rule. 

Covered trading positions 

Covered positions subject to the Market Risk Rule include trading assets and liabilities, specifically those held for the purpose of short-term resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements, or to lock in arbitrage profits. Truist&#8217;s trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for our clients, as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity. The trading portfolio, measured in terms of VaR, consists primarily of four sub-portfolios of covered positions: (i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income securities, (iii) interest rate derivatives and (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker across different asset classes, Truist&#8217;s trading portfolio also contains other sub-portfolios, including foreign exchange, loan trading, and commodity derivatives; however, these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures. 

Valuation policies, procedures, and methodologies exist for all covered positions. Additionally, trading positions are subject to independent price verification. See "Note 16. Derivative Financial Instruments,&#8221; "Note 15. Fair Value Disclosures,&#8221; and &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; herein for discussion of valuation policies, procedures and methodologies. 

Securitizations 

As of September 30, 2020, the aggregate market value of on-balance sheet securitization positions subject to the Market Risk Rule was $5 million, all of which were non-agency asset backed securities positions. Consistent with the Market Risk Rule requirements, the Company performs pre-purchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including, but not limited to, deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets, that materially affect valuation and performance. Securitization positions are subject to Truist&#8217;s comprehensive risk management framework, which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits. There were no off-balance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period. 

Correlation trading positions 

The trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of September 30, 2020.

VaR-based measures 

VaR measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon. Truist utilizes a historical VaR methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions. Prior to the integration of the two institutional broker dealer businesses to form Truist Securities in the third quarter of 2020, Truist operated two historical VaR models and the aggregate company-wide VaR across the systems was determined additively with no benefit of diversification. The heritage BB&#38;T VaR model was retired following the formation of Truist Securities. Following the formation of Truist Securities, VaR is calculated on a consolidated basis using the Truist VaR engine. For risk management purposes, the VaR calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a one-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the Company calculates VaR using a 10-day holding period and a 99% confidence level. Due to inherent limitations of the VaR methodology, such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance, VaR is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk. Other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing, profit and loss attribution, and stop loss limits. 

The trading portfolio&#8217;s VaR profile is influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and composition of the portfolio, market volatility and the correlation between different positions. A portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of risk from each of the individual sub-portfolios. As such, risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories thereby creating a portfolio diversification benefit. The following table summarizes certain VaR-based measures for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. The increase from the prior year was mainly due to the integration of the heritage SunTrust trading business and the market volatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As illustrated in the table below, the inclusion of volatility levels observed in March and April in the 12 month VaR historic look back window led to a convergence between VaR and Stressed VaR measures. 

Table 24: VaR-based Measures Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 (Dollars in millions) 10-Day Holding Period 1-Day Holding Period 10-Day Holding Period 1-Day Holding Period 10-Day Holding Period 1-Day Holding Period 10-Day Holding Period 1-Day Holding Period VaR-based Measures: Maximum $ 65 $ 11 $ 1 $ 1 $ 65 $ 11 $ 2 $ 1 Average 31 6 1 &#8212; 23 5 1 &#8212; Minimum 13 3 &#8212; &#8212; 3 1 &#8212; &#8212; Period-end 46 8 1 &#8212; 46 8 1 &#8212; VaR by Risk Class: Interest Rate Risk 1 &#8212; 1 &#8212; Credit Spread Risk 10 &#8212; 10 &#8212; Equity Price Risk 2 &#8212; 2 &#8212; Foreign Exchange Risk &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Portfolio Diversification (6) &#8212; (6) &#8212; Period-end 8 &#8212; 8 &#8212; 

Stressed VaR-based measures 

Stressed VaR, another component of market risk capital, is calculated using the same internal models as used for the VaR-based measure. Stressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level and employs a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelve-month historical window selected to reflect a period of significant financial stress for our trading portfolio. The following table summarizes Stressed VaR-based measures: 

Table 25: Stressed VaR-based Measures - 10 Day Holding Period Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Maximum $ 65 $ 4 $ 65 $ 6 Average 31 3 31 4 Minimum 14 2 13 2 Period-end 46 2 46 2 

The increase from the prior year in stressed VaR-based measures was due to the integration of heritage SunTrust trading business after the Merger and the market volatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Truist Financial Corporation 75 

Specific risk measures 

Specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements (e.g. default, event risks). The Market Risk Rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a model-based approach, subject to regulatory approval. Truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital. As such, incremental risk capital requirements do not apply. 

VaR model backtesting 

In accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the Company evaluates the accuracy of its VaR model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) from covered positions with the corresponding daily VaR-based measures generated by the model. 

There were eight company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic which led to a sudden and significant repricing of financial markets during the first and second quarter of 2020, amid an increase in market volatility and deterioration in overall market liquidity. In accordance with established policy and procedure, all company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of VaR model use and performance. Following such reviews, it was determined that the VaR model performed in line with expectations. However, the extreme moves in underlying market risk factors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic would not typically have been captured within the 1-day VaR measure. 

Model risk management 

MRM is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models. The validation activities are conducted in accordance with MRM policy, which incorporates regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness, ongoing monitoring and outcomes analysis. As part of ongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets, assess evolving modeling approaches, and to identify potential model enhancement. 

Stress testing 

76 Truist Financial Corporation 

The Company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily VaR and other risk limits reporting. The stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme, but plausible, stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses. Stress tests include simulations for historical repeats and hypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading positions within each applicable market risk category (interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange rate risk, credit spread risk, and commodity price risk) are included in the Company's comprehensive stress testing framework. Management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates, as necessary, to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately. Management also utilizes stress analyses to support the Company&#8217;s capital adequacy assessment standards. See the &#8220;Capital&#8221; section of this MD&#38;A for additional discussion of capital adequacy. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs, including deposit withdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other liabilities, and funding of loan commitments. In addition to the level of liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents and AFS securities, other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including access to a variety of funding sources, maintaining borrowing capacity, growing core deposits, loan repayment and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale. 

Truist monitors the ability to meet client demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions. In considering its liquidity position, management evaluates Truist's funding mix based on client core funding, client rate-sensitive funding and national markets funding. In addition, management evaluates exposure to rate-sensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less. Management also measures liquidity needs against 30 days of stressed cash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To ensure a strong liquidity position, and compliance with regulatory requirements, management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities. As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Truist's liquid asset buffer, as a percent of total assets, was 18.6% and 16.5%, respectively. 

The LCR rule directs large U.S. banking organizations to hold unencumbered high-quality liquid assets sufficient to withstand projected 30-day total net cash outflows, each as defined under the LCR rule. As of January 1, 2020, Truist is subject to the Category III reduced LCR requirements. Truist's average LCR was 117% for the three months ended September 30, 2020, well above the regulatory minimum. 

The ability to raise funding at competitive prices is affected by the rating agencies' views of the Parent Company's and Truist Bank's credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings. Management meets with the rating agencies on a regular basis to discuss current outlooks. In April 2020, DBRS revised its outlook for Truist and Truist Bank from &#8220;positive&#8221; to &#8220;stable,&#8221; citing economic deterioration related to COVID-19. DBRS affirmed all other ratings for Truist and Truist Bank. Additionally, Fitch revised its outlook for Truist and Truist Bank from &#8220;stable&#8221; to &#8220;negative,&#8221; also citing pandemic-related economic deterioration. Fitch downgraded Truist&#8217;s subordinated debt to A-, and upgraded Truist&#8217;s preferred stock to BBB, in order to align these ratings to its recently revised bank rating methodology. 

In July 2020, Fitch completed the implementation of its revised bank rating methodology. As a result, Fitch downgraded Truist&#8217;s senior unsecured debt to A and affirmed Truist Bank&#8217;s senior unsecured and subordinated debt ratings. This rating action taken by Fitch was solely a function of implementing its revised bank rating methodology and did not reflect a change in Fitch&#8217;s current or expected view of Truist&#8217;s or Truist Bank&#8217;s credit fundamentals. 

See "Liquidity" section of the MD&#38;A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for additional information regarding credit ratings. 

Parent Company 

The Parent Company serves as the primary source of capital for the operating subsidiaries. The Parent Company's assets consist primarily of cash on deposit with Truist Bank, equity investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and accounts receivable from subsidiaries. The principal obligations of the Parent Company are payments on long-term debt. The main sources of funds for the Parent Company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries, repayments of advances to subsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance of equity and long-term debt. The primary uses of funds by the Parent Company are investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders, retirement of common stock, and payments on long-term debt. 

See "Note 22. Parent Company Financial Information" of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions. 

Truist Financial Corporation 77 

Access to funding at the Parent Company is more sensitive to market disruptions. Therefore, Truist prudently manages cash levels at the Parent Company to cover a minimum of one year of projected cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments, debt service, common and preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities, without the benefit of any new cash inflows. Truist maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of cash outflows. In determining the buffer, Truist considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates, serving as a source of strength to Truist Bank, and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital markets. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Parent Company had 46 months and 29 months, respectively, of cash on hand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and 22 months and 20 months, respectively, when including the payment of common stock dividends. 

Truist Bank 

Truist carefully manages liquidity risk at Truist Bank. Truist Bank's primary source of funding is client deposits. Continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of Truist Bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested. 

Truist Bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements. These sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes, institutional CDs, overnight and term Federal funds markets, and retail brokered CDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to secured borrowing sources including FHLB advances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB discount window. At September 30, 2020, Truist Bank had approximately $169.5 billion of available secured borrowing capacity, which represents approximately 8.3 times the amount of one-year wholesale funding maturities. In addition to secured borrowing sources, Truist had excess eligible cash at the Federal Reserve Bank of $32.6 billion at September 30, 2020. 

Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Refer to Truist's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for discussion with respect to Truist's quantitative and qualitative disclosures about its fixed and determinable contractual obligations. Truist's commitments include investments in affordable housing projects throughout its market area, renewable energy credits, private equity funds, derivative contracts to manage various financial risks, as well as other commitments. Refer to "Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies,&#8221; &#8220;Note 15. Fair Value Disclosures&#8221; and &#8220;Note 16. Derivative Financial Instruments&#8221; in this Form 10-Q, and &#8220;Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies" of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these commitments. 

Capital 

The maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. Truist's principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support Truist's risk profile consistent with the Board-approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve optimal credit ratings for Truist and its subsidiaries and provide a competitive return to shareholders. Risk-based capital ratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets. 

Truist regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to periodically submit the Company's capital plans and stress testing results to the banking regulators. Management regularly monitors the capital position of Truist on both a consolidated and bank-level basis. In this regard, management's overriding policy is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of internal capital targets, which are above the regulatory "well capitalized" minimums. Management has implemented stressed capital ratio minimum targets to evaluate whether capital ratios calculated after the effect of alternative capital actions are likely to remain above minimums specified by the FRB for the annual CCAR process. Breaches of stressed minimum targets prompt a review of the planned capital actions included in Truist's capital plan.

(1) The Truist targets are subject to revision based on finalization of pending regulatory guidance and other strategic factors. 

(2) Truist's goal is to maintain capital levels above all regulatory minimums. 

(3) The current capital conservation buffer of 250 basis points was replaced by the SCB of 270 basis points effective October 1, 2020. 

78 Truist Financial Corporation 

During the first quarter of 2020, as market conditions evolved, Truist received Board approval to establish new interim operating targets that provide for sufficient capital levels while allowing the company to support clients through the economic downturn. These interim operating targets will be evaluated as economic conditions evolve. 

While nonrecurring events or management decisions may result in the Company temporarily falling below its operating minimum guidelines for one or more of these ratios, it is management's intent to return to these targeted operating minimums within a reasonable period of time through capital planning. Such temporary decreases below the operating minimums shown above are not considered an infringement of Truist's overall capital policy, provided a return above the minimums is forecasted to occur within a reasonable time period. 

In August 2020, the Federal Reserve informed Truist of its final SCB of 270 basis points for risk-based capital ratios. This buffer, which was determined based on stress testing results developed by the Federal Reserve, is 20 basis points above the Capital Conservation Buffer. The SCB will be effective from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021, at which point a revised SCB will be calculated and provided to Truist. Consistent with the Federal Reserve&#8217;s mandate across the industry, Truist will update and resubmit its capital plan in early November 2020 to reflect changes in financial markets and the macroeconomic outlook. Truist&#8217;s review of the results of the 2020 CCAR supervisory stress test notes that the modeled outcomes shown by the FRB differ from those calculated by the Company. Truist believes those differences are attributable to the application of purchase accounting associated with the Merger. Purchase accounting adjustments could result in a reduction in provision expense and an increase in pre-provision net revenue. These differences could result in higher capital ratios than were reflected in the CCAR results. 

Truist's capital ratios are presented in the following table: 

Table 27: Capital Ratios - Truist Financial Corporation (Dollars in millions, except per share data, shares in thousands) Sep 30, 2020 Dec 31, 2019 Risk-based: (preliminary) &#160; CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets 10.0 % 9.5 % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 12.2 10.8 Total capital to risk-weighted assets 14.6 12.6 Leverage ratio 9.6 14.7 Supplementary leverage ratio 8.9 NA Non-GAAP capital measure (1): &#160; &#160; Tangible common equity per common share $ 26.63 $ 25.93 Calculation of tangible common equity (1): &#160; &#160; Total shareholders' equity $ 69,973 $ 66,558 Less: &#160; &#160; Preferred stock 8,048 5,102 Noncontrolling interests 106 174 Goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred taxes 25,923 26,482 Tangible common equity $ 35,896 $ 34,800 Risk-weighted assets $ 377,045 $ 376,056 Common shares outstanding at end of period 1,348,118 1,342,166 

(1) Tangible common equity and related measures are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets, net of deferred taxes, and their related amortization. These measures are useful for evaluating the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or developed internally. Truist's management uses these measures to assess the quality of capital and returns relative to balance sheet risk. These capital measures are not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be presented by other companies. 

Capital ratios improved compared to year-end 2019, due to growth in CET1 capital, partially offset by higher risk-weighted assets. Truist's capital levels remain strong compared to the regulatory levels for well capitalized banks at September 30, 2020. Truist&#8217;s other capital measures also improved as Truist issued various capital instruments to strengthen its capital position. Truist issued $3.5 billion of preferred stock and redeemed $500 million of Series K preferred stock during the first nine months of 2020. In addition, Truist issued $1.3 billion of subordinated debt. Truist declared common dividends of $0.450 per share during the third quarter of 2020. The dividend and total payout ratios for the third quarter of 2020 were 56.8%.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and reporting policies of Truist are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Truist's financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position and/or consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. The more critical policies include accounting for the ACL, determining fair value of financial instruments, intangible assets, income taxes and costs and benefit obligations associated with pension and postretirement benefit plans. Understanding Truist's accounting policies is fundamental to understanding the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. The critical accounting policies are discussed in MD&#38;A in Truist's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additional disclosures regarding the effects of new accounting pronouncements are included in the &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; included herein. Except for the items noted below, there have been no changes to the significant accounting policies during 2020. 

Intangible Assets 

The severe economic disruption and related financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted Truist&#8217;s businesses. Truist&#8217;s commercial clients have experienced varying levels of disruptions to business activity, supply chains and demand for products and services. Additionally, many consumer clients have experienced interrupted income or unemployment. The pandemic also has resulted in continuing volatility to the global and U.S. financial markets, although intensive relief actions by the U.S. Congress and regulatory agencies intended to mitigate the extent of adverse economic effects have stabilized financial markets and liquidity, including with respect to equity prices and corporate credit spreads for Truist and the banking sector, in comparison to earlier in the year. 

As a result of these considerations, Truist performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill carried by the CB&#38;W, C&#38;CB and IH reporting units for impairment in the third quarter of 2020 to determine whether it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units was below its respective carrying amount as of period-end. In performing this assessment, Truist considered macroeconomic and market factors, industry and banking sector events, a sensitivity analysis on management&#8217;s forecast and assumptions, and Truist specific performance indicators, including any changes from when the Merger closed in December 2019. Despite the adverse economic and still uncertain environment caused by the pandemic, Truist&#8217;s third quarter 2020 results reflected profitable performance across each of its reporting units; strong capital and liquidity levels that have facilitated swift actions in support of clients, teammates and communities; and Truist&#8217;s affirmation that it remains committed to achieving its Merger value proposition, including targeted net cost saves. 

Based on the qualitative assessment performed, Truist concluded that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of September 30, 2020, and therefore no triggering event occurred that required a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If economic conditions deteriorate, or the pandemic&#8217;s effects prolong or worsen, it may be more-likely-than-not that the fair value of one or more of Truist&#8217;s reporting units falls below its respective carrying amount, which would require a quantitative goodwill impairment test.

ACL 

Truist's policy is to maintain an ACL, which represents management's best estimate of expected future credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. Estimates of expected future loan and lease losses are determined by using statistical models and management&#8217;s judgement. The models are designed to forecast probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic variables to historical experience. The models are generally applied at the portfolio level to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. The macroeconomic data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the reasonable and supportable period of two years. Beyond this forecast period the models gradually revert to long-term historical loss conditions over a one year period. Expected losses are estimated through contractual maturity, giving appropriate consideration to expected prepayments unless the borrower has a right to renew that is not cancellable or it is reasonably expected that the loan will be modified as a TDR. 

A qualitative allowance which incorporates management&#8217;s judgement is also included in the estimation of expected future loan and lease losses, including qualitative adjustments in circumstances where the model output is inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations with respect to expected credit losses. This allowance is used to adjust for limitations in modeled results related to the current economic conditions and capture risks in the portfolio such as considerations with respect to the impact of current economic events, the outcomes of which are uncertain. These events may include, but are not limited to, political conditions, legislation that may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry and economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas and industries in which Truist conducts business. 

Loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics and significant loans that are considered collateral-dependent are individually evaluated. For these loans, the ALLL is determined through review of data specific to the borrower and related collateral, if any. For TDRs, default expectations and estimated prepayment speeds that are specific to each of the restructured loan populations are incorporated in the determination of the ALLL. 

The methodology used to determine an estimate for the RUFC is similar to that used to determine the funded component of the ALLL and is measured over the period there is a contractual obligation to extend credit that is not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC is adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at default. A detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the ACL is included in "Note 1. Basis of Presentation."
