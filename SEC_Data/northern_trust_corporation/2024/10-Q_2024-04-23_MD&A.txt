Items 2. and 3. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The following is management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) of Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation) for the first quarter of 2024. The following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included in this report as well as the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Investors also should read the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.” Certain terms used in this report are defined in the Glossary included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. FIRST QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General The Corporation is a leading provider of wealth management, asset servicing, asset management and banking solutions to corporations, institutions, families and individuals. The Corporation focuses on managing and servicing client assets through its two client-focused reporting segments: Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. Except where the context requires otherwise, the terms “Northern Trust,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “its,” or similar terms mean the Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Overview of Financial Results Net Income per diluted common share was $0.96 in the current quarter and $1.51 in the first quarter of 2023. Net Income decreased $119.9 million to $214.7 million in the current quarter from $334.6 million in the prior-year quarter. Annualized return on average common equity was 7.3% in the current quarter and 12.4% in the prioryear quarter. The annualized return on average assets was 0.60% in the current quarter as compared to 0.92% in the prior-year quarter. Revenue decreased $97.8 million, or 6%, to $1.65 billion in the current quarter from $1.74 billion in the prior-year quarter. Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees increased $79.3 million, or 7%, from $1.06 billion in the prior-year quarter to $1.14 billion in the current quarter, primarily due to favorable markets and new business. Other Noninterest Income (Loss) decreased $174.0 million from $149.8 million in the prior-year quarter to a loss of $24.2 million in the current quarter, primarily due to the $189.4 million available for sale debt security loss reflected in Investment Security Gains (Losses) in the current quarter, partially offset by higher Other Operating Income. Net Interest Income decreased $3.1 million, or 1%, to $528.1 million in the current quarter as compared to $531.2 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher funding costs. In the current quarter, there was a negative Provision for Credit Losses of $8.5 million, as compared to a $15.0 million Provision for Credit Losses in the prior-year quarter. The negative provision in the current quarter resulted from decreases in both individual and collective reserves. For additional information, refer to the Provision for Credit Losses within “First Quarter Consolidated Results of Operations” section. Noninterest Expense increased $79.1 million, or 6%, from $1.29 billion in the prior-year quarter to $1.36 billion in the current quarter, primarily attributable to higher Compensation and Equipment and Software Expenses, as well as the $12.5 million FDIC special assessment recorded in the current quarter. The Provision for Income Taxes in the current quarter totaled $75.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of 26.1%. The Provision for Income Taxes in the prioryear quarter totaled $109.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.6%. FDIC Special Assessment In November 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a final rule to implement a special assessment to recoup losses to the deposit insurance fund associated with bank failures in the first half of 2023. In conjunction with the special assessment, $84.6 million was recognized as an accrued liability and related expense in the fourth quarter of 2023. During the current quarter, the FDIC published revised estimated losses as well as expected recoveries from the related bank failures. As a result, Northern Trust recognized an additional cost of $12.5 million in the current quarter, recorded to Other Operating Expense. Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees are based primarily on the market value of assets held in custody, managed or serviced; the volume of transactions; securities lending volume and spreads; and fees for other services rendered. Certain market value calculations on which fees are based are performed on a monthly or quarterly basis in arrears. Asset Servicing Custody and Fund Administration fees, the largest component of Asset Servicing fees, are driven primarily by values of client assets under custody/administration (AUC/A), transaction volumes and the number of accounts. The asset values used to calculate these fees vary depending on the individual fee arrangements negotiated with each client. Custody fees related to asset values are client-specific and are priced based on month-end market values, quarter-end market values, or the average of month-end market values for the quarter. The fund administration fees that are asset-value-related are priced using month-end, quarter-end, or average daily balances. Investment Management fees are based generally on market values of client AUM throughout the period. Typically, the asset values used to calculate fee revenue are based on a one-month or one-quarter lag. Securities Lending revenue is affected by market values; the demand for securities to be lent, which drives volumes; and the interest rate spread earned on the investment of cash deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities they have borrowed. The Other fee category in Asset Servicing includes such products as investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments, and other services. Revenue from these products is based generally on the volume of services provided or a fixed fee. Custody and Fund Administration fees increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to favorable markets and new business. Investment Management fees increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to favorable markets. Wealth Management Wealth Management fee income is calculated primarily based on market values and is impacted by both one-month and one-quarter lagged asset values. Fee income in the regions increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to favorable markets. Global Family Office fee income increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to favorable markets and asset inflows. Market Indices The following tables present selected market indices and the percentage changes year-over-year to provide context regarding equity and fixed income market impacts on the Corporation’s results. Foreign Exchange Trading Income increased compared to the prior-year quarter primarily driven by higher client volumes. Other Operating Income increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by higher income associated with a market value increase in supplemental compensation plans and lower expense associated with existing swap agreements related to Visa Inc. Class B common shares. Investment Security Gains (Losses), net reflects the $189.4 million available for sale debt security loss as compared to the $6.9 million gain on the sale of available for sale debt securities in the prior-year quarter, each arising from a repositioning of the portfolio. Net Interest Income Net Interest Income is defined as the total of Interest Income and amortized fees on earning assets, less Interest Expense on deposits and borrowed funds, adjusted for the impact of interest-related hedging activity. Earning assets—including Federal Funds Sold, Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell, Interest-Bearing Due From and Deposits with Banks, Federal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits, Securities, Loans, and Other Interest-Earning Assets—are financed by a large base of interest-bearing liabilities that include client deposits, short-term borrowings, Senior Notes and Long-Term Debt. Short-term borrowings include Federal Funds Purchased, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, and Other Borrowings. Earning assets are also funded by noninterest-bearing funds, which include demand deposits and stockholders’ equity. Net Interest Income is subject to variations in the level and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing funds and their relative sensitivity to interest rates. In addition, the levels of nonaccruing assets and client compensating deposit balances used to pay for services impact Net Interest Income. Net interest margin is the difference between what we earn on our assets and what we pay for deposits and other sources of funding. The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized Net Interest Income by average interest-earning assets. Net Interest Income stated on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis is a non-generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields. Management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income. A reconciliation of Net Interest Income on a GAAP basis to Net Interest Income on an FTE basis is provided in “Reconciliation to Fully Taxable Equivalent” within this MD&A. Net Interest Income, stated on a FTE basis, decreased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher funding costs. Average earning assets decreased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower borrowing activity. The net interest margin on an FTE basis decreased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher funding costs. Federal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits averaged $35.9 billion and decreased $0.7 billion, or 2%, from $36.6 billion in the prior-year quarter. Interest-Bearing Due from and Deposits with Banks averaged $4.4 billion and increased $0.2 billion, or 5%, from $4.2 billion in the prior-year quarter. Average Securities were $48.5 billion and decreased $1.9 billion, or 4%, from $50.4 billion in the prior-year quarter. Average taxable Securities were $43.3 billion in the current quarter and $47.4 billion in the prior-year quarter. Average nontaxable Securities, which represent securities that are primarily exempt from U.S. federal and state income taxes, were $5.2 billion in the current quarter and $3.0 billion in the prior-year quarter. Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell averaged $517.9 million and decreased $528.2 million, or 50%, from $1,046.1 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a shift to investments in higher interest earning assets. Loans averaged $41.6 billion and decreased $0.4 billion, or 1%, from $42.0 billion in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting lower levels of commercial and institutional, non-U.S, private client, and residential real estate loans, partially offset by higher levels of commercial real estate loans. Commercial and institutional loans averaged $10.6 billion and decreased $1.8 billion, or (1) (1) 9 FIRST QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Net Interest Income (continued) 15%, from $12.4 billion for the prior-year quarter. Non-U.S. loans averaged $2.8 billion and decreased $714.8 million, or 20%, from $3.6 billion for the prior-year quarter. Private client loans averaged $13.4 billion and decreased $492.3 million, or 4%, from $13.9 billion for the prior-year quarter. Residential real estate loans averaged $6.3 billion and decreased $155.0 million, or 2%, from $6.4 billion for the prior-year quarter. Commercial real estate loans averaged $5.2 billion and increased $288.2 million, or 6%, from $4.9 billion for the prior-year quarter. Average Other Interest-Earning Assets include collateral deposits with certain securities depositories and clearing houses, certain community development investments, Federal Home Loan Bank stock, Federal Reserve stock, and money market investments of $1,516.6 million, $878.8 million, $312.0 million, $70.0 million, and $64.7 million, respectively, which are recorded in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Northern Trust utilizes a diverse mix of funding sources. Average Interest-Bearing Deposits increased $3.7 billion, or 4%, to an average of $95.7 billion in the current quarter from $92.0 billion in the prior-year quarter. Interest expense for Interest-Bearing Deposits in the current quarter was driven by higher interest rates. Average Non-U.S. Offices Interest-Bearing Deposits comprised 67% and 68% of total average Interest-Bearing Deposits for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other average interest-bearing liabilities decreased $3.3 billion, or 17%, to an average of $16.8 billion in the current quarter from $20.1 billion in the prioryear quarter. The balances within short-term borrowing classifications vary based on funding requirements and strategies, interest rate levels, changes in the volume of lower-cost deposit sources, and the availability of collateral to secure these borrowings. Provision for Credit Losses In the current quarter, there was a negative Provision for Credit Losses of $8.5 million, as compared to a $15.0 million Provision for Credit Losses in the prior-year quarter. The negative provision in the current quarter resulted from decreases in both individual and collective reserves. The decrease in individual reserves was driven by one Commercial and Institutional (C&I) loan that was charged-off in the current quarter. The decrease in collective reserve was primarily in the C&I portfolio, driven by improvement in the quality of the portfolio, and in the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) portfolio, driven by improved macroeconomic factors. The reserve evaluated on a collective basis relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar risk characteristics. The Provision for Credit Losses in the prior-year quarter was primarily due to an increase in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis, driven by growth in the size and duration of the commercial real estate portfolio, primarily in multi-family properties, partially offset by improvement in credit quality for the commercial and institutional segment. Net charge-offs in the current quarter were $10.4 million, reflecting $0.7 million of recoveries and $11.1 million of charge-offs. The prior-year quarter included $2.9 million of net charge-offs, reflecting $1.1 million of recoveries and $4.0 million of charge-offs. For additional discussion of the allowance for credit losses, refer to the “Asset Quality” section in this MD&A. Noninterest Expense The components of Noninterest Expense are provided in the following table Compensation expense, the largest component of Noninterest Expense, increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher salary expenses and higher incentives. Outside Services expense increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher technical services and consulting fees, partially offset by lower subcustodian expense. Equipment and Software expense increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher software amortization, partially offset by lower equipment depreciation. 10 FIRST QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Noninterest Expense (continued) Occupancy expense decreased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a $9.8 million charge related to early lease exits recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Other Operating Expense increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the $12.5 million FDIC special assessment in the current quarter, partially offset by the impact of reclassifying certain investment amortization to the Provision for Income Taxes from Other Operating Expense in accordance with a new accounting standard. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $75.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of 26.1%, compared to $109.4 million in the prioryear quarter, representing an effective tax rate of 24.6%. The effective tax rate increased compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to a higher net tax impact from international operations and lower net tax benefits from tax-credit investments, including the impact of reclassifying certain investment amortization to the Provision for Income Taxes from Other Operating Expense in accordance with a new accounting standard. REPORTING SEGMENTS Northern Trust is organized around its two client-focused reporting segments: Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. Reporting segment financial information, presented on an internal management-reporting basis, is determined by accounting systems used to allocate revenue and expense to each segment, and incorporates processes for allocating assets, liabilities, equity and the applicable interest income and expense utilizing a funds transfer pricing (FTP) methodology. Under the methodology, assets and liabilities receive a funding charge or credit that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics on an instrument level. Additionally, segment information is presented on an FTE basis as management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest income. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income. Revenues, expenses and average assets are allocated to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management, with the exception of non-recurring activities such as certain corporate transactions and costs incurred associated with acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, restructuring, and tax adjustments not directly attributable to a specific reporting segment, which are reported within the Other segment. Effective January 2024, Northern Trust implemented certain enhancements to its FTP methodology, impacting the allocation of Net Interest Income to the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management segments. As a result, the approximate impact on the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management segments was a $31 million decrease and a $31 million increase in Net Interest Income, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Prior-period segment results have not been revised to reflect this methodology change. Reporting segment results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made. The results are also subject to refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies, which are typically reflected on a prospective basis. Asset Servicing Asset Servicing Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees For an explanation of Asset Servicing Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees, please see the “Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees” section within the Consolidated Results of Operations section of the MD&A. Asset Servicing Foreign Exchange Trading Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Foreign Exchange Trading Income increased $5.0 million, or 9%, from the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by higher client volumes. Asset Servicing Other Noninterest Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Other Noninterest Income increased $7.6 million, or 12%, from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher brokerage related revenue and higher income allocations. Asset Servicing Net Interest Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Net Interest Income stated on an FTE basis decreased $18.3 million, or 6%, from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the change in reporting segment allocation methodology beginning in 2024 noted above. Average earning assets decreased $5.6 billion, or 5%. Asset Servicing Provision for Credit Losses For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, there was a negative Provision for Credit Losses of $5.8 million compared to a $2.9 million negative Provision for Credit Losses in the prior-year quarter. The decrease of credit reserves in the current quarter resulted from decreases in both collective and individual reserves. The decrease in collective reserve was driven by improved macroeconomic factors and portfolio quality. The decrease in individual reserves was driven by one loan that was moved back to the collective reserve. Asset Servicing Noninterest Expense For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Noninterest Expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, increased $51.7 million, or 6%, from the prior-year quarter primarily due to higher expense allocations. 12 REPORTING SEGMENTS (continued) Wealth Management Wealth Management Net Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Net Income increased $37.0 million, or 21%, from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees and higher Net Interest Income, partially offset by higher Noninterest Expense. Wealth Management Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees For an explanation of Wealth Management Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees, please see the “Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees” section within the Consolidated Results of Operations section of the MD&A. Wealth Management Other Noninterest Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Other Noninterest Income increased $4.2 million, or 12%, from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher income allocations. Wealth Management Net Interest Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Net Interest Income stated on an FTE basis increased $9.3 million, or 4%, from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the change in reporting segment allocation methodology beginning in 2024 and higher average earning assets. Average earning assets increased $3.4 billion, or 10%, primarily due to higher client deposits. Wealth Management Provision for Credit Losses For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, there was a negative Provision for Credit Losses of $1.7 million compared to a $17.9 million Provision for Credit Losses in the prior-year quarter. The decrease of credit reserves in the current quarter resulted from decreases in both individual and collective reserves. The decrease in individual reserves was driven by one Commercial and Institutional (C&I) loan that was charged-off in the current quarter. The decrease in the collective reserve was primarily in the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) portfolio, driven by improved macroeconomic factors. Wealth Management Noninterest Expense For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Noninterest Expense, which includes the direct expenses of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, increased $22.5 million, or 5%, from the prior-year quarter primarily reflecting higher indirect expense allocations. Other Other—Noninterest Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Other Noninterest Income decreased $189.8 million from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the loss on sale of available for sale debt securities arising from a repositioning of the portfolio. Other—Noninterest Expense For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Other Noninterest Expense increased $4.9 million, or 32%, from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the $12.5 million FDIC special assessment, partially offset by lower non-allocated occupancy expense primarily arising from early lease exits. Select Earning Assets. Average securities decreased from the prior-year quarter, reflecting the impact of repositioning and reinvesting in short-term securities that will mature usually in one year or less. For additional discussion relating to the securities portfolio, refer to the “Asset Quality” section in this MD&A and to Note 4— Securities to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). Client Deposits. Average Interest-Bearing Deposits increased from the prior-year quarter primarily due to an increase in client balances as a result of strategic pricing actions. Demand and Other Noninterest-Bearing Deposits decreased from the prior-year quarter as clients migrated into higher yielding products. Short-Term Borrowings. Short-term borrowings includes Federal Funds Purchased, Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase, and Other Borrowings. The decrease in average Other Borrowings from the prior-year quarter was primarily due to strategic utilization of balance sheet capacity. Stockholders’ Equity. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Corporation declared cash dividends totaling $153.4 million to common stockholders, and cash dividends totaling $16.2 million to preferred stockholders, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Corporation declared cash dividends totaling $158.6 million to common stockholders, and cash dividends totaling $16.2 million to preferred stockholders. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Corporation repurchased 1,647,526 shares of common stock, at a total cost of $132.0 million ($80.11 average price per share), including 373,623 shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to share-based compensation. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Corporation repurchased 1,050,227 shares of common stock, at a total cost of $100.9 million ($96.04 average price per share), including 326,811 shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to share-based compensation. ASSET QUALITY Securities Portfolio Northern Trust maintains a high quality debt securities portfolio. Debt securities not explicitly rated were grouped where possible under the credit rating of the issuer of the security. The following tables provide the fair value of available for sale (AFS) debt securities and amortized cost of held to maturity (HTM) debt securities by credit rating. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the 3% and 2%, respectively, of HTM debt securities not rated by Moody’s, S&P Global or Fitch Ratings consisted of certificates of deposit with a remaining life of less than six months, as well as investments purchased by Northern Trust to fulfill its obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Northern Trust fulfills its obligations under the CRA by making qualified investments for purposes of supporting institutions and programs that benefit low-to-moderate income communities within Northern Trust’s market area. 16 ASSET QUALITY (continued) Securities Portfolio (continued) Net unrealized losses within the investment securities portfolio totaled $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Net unrealized losses as of March 31, 2024 were comprised of $35.3 million and $2.2 billion of gross unrealized gains and losses, respectively. Net unrealized losses as of December 31, 2023 were comprised of $20.1 million and $2.3 billion of gross unrealized gains and losses, respectively. $332.7 million of the $2.2 billion gross unrealized losses relate to AFS debt securities as of March 31, 2024, and $582.4 million of the $2.3 billion gross unrealized losses relate to AFS debt securities as of December 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024, the $25.6 billion AFS debt securities portfolio had unrealized losses, excluding securities with an allowance for credit losses, of $163.0 million, $55.6 million, and $31.0 million related to government-sponsored agency securities, sub-sovereign, supranational and non-U.S. agency bonds and other asset-backed, respectively, which are primarily attributable to higher intermediate rates. As of December 31, 2023, the $23.1 billion AFS debt securities portfolio had unrealized losses, excluding securities with an allowance for credit losses, of $200.3 million, $105.8 million, and $100.0 million related to government sponsored agency, supranational and non-U.S. agency bonds, and other asset-backed, respectively, which were primarily attributable to to lower yields and tighter spreads. In January 2024, the Corporation sold certain AFS debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position. The $189.4 million loss is recognized in Investment Security Gains (Losses), net on the consolidated statements of income for the period ended March 31, 2024. In November 2023, the Corporation sold certain AFS debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position. The $176.4 million loss is recognized in Investment Security Gains (Losses), net on the consolidated statements of income for the period ended December 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024, the $23.5 billion HTM debt securities portfolio had unrealized losses of $1.1 billion and $289.4 million related to government-sponsored agency securities and sub-sovereign, supranational and non-U.S. agency bonds, respectively, which are primarily attributable to higher intermediate rates. As of December 31, 2023, the $26.2 billion HTM debt securities portfolio had an unrealized loss of $1.0 billion and $294.9 million related to government-sponsored agency and subsovereign, supranational and non-U.S. agency bonds, respectively, which are primarily attributable to lower yields and tighter spreads. HTM debt securities consist of securities that management intends to, and Northern Trust has the ability to, hold until maturity. For additional information relating to the securities portfolio, refer to Note 4—Securities to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. To minimize potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. It is Northern Trust’s policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities purchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the counterparty until their repurchase. For additional information relating to the securities sold under agreements to repurchase, refer to Note 22—Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). Nonaccrual Loans and Other Real Estate Owned Nonaccrual assets consist of nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned (OREO). OREO is comprised of commercial and residential properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of loans. The following table provides the amounts of nonaccrual loans, by loan segment and class, and of OREO that were outstanding at the dates shown, as well as the balance of loans that were delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest. Loans that are delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest can fluctuate widely based on the timing of cash collections, renegotiation and renewals. Nonaccrual assets of $37.0 million as of March 31, 2024 decreased $28.1 million, or 43%, from December 31, 2023, primarily due to a private client loan payoff and a commercial and institutional loan charge-off. In addition to the negative impact on Net Interest Income and the risk of credit losses, nonaccrual assets also increase operating costs due to the expense associated with collection efforts. Changes in the level of nonaccrual assets may be indicative of changes in the credit quality of one or more loan classes. Changes in credit quality impact the allowance for credit losses through the resultant adjustment of the allowance evaluated on an individual basis and the quantitative and qualitative factors used in the determination of the allowance evaluated on a collective basis within the allowance for credit losses. Northern Trust’s credit policies do not allow for the origination of loan types generally considered to be high risk in nature, such as option adjustable rate mortgage loans, subprime loans, loans with initial “teaser” rates and loans with excessively high loan-to-value ratios. Residential real estate loans consist of first lien mortgages and equity credit lines, which generally require a loan-to-collateral value of no more than 65% to 80% at inception. Appraisals of supporting collateral for residential real estate loans are obtained at loan origination and upon refinancing or default or when otherwise considered warranted. Residential real estate collateral appraisals are performed and reviewed by independent third parties. The commercial real estate portfolio consists of commercial mortgages and construction, acquisition and development loans extended primarily to experienced investors well known to Northern Trust. Underwriting standards generally reflect conservative loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage requirements. Recourse to owners through guarantees also is commonly required. For additional information relating to the loans portfolio, refer to Note 5—Loans to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses—which represents management’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses related to various portfolios subject to credit risk, offbalance-sheet credit exposure, and specific borrower relationships—is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process. Northern Trust measures expected credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. A financial asset is measured individually if it does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets and the related allowance is determined through an individual evaluation. Management’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption. In determining an appropriate allowance level, management evaluates numerous variables, many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates, and takes into consideration past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The results of the credit reserve estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by Northern Trust’s Credit Loss Reserve Committee, which receives input from Financial Risk Management, Treasury, Corporate Finance, the Economic Research Department, and each of Northern Trust’s reporting business units. 18 ASSET QUALITY (continued) Allowance for Credit Losses (continued) As of March 31, 2024, the Allowance for Credit Losses related to loans, undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit, HTM debt securities, and other financial assets, was $162.4 million, $25.2 million, $12.4 million, and $1.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Allowance for Credit Losses related to loans, undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit, HTM debt securities, and other financial assets, was $178.7 million, $26.9 million, $12.7 million, and $0.9 million, respectively. There was a $0.5 million and $1.2 million allowance for credit losses related to AFS debt securities as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For additional information relating to the allowance for credit losses and the changes in the allowance for credit losses during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 due to charge-offs, recoveries and provisions for credit losses, refer to Note 6—Allowance for Credit Losses to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). The table provides the allowance evaluated on an individual and collective basis for the loan portfolio by segment and class. Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities of $1.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily attributable to higher net collateral deposited with derivative counterparties, net changes in other operating activities, pension plan contributions, partially offset by higher investment security losses. Net cash used in operating activities of $164.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, was primarily attributable to higher net collateral deposited with derivative counterparties and an increase in receivables, partially offset by period earnings, net changes in other operating activities, and the impact of lower non-cash charges such as amortization and depreciation. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $4.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily attributable to increased levels of Federal Reserve and other central bank deposits and net purchases of AFS debt securities partially offset by net proceeds of HTM debt securities. Net cash provided by investing activities of $4.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023, was primarily attributable to net proceeds associated with AFS and HTM debt securities, and decreased levels of Federal Reserve and other central bank deposits. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities of $6.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily attributable to the increased levels of total deposits, partially offset by decreased levels of federal funds purchased. Net cash used in financing activities of $4.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023, was primarily attributable to the decreased levels of total deposits, partially offset by increased levels of short-term other borrowings and federal funds purchased. The decrease in total deposits was primarily attributable to lower levels of savings, money market and other interest-bearing deposits. 20 CAPITAL RATIOS The capital ratios of Northern Trust Corporation and its principal subsidiary, The Northern Trust Company, remained strong at March 31, 2024, exceeding the requirements for classification as “well-capitalized” under applicable U.S. regulatory requirements. Northern Trust is a Category II institution as defined by the Federal Reserve Board which requires us to adhere to regulatory capital standards. In adhering to these standards, Northern Trust engages in a range of reporting and activities with regulators to affirm our financial strength and stability, including but not limited to, capital adequacy reporting that deducts any unrealized losses related to AFS securities from reported capital, and stringent, annual company-run and supervisory stress testing in the form of Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) exercises, which confirms our ability to remain solvent under severely adverse market conditions. The results of the 2023 Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST), published by the Federal Reserve Board on June 28, 2023, resulted in Northern Trust’s stress capital buffer and effective Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio minimum requirement remaining constant at 2.5% and 7.0%, respectively, for the annual capital plan cycle beginning on October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024. On July 27, 2023, the U.S. banking regulators issued the Basel III Endgame Proposal, which would change how risk-based capital requirements are determined for banking organizations including Northern Trust. The proposal would eliminate the existing advanced approach methodologies for determining risk-weighted assets (RWA) and replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach. The new requirements would be phased in over a three-year period beginning July 1, 2025. Based on our current understanding of the proposed rule, we estimate that, if the expanded risk-based approach had applied on a fully phased-in basis, and in the absence of taking any actions to mitigate its impact, our expanded risk-based approach RWAs would have been approximately 5% to 15% higher than our actual standardized approach RWAs. The table below provides capital ratios, as well as the required minimum capital ratios, for Northern Trust Corporation and The Northern Trust Company determined by Basel III phased-in requirements. In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (ASU 2023-07). ASU 2023-07 significantly expands disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments, primarily through more frequent and enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 does not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the impact of ASU 2023-07 will be limited to certain enhancements within the notes to the consolidated financial statements and therefore is not expected to have an impact on Northern Trust’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (ASU 2023-09). ASU 2023-09 enhances disclosures by further disaggregating existing annual income tax disclosures related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023- 09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, although early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the impact of ASU 2023-09 will be limited to certain enhancements within the notes to the consolidated financial statements and therefore is not expected to have an impact on Northern Trust’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income. In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-01, “Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Applications of Profits Interests and Similar Awards” (ASU 2024-01). ASU 2024-01 adds an example to Topic 718 which illustrates how to apply the scope guidance to determine whether profits interests and similar awards should be accounted for as share-based payment arrangements under Topic 718 or under other U.S. GAAP. ASU 2024-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, although early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, ASU 2024-01 is not expected to have an impact on Northern Trust’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income. RISK MANAGEMENT Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to raise sufficient funds or maintain collateral to meet balance sheet and contingent liability cash flow obligations when due, because of firm-specific or market-wide stress events. Northern Trust is a Category II institution as defined by the Federal Reserve Board which requires us to adhere to the same regulatory liquidity standards as U.S. global systemically important bank holding companies (GSIBs). In adhering to these standards, Northern Trust engages in a range of reporting and activities with regulators to affirm our financial strength and stability, including but not limited to, daily Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio calculations to regulators. We maintain a highly liquid balance sheet consisting principally of cash held at the Federal Reserve and other central banks, money market assets, and short-term investment securities, which were 61% and 59% of total assets as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 86% and 82% of Northern Trust’s securities portfolio is composed of U.S. Treasury, government sponsored agency and triple-A rated securities as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Market Risk There are two types of market risk, interest rate risk associated with the banking book and trading risk. Interest rate risk associated with the banking book is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in Net Interest Income and the market value of equity, including Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) from the AFS debt securities portfolio. Trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions. Northern Trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk: Net Interest Income (NII) sensitivity and Market Value of Equity (MVE) sensitivity. NII sensitivity provides management with a short-term view of the impact of interest rate changes on NII. MVE sensitivity provides management with a long-term view of interest rate changes on MVE based on the period-end balance sheet. Higher interest rates may impact the fair value of AFS debt securities which in turn affects Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), which can impact regulatory capital ratios. As part of its risk management activities, Northern Trust also measures daily the risk of loss associated with all non-U.S. currency positions using a Value-at-Risk (VaR) model and applying the historical simulation methodology. The following information about Northern Trust’s management of market risk should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 22 RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) Market Risk (continued) NII Sensitivity — The modeling of NII sensitivity incorporates on-balance-sheet positions, as well as derivative financial instruments (principally interest rate swaps) that are used to manage interest rate risk. Northern Trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity (i.e., change) of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates. Stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk). The NII sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. The simulation cannot precisely estimate NII sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. The following key assumptions are incorporated into the simulation: ▪ the balance sheet size and mix remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing, with the exception of certain nonmaturity deposits that are considered short-term in nature and therefore receive a more conservative interest-bearing treatment; ▪ prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a third-party mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions; ▪ cash flows for structured securities are estimated using a third-party vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the third-party mortgage analytics vendor; ▪ nonmaturity deposit pricing is projected based on Northern Trust’s actual historical patterns and management judgment, depending upon the availability of historical data and current pricing strategies/or judgment; and ▪ new business rates are based on current spreads to market indices. The following table shows the estimated NII impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point ramps upward and downward in interest rates relative to forward rates as of March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023. Each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a one-year period.
