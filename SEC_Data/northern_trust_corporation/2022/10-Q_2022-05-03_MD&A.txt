Items 2. and 3. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The following is management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) of Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation) for the first quarter of 2022. The following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included in this report as well as the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Investors also should read the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.” Certain terms used in this report are defined in the Glossary included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. FIRST QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General The Corporation is a leading provider of wealth management, asset servicing, asset management and banking solutions to corporations, institutions, families and individuals. The Corporation focuses on managing and servicing client assets through its two client-focused reporting segments: Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. During the first quarter of 2022, the Corporation changed the name of its Corporate & Institutional Services (C&IS) segment to “Asset Servicing.” Accordingly, the disclosures herein and all future disclosures regarding the Corporation’s reporting segments filed with, or furnished to, the SEC will refer to this segment as Asset Servicing. Asset management and related services are provided to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. Except where the context requires otherwise, the terms “Northern Trust,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “its,” or similar terms mean the Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. COVID-19 Pandemic and Recent Events Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Northern Trust has remained focused on the health and well-being of our workforce, meeting our clients’ needs and supporting our communities. With the overall improvement in COVID-19 virus trends, and guided by public health and safety recommendations and government regulations, we have begun to safely return to our offices in most locations, across all of our regions—consistent with our established protocols. We continue to provide our workforce with resources to facilitate this return to the office. We remain committed to closely monitoring the situation in all our locations and responding appropriately. During the pandemic, Northern Trust offered credit assistance to impacted clients under a government lending program and provided payment deferrals. The number of loans under the government lending program, as well as the number of pandemic-related payment deferrals, have declined since the start of the pandemic. For further information, please refer to Note 6 — Loans and Leases to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). Overview of Financial Results Net Income per diluted common share increased in the current quarter to $1.77 from $1.70 in the first quarter of 2021. Net Income increased $14.2 million, or 4%, to $389.3 million in the current quarter from $375.1 million in the prior-year quarter. Annualized return on average common equity was 14.2% in the current quarter and 13.7% in the prior-year quarter. The annualized return on average assets was 0.97% in the current quarter as compared to 0.99% in the prior-year quarter. Revenue increased $135.3 million, or 9%, to $1.72 billion in the current quarter from $1.58 billion in the prior-year quarter. Beginning in 2022, Trust, Investment and Other Servicing fees were impacted by the change in classification of certain fees that were previously recorded in Other Operating Income or as a reduction of Other Operating Expense. This change resulted in no impact to Net Income. The accounting reclassification increased Trust, Investment and Other Servicing fees in the current quarter by $18.5 million, with a $6.9 million decrease in Other Operating Income and a $11.6 million increase in Other Operating Expense. The classification changes are considered by the Corporation’s management to be a better representation of the underlying nature of the business as they are directly tied to client asset levels and the related services are more akin to our core service offerings. Priorperiod amounts have not been reclassified. Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees increased $104.7 million, or 10%, from $1.06 billion in the prior-year quarter to $1.17 billion in the current quarter, primarily due to favorable markets, new business and the accounting reclassification previously discussed. Other Noninterest Income decreased $10.3 million, or 6%, from $179.6 million in the prior-year quarter to $169.3 million in the current quarter, primarily reflecting lower Other Operating Income, partially offset by higher Foreign Exchange Trading Income. 3 FIRST QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview of Financial Results (continued) Net Interest Income increased $40.9 million, or 12%, to $381.0 million in the current quarter as compared to $340.1 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher average earning assets and a higher net interest margin. There was a $2.0 million provision in the current quarter, as compared to a $30.0 million release of credit reserves in the prior-year quarter. The current quarter provision was primarily due to an increase in the reserve evaluated on an individual basis for two commercial borrowers, partially offset by a slight decrease in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis. The reserve evaluated on a collective basis relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar risk characteristics. The decrease in the collective basis reserve was primarily due to continued improvements in credit quality mainly within the commercial real estate portfolio, partially offset by increases in the reserve driven by projected economic conditions. Noninterest Expense increased $88.4 million, or 8%, from $1.12 billion in the prior-year quarter to $1.21 billion in the current quarter, primarily attributable to higher Compensation, Outside Services, Equipment and Software expense, and Other Operating Expense. The Provision for Income Taxes in the current quarter totaled $121.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23.8%. The Provision for Income Taxes in the prior-year quarter totaled $120.8 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.4%. The effective tax rate decreased compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to a lower net tax impact from international operations. Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees are based primarily on the market value of assets held in custody, managed or serviced; the volume of transactions; securities lending volume and spreads; and fees for other services rendered. Certain market value calculations on which fees are based are performed on a monthly or quarterly basis in arrears. Low-interest-rate environments have historically had a negative impact on fees earned on certain products. Certain fees associated with money market mutual funds were waived by the Corporation due to the low-interest-rate environment. Northern Trust voluntarily waived $50.7 million and $50.2 million of money market mutual fund fees for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These fee waivers are impacted by the level of yields earned and account balances in certain funds, as the yields in these funds remained insufficient to pay the stated fees associated with such funds. Fee waivers are expected to decline to the extent the increase in short-term interest rates experienced during the first quarter of 2022 continues. Beginning in 2022, Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees were impacted by the change in classification of certain fees that were previously recorded in Other Operating Income or as a reduction of Other Operating Expense. The impact to Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees in the current quarter was $18.5 million, with $6.9 million relating to amounts previously recorded in Other Operating Income and $11.6 million relating to amounts previously reported as a reduction of Other Operating Expense. Prior-period amounts have not been reclassified. The components of Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees are provided below. Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees (continued) Asset Servicing Custody and Fund Administration fees, the largest component of Asset Servicing fees, are driven primarily by values of client assets under custody/administration (AUC/A), transaction volumes and the number of accounts. The asset values used to calculate these fees vary depending on the individual fee arrangements negotiated with each client. Custody fees related to asset values are client-specific and are priced based on month-end market values, quarter-end market values, or the average of month-end market values for the quarter. The fund administration fees that are asset-value-related are priced using month-end, quarter-end, or average daily balances. Investment Management fees are based generally on market values of client assets under management throughout the period. Typically, the asset values used to calculate fee revenue are based on a one-month or one-quarter lag. Securities Lending revenue is affected by market values; the demand for securities to be lent, which drives volumes; and the interest rate spread earned on the investment of cash deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities they have borrowed. The Other fee category in Asset Servicing includes such products as investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments, and other services. Revenue from these products is based generally on the volume of services provided or a fixed fee. Custody and Fund Administration fees increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to favorable markets and new business, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation and lower transaction volumes. Investment Management fees increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to new business, the accounting reclassification previously discussed, and favorable markets. Other fees increased from the prior-year quarter primarily due to the accounting reclassification previously discussed. Wealth Management Wealth Management fee income is calculated primarily based on market values and is impacted by both one-month and one-quarter lagged asset values. Fee income in the regions (Central, East and West) increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to favorable markets, new business and the accounting reclassification previously discussed. Global Family Office fee income increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to new business, favorable markets, and the accounting reclassification previously discussed. Market Indices The following tables present selected market indices and the percentage changes year over year to provide context regarding equity and fixed income market impacts on the Corporation’s results. Beginning in 2022, Other Operating Income was impacted by the change in classification of certain fees to Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees. The impact to Other Operating Income in the current quarter was $6.9 million relating to amounts now recorded in Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees. Prior-period amounts have not been reclassified. Foreign Exchange Trading Income increased compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to higher client volumes and market volatility. Other Operating Income decreased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by the accounting reclassification previously discussed and lower miscellaneous income. The lower miscellaneous income was primarily associated with a market 7 FIRST QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Noninterest Income (continued) value decrease in the supplemental compensation plans, which also resulted in a related decrease in supplemental compensation plan expense reported in Other Operating Expense. Please refer to Note 16 — Other Operating Income to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for further detail. Net Interest Income Net Interest Income is defined as the total of Interest Income and amortized fees on earning assets, less Interest Expense on deposits and borrowed funds, adjusted for the impact of interest-related hedging activity. Earning assets—including Federal Funds Sold, Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell, Interest-Bearing Due From Banks, Federal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits and Other, Securities, and Loans and Leases—are financed by a large base of interest-bearing funds that include client deposits, short-term borrowings, Senior Notes and Long-Term Debt. Short-term borrowings include Federal Funds Purchased, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, and Other Borrowings. Earning assets are also funded by noninterest-related funds, which include demand deposits and stockholders’ equity. Net Interest Income is subject to variations in the level and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing funds and their relative sensitivity to interest rates. In addition, the levels of nonaccruing assets and client compensating deposit balances used to pay for services impact Net Interest Income. Net interest margin is the difference between what we earn on our assets and what we pay for deposits and other sources of funding. The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized Net Interest Income by average interest-earning assets. Net Interest Income stated on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis is a non-generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields. Management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income. A reconciliation of Net Interest Income on a GAAP basis to Net Interest Income on an FTE basis is provided in “Reconciliation to Fully Taxable Equivalent” within this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section. Net Interest Income, stated on a FTE basis, increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher average earning assets and a higher net interest margin. Average earning assets increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher levels of net short-term interest-bearing deposits with central banks and banks, as well as loans, partially offset by lower levels of securities. The net interest margin on an FTE basis increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by a favorable balance sheet volume and mix shift. Net interest margin is expected to benefit in the future from the recent and anticipated increases in short-term interest rates. Federal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits and Other averaged $45.2 billion and increased $8.1 billion, or 22%, from $37.1 billion in the prior-year quarter, resulting from increased deposit inflows. The higher level of client deposits were primarily placed with the Federal Reserve and other central banks and in loans. Average Securities were $59.9 billion and decreased $1.3 billion, or 2%, from $61.2 billion, in the prior-year quarter and include certain community development investments, Federal Home Loan Bank stock, and Federal Reserve stock of $962.8 million, $70.1 million and $70.0 million, respectively, which are recorded in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Average taxable Securities were $57.4 billion in the current quarter and $57.5 billion in the prior-year quarter. Average nontaxable Securities, which represent securities that are primarily exempt from U.S. federal and state income taxes, were $2.5 billion in the current quarter and (1) (1) 10 FIRST QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Net Interest Income (continued) $3.7 billion in the prior-year quarter. Interest-Bearing Due from and Deposits with Banks averaged $4.4 billion in the current quarter and $6.5 billion in the prior-year quarter. Loans and Leases averaged $39.5 billion and increased $5.3 billion, or 16%, from $34.2 billion in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher levels of private client, commercial and institutional, commercial real estate, non-U.S., and residential real estate loans. Private client loans averaged $14.1 billion and increased $2.3 billion, or 19%, from $11.8 billion for the prior-year quarter. Commercial and institutional loans averaged $11.7 billion and increased $1.8 billion, or 19%, from $9.9 billion for the prior-year quarter. Commercial real estate loans averaged $4.3 billion and increased $643.8 million, or 18%, from $3.7 billion for the prior-year quarter. Non-U.S. loans averaged $2.9 billion and increased $540.6 million or 23%, from $2.3 billion for the prior-year quarter. Residential real estate loans averaged $6.2 billion and increased $66.2 million, or 1%, from $6.1 billion for the prior-year quarter. Northern Trust utilizes a diverse mix of funding sources. Average Interest-Bearing Deposits increased $5.4 billion, or 6%, to an average of $101.4 billion in the current quarter from $96.0 billion in the prior-year quarter. Other Average Interest-Related Funds decreased $2.2 billion, or 22%, to an average of $7.5 billion in the current quarter from $9.7 billion in the prior-year quarter. The balances within short-term borrowing classifications vary based on funding requirements and strategies, interest rate levels, changes in the volume of lower-cost deposit sources, and the availability of collateral to secure these borrowings. Average net noninterest-related funds increased $6.0 billion, or 17%, to $40.9 billion in the current quarter from $34.9 billion in the prior-year quarter, primarily resulting from higher levels of Demand and Other Noninterest-Bearing Deposits. Interest expense for Interest-Bearing Deposits in the current quarter was driven by low and negative interest rates for Non-U.S. Offices Interest-Bearing Deposits and low interest rates on domestic Interest-Bearing Deposits. Average Non-U.S. Offices Interest-Bearing Deposits comprised 67% of total average Interest-Bearing Deposits for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Provision for Credit Losses There was a $2.0 million provision in the current quarter, as compared to a $30.0 million release of credit reserves in the prior-year quarter. The provision in the current quarter was primarily due to an increase in the reserve evaluated on an individual basis for two commercial borrowers, partially offset by a slight decrease in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis. The reserve evaluated on a collective basis relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar risk characteristics. The decrease in the collective basis reserve was primarily due to continued improvements in credit quality mainly within the commercial real estate portfolio, partially offset by increases in the reserve driven by projected economic conditions. The release of credit reserves in the prior-year quarter was primarily due to a decrease in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis driven by continued improvement in projected economic conditions at the time and portfolio credit quality. Decreases in the collective basis reserve were primarily in the commercial and institutional, commercial real estate and private client portfolios. Net recoveries in the current quarter were $3.2 million, reflecting $3.3 million of recoveries and $0.1 million of charge-offs. The prior-year quarter included $0.9 million of net recoveries, reflecting $1.3 million of recoveries and $0.4 million of charge-offs. Nonaccrual assets of $101.0 million decreased $24.3 million, or 19%, from $125.3 million at the end of the prior-year quarter. Commercial real estate, residential real estate, commercial and institutional, and lease financing accounted for 46%, 25%, 18%, and 11%, respectively, of total nonaccrual loans and leases at March 31, 2022. Residential real estate, commercial real estate, commercial and institutional, and private client loans accounted for 48%, 33%, 17%, and 2%, respectively, of total nonaccrual loans and leases at March 31, 2021. For additional discussion of the allowance for credit losses, refer to the “Asset Quality” section in this MD&A. 11 FIRST QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Noninterest Expense Beginning in 2022, Other Operating Expense was impacted by the change in classification of certain amounts previously reported as a reduction of Other Operating Expense to Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees. The impact to Other Operating Expense in the current quarter was $11.6 million relating to amounts now recorded in Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees rather than as a reduction of Other Operating Expenses. Prior-period amounts have not been reclassified. The components of Noninterest Expense are provided in the following table. Compensation expense, the largest component of Noninterest Expense, increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher incentives and salary expense. Outside Services expense increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher technical services costs and consulting services. Equipment and Software expense increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher software support and rental costs and higher amortization. Other Operating Expense increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the accounting reclassification previously discussed, partially offset by lower supplemental compensation plan expense. The lower supplemental compensation plan expense in the prior-year quarter comparison resulted in a related decrease in miscellaneous income reported in noninterest income. Please refer to Note 17 — Other Operating Expense to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for further detail. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was $121.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23.8%, compared to $120.8 million in the prior-year quarter, representing an effective tax rate of 24.4%. The effective tax rate decreased compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to a lower net tax impact from international operations. REPORTING SEGMENTS During the first quarter of 2022, the Corporation changed the name of its C&IS segment to “Asset Servicing.” Accordingly, the disclosures herein and all future disclosures regarding the Corporation’s reporting segments filed with, or furnished to, the SEC will refer to this segment as Asset Servicing. This change has not had, and is not expected in the future to have, any impact upon the methodology by which the Corporation allocates revenue and expense to each of its reporting segments. Northern Trust is organized around its two client-focused reporting segments: Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. Reporting segment financial information, presented on an internal management reporting basis, is determined by accounting systems used to allocate revenue and expense to each segment, and incorporates processes for allocating assets, liabilities, equity and the applicable interest income and expense utilizing a funds transfer pricing (FTP) methodology. Under the methodology, assets and liabilities receive a funding charge or credit that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics on an instrument level. Additionally, segment information is presented on an FTE basis as management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest income. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income. 12 REPORTING SEGMENTS (continued) Revenues, expenses and average assets are allocated to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management, with the exception of non-recurring activities such as certain costs associated with acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, restructuring, and tax adjustments not directly attributable to a specific reporting segment. Reporting segment results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made. The results are also subject to refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies, which are typically reflected on a prospective basis. The following table presents the earnings contributions and average assets of Northern Trust’s reporting segments for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. Asset Servicing Asset Servicing Net Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, Net Income increased $14.7 million, or 9%, from the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees and Net Interest Income, partially offset by higher Noninterest Expense and a Provision for Credit Losses in the current quarter as compared to a release in the prior-year quarter. Asset Servicing Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees For an explanation of Asset Servicing Trust, Investment, and Other Servicing Fees, please see the “Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees” section within the Consolidated Results of Operations section of the MD&A. Asset Servicing Foreign Exchange Trading Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, Foreign Exchange Trading Income increased $2.9 million, or 4%, from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher client volumes and market volatility. Asset Servicing Other Noninterest Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, Other Noninterest Income increased $0.8 million, or 1.3%, from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher Security Commissions and Trading Income, partially offset by lower Other Operating Income. The lower Other Operating Income was driven by the change in classification of certain fees to Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees for which prior-period amounts have not been reclassified. 13 REPORTING SEGMENTS (continued) Asset Servicing (continued) Asset Servicing Net Interest Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, Net Interest Income stated on an FTE basis increased $29.4 million, or 18%, from the prior-year quarter. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily reflected a higher net interest margin and higher average earning asset levels funded by higher deposit balances. Average earning assets increased $5.4 billion to $114.4 billion in the current quarter from $109.0 billion in the prior-year quarter. The earning assets and funding sources in Asset Servicing for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 consisted primarily of intercompany assets and of loans and non-U.S. custodyrelated interest-bearing deposits, respectively. Asset Servicing Provision for Credit Losses For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, there was an $8.4 million Provision for Credit Losses compared to a $5.4 million release of credit reserves in the prioryear quarter. The provision for credit losses in the current quarter was primarily due to an increase in the reserve evaluated on an individual basis and increases in the collective basis reserve driven by projected economic conditions. The reserve evaluated on a collective basis relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar risk characteristics. Asset Servicing Noninterest Expense For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, Noninterest Expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, increased $44.8 million, or 6%, from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher expense allocations, Other Operating Expense, and Compensation expense. The higher Other Operating Expense was due to the change in classification of certain amounts, previously reported as a reduction of Other Operating Expense, to Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees for which prior-periods amounts have not been reclassified. Wealth Management Wealth Management Net Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, Net Income increased $1.3 million, or 1%, from the prior-year quarter primarily due to higher Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees and Net Interest Income, partially offset by higher Noninterest Expense, a lower release of credit reserves, and lower Other Noninterest Income. Wealth Management Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees For an explanation of Wealth Management Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees, please see the “Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees” section within the Consolidated Results of Operations section of the MD&A. Wealth Management Other Noninterest Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, Other Noninterest Income decreased $12.4 million, or 28%, from the prior-year quarter primarily due to lower Other Operating Income driven by lower income allocations and the change in classification of certain fees to Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees for which prior-period amounts have not been reclassified. Wealth Management Net Interest Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, Net Interest Income stated on an FTE basis increased $11.6 million, or 6%, from the prior-year quarter. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was primarily due to higher average loans and deposits balances, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Average earning assets increased $3.8 billion to $35.4 billion in the current quarter from $31.6 billion in the prior-year quarter. Earning assets and funding sources for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 were primarily comprised of loans and domestic interest-bearing deposits, respectively. Wealth Management Provision for Credit Losses For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, there was a $6.4 million release of credit reserves compared to a $24.6 million release of credit reserves in the prior-year quarter. The release of credit reserves for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, was primarily due to a decrease in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis, which relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar risk characteristics. The decrease in the collective basis reserve was driven by continued improvements in portfolio credit quality mainly within the commercial real estate portfolio, partially offset by increases in the reserve driven by projected economic conditions. Wealth Management Noninterest Expense For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, Noninterest Expense, which includes the direct expenses of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, increased $42.0 million or 10% from the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher expense allocations and Compensation expense As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the 6% and 5%, respectively, of HTM debt securities not rated by Moody’s, S&P Global or Fitch Ratings consisted of certificates of deposit with a remaining life of less than six months, as well as investments purchased by Northern Trust to fulfill its obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Northern Trust fulfills its obligations under the CRA by making qualified investments for purposes of supporting institutions and programs that benefit low-to-moderate income communities within Northern Trust’s market area. Net unrealized losses within the investment securities portfolio totaled $1.9 billion at March 31, 2022, compared to net unrealized losses of $187.1 million as of December 31, 2021. Net unrealized losses as of March 31, 2022 were comprised of $62.4 million and $1,999.6 million of gross unrealized gains and losses, respectively. Net unrealized losses as of December 31, 2021 were comprised of $345.1 million and $532.2 million of gross unrealized gains and losses, respectively. As of March 31, 2022, the $36.9 billion AFS debt securities portfolio had unrealized losses of $475.9 million and $256.6 million related to governmentsponsored agency securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions, respectively, which are primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates and credit spreads since their purchase. As of December 31, 2021, the $38.0 billion AFS debt securities portfolio had unrealized losses of $110.2 million related to government-sponsored agency securities, which are primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates and credit spreads since their purchase. As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, 12% and 14%, respectively, of the AFS corporate debt securities portfolio was backed by guarantees provided by U.S. and non-U.S. government entities. As of March 31, 2022, the $21.2 billion HTM debt securities portfolio had unrealized losses of $400.9 million and $208.2 million related to governmentsponsored agency securities and sub-sovereign, supranational and non-U.S. agency bonds, respectively, which are primarily attributable to changes in overall market interest rates and credit spreads since their purchase. As of December 31, 2021, the $23.6 billion HTM debt securities portfolio had an unrealized loss of $106.1 million, $80.0 million and $71.6 million related to government-sponsored agency, sub-sovereign, supranational and non-U.S. agency bonds, and other residential mortgage-backed securities, respectively, which are primarily attributable to changes in overall market interest rates and credit spreads since their purchase. 17 ASSET QUALITY (continued) Securities Portfolio (continued) HTM debt securities consist of securities that management intends to, and Northern Trust has the ability to, hold until maturity. During the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, no securities were transferred from AFS to HTM. Upon transfer of a debt security from the AFS to HTM classification, the amortized cost is reset to fair value. Any net unrealized gain or loss at the date of transfer will remain in AOCI and be amortized into Net Interest Income over the remaining life of the securities using the effective interest method. The amortization of amounts retained in AOCI will offset the effect on interest income of the amortization of the premium or discount resulting from transferring the securities at fair value. For additional information relating to the securities portfolio, refer to Note 4 — Securities to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. To minimize potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. It is Northern Trust’s policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities purchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the counterparty until their repurchase. For additional information relating to the securities sold under agreements to repurchase, refer to Note 5 — Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). Nonaccrual Loans and Leases and Other Real Estate Owned Nonaccrual assets consist of nonaccrual loans and leases and other real estate owned (OREO). OREO is comprised of commercial and residential properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of loans. The following table provides the amounts of nonaccrual loans and leases, by loan and lease segment and class, and of OREO that were outstanding at the dates shown, as well as the balance of loans that were delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest. Loans that are delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest can fluctuate widely based on the timing of cash collections, renegotiation and renewals. ASSET QUALITY (continued) Nonaccrual Loans and Leases and Other Real Estate Owned (continued) Northern Trust’s credit policies do not allow for the origination of loan types generally considered to be high risk in nature, such as option adjustable rate mortgage loans, subprime loans, loans with initial “teaser” rates and loans with excessively high loan-to-value ratios. Residential real estate loans consist of first lien mortgages and equity credit lines, which generally require a loan-to-collateral value of no more than 65% to 80% at inception. Appraisals of supporting collateral for residential real estate loans are obtained at loan origination and upon refinancing or default or when otherwise considered warranted. Residential real estate collateral appraisals are performed and reviewed by independent third parties. The commercial real estate portfolio consists of commercial mortgages and construction, acquisition and development loans extended primarily to experienced investors well known to Northern Trust. Underwriting standards generally reflect conservative loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage requirements. Recourse to owners through guarantees also is commonly required. For additional information relating to the loans and leases portfolio, refer to Note 6 — Loans and Leases to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses—which represents management’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses related to various portfolios subject to credit risk, off-balance-sheet credit exposure, and specific borrower relationships—is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process. Northern Trust measures expected credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. A financial asset is measured individually if it does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets and the related allowance is determined through an individual evaluation. Management’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption. In determining an appropriate allowance level, management evaluates numerous variables, many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates, and takes into consideration past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The results of the credit reserve estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by Northern Trust’s Credit Loss Reserve Committee, which receives input from Credit Risk Management, Treasury, Corporate Finance, the Economic Research group, and each of Northern Trust’s business units. As of March 31, 2022, the allowance for credit losses related to loans and leases, undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit, HTM debt securities, AFS debt securities, and other financial assets, was $136.3 million, $37.5 million, $14.6 million, $0.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the allowance for credit losses related to loans and leases, undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit, HTM debt securities, and other financial assets, was $138.4 million, $34.1 million, $11.2 million, and $1.0 million, respectively. There was no allowance for credit losses related to AFS debt securities as of December 31, 2021. For additional information relating to the allowance for credit losses and the changes in the allowance for credit losses during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 due to charge-offs, recoveries and provisions for credit losses, refer to Note 7 — Allowance for Credit Losses to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). The following table shows the allowance evaluated on an individual and collective basis for the loans and leases portfolio by segment and class. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $746.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to net changes in other operating activities, period earnings, decrease in receivables and the impact of lower non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization, partially offset by higher net collateral deposited with derivative counterparties. Net cash provided by operating activities of $68.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to period earnings, the impact of lower non-cash charges such as amortization and net changes in other operating activities, partially offset by higher net collateral deposited with derivative counterparties. Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities of $10.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to decreased levels of Federal Reserve and other central bank deposits, net proceeds associated with HTM debt securities and lower levels of loans and leases, partially offset by higher levels of interest-bearing deposits with banks and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Net cash provided by investing activities of $5.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to decreased levels of Federal Reserve and other central bank deposits, partially offset by net purchases of debt securities available for sale, client security settlement receivables, and interest-bearing deposits with banks. 20 STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (continued) Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities of $10.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to the decreased levels of total deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. The decrease in total deposits was primarily attributable to lower levels of interest-bearing nonU.S office client deposits, savings, money market and other interest-bearing deposits, and non-U.S. office noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by increased domestic noninterest-bearing deposits. Net cash used in financing activities of $4.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to the decreased levels of total deposits, partially offset by increased levels of short-term borrowings. The decrease in total deposits was primarily attributable to lower levels of interestbearing non-U.S. office client deposits, and savings, money market and other interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by increased non-U.S. and domestic noninterest-bearing deposits. CAPITAL RATIOS The capital ratios of Northern Trust Corporation and its principal subsidiary, The Northern Trust Company, remained strong at March 31, 2022, exceeding the requirements for classification as “well-capitalized” under applicable U.S. regulatory requirements. The results of the 2021 Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test, published by the Federal Reserve on June 24, 2021, resulted in Northern Trust’s stress capital buffer and effective Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio minimum requirement remaining at 2.5% for the annual Capital Plan cycle beginning on October 1, 2021. An increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which was primarily due to an increase in net unrealized losses on the available for sale debt securities portfolio largely from rising interest rates, contributed to the current quarter’s change in capital ratios from the prior period. The table below provides capital ratios, as well as the required minimum capital ratios, for Northern Trust Corporation and The Northern Trust Company determined by Basel III phased-in requirements. In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2022-01, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging— Portfolio Layer Method” (ASU 2022-01). The amendments in ASU 2022-01 expand the current last-of-layer hedging model from a single-layer method to allow multiple hedged layers of a single closed portfolio. To reflect that expansion, the last-of-layer method is renamed the portfolio layer method. In addition, ASU 2022-01 (1) expands the scope of the portfolio layer method to include non-prepayable assets, (2) specifies eligible hedging instruments in a single-layer hedge, (3) provides additional guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of hedge basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method and (4) specifies how hedge basis adjustments should be considered when determining credit losses for the assets included in the closed portfolio. ASU 2022-01 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, although early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, ASU 2022-01 is not expected to have a significant impact on Northern Trust’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2022-02, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures” (ASU 2022-02). The amendments in ASU 2022-02 eliminate the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) for creditors that have adopted CECL while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, ASU 2022-02 requires that a public business entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases. ASU 2022-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, although early adoption is permitted. Northern Trust is currently assessing the impact of adoption of ASU 2022-02. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT There are two types of market risk, interest rate risk associated with the banking book and trading risk. Interest rate risk associated with the banking book is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in net interest income and the market value of equity. Trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions. Northern Trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk: Net Interest Income (NII) sensitivity and Market Value of Equity (MVE) sensitivity. NII sensitivity provides management with a short-term view of the impact of interest rate changes on NII. MVE sensitivity provides management with a long-term view of interest rate changes on MVE based on the period-end balance sheet. As part of its risk management activities, Northern Trust also measures daily the risk of loss associated with all non-U.S. currency positions using a Value-atRisk (VaR) model and applying the historical simulation methodology. The following information about Northern Trust’s management of market risk should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. NII Sensitivity — The modeling of NII sensitivity incorporates on-balance-sheet positions, as well as derivative financial instruments (principally interest rate swaps) that are used to manage interest rate risk. Northern Trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity (i.e., change) of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates. Stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk). The NII sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. The simulation cannot precisely estimate NII sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. The following key assumptions are incorporated into the simulation: ▪ the balance sheet size and mix remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing, with the exception of certain nonmaturity deposits that are considered short-term in nature and therefore receive a more conservative interest-bearing treatment; ▪ prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a third-party mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions; ▪ cash flows for structured securities are estimated using a third-party vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the third-party mortgage analytics vendor; ▪ nonmaturity deposit pricing is projected based on Northern Trust’s actual historical patterns and management judgment, depending upon the availability of historical data and current pricing strategies/or judgment; and ▪ new business rates are based on current spreads to market indices. 22 MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) The following table shows the estimated NII impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point ramps upward and 100 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This report may include statements which constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
