CAUTIONARY NOTICE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

From time to time the Company has made, and in the future will make, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;outlook,&#8221; &#8220;forecast,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; &#8220;trend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;goal,&#8221; or other words of comparable meaning or future-tense or conditional verbs such as &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; or &#8220;could.&#8221; Forward-looking statements convey the Company&#8217;s expectations, intentions, or forecasts about future events, circumstances, results, or aspirations.

This report, including any information incorporated by reference in this report, contains forward-looking statements. The Company also may make forward-looking statements in other documents that are filed or furnished with the SEC. In addition, the Company may make forward-looking statements orally or in writing to investors, analysts, members of the media, or others.

All forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, which may change over time and many of which are beyond the Company&#8217;s control. You should not rely on any forward-looking statement as a prediction or guarantee about the future. Actual future objectives, strategies, plans, prospects, performance, conditions, or results may differ materially from those set forth in any forward-looking statement. While no list of assumptions, risks, or uncertainties could be complete, some of the factors that may cause actual results or other future events, circumstances, or aspirations to differ from those in forward-looking statements include:

Results of Operations

Overview

The Company focuses on the following four core strategic objectives. Management believes these strategic objectives will guide its efforts to achieve its vision, to deliver the unparalleled customer experience, all while seeking to improve net income and strengthen the balance sheet while undertaking prudent risk management.

The first strategic objective is to continuously improve operating efficiencies. The Company has focused on identifying efficiencies that simplify our organizational and reporting structures, streamline back office functions and take advantage of synergies and newer technologies among various platforms and distribution networks. The Company has identified and expects to continue identifying ongoing efficiencies through the normal course of business that, when combined with increased revenue, will contribute to improved operating leverage. For 2019, total revenue increased 8.5 percent, and noninterest expense also increased 8.5 percent, as compared to the previous year. The Company continues to invest in technological advances that it believes will help management drive 

&#160;

operating leverage in the future through improved data analysis and automation. The Company also continues to evaluate core systems and will invest in enhancements that it believes will yield operating efficiencies. 

The second strategic objective is to increase net interest income through profitable loan and deposit growth and the optimization of the balance sheet. For 2019, net interest income increased $60.5 million, or 9.9 percent, as compared to the previous year. The Company has shown increased net interest income through the effects of increased loan volumes and the mix of average earning assets, partially offset by changing interest rate environment. Average loan balances increased $1.2 billion, or 10.0 percent, from prior year. The funding for these assets was driven primarily by a 16.6 percent increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased nine basis points compared to the same period in 2018.

The third strategic objective is to grow the Company&#8217;s revenue from noninterest sources. The Company seeks to grow noninterest revenues throughout all economic and interest rate cycles, while positioning itself to benefit in periods of economic growth. Noninterest income increased $25.1 million, or 6.2 percent, to $426.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. This increase was driven by a combination of revenues in trading and investment banking, brokerage, trust and securities processing, company-owned life insurance, and derivative income. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest income. At December 31, 2019, noninterest income represented 38.9 percent of total revenues, as compared to 39.7 percent at December 31, 2018.

The fourth strategic objective is effective capital management. The Company places a significant emphasis on maintaining a strong capital position, which management believes promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. The Company continues to maximize shareholder value through a mix of reinvesting in organic growth, evaluating acquisition opportunities that complement the Company&#8217;s strategies, increasing dividends over time, and appropriately utilizing a share repurchase program. At December 31, 2019, the Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 13.26 percent and $2.6 billion in total shareholders&#8217; equity, an increase of $378.0 million, or 17.0 percent, compared to total shareholders&#8217; equity at December 31, 2018. The Company repurchased 68 thousand shares of common stock at an average price of $66.19 per share during 2019 and declared $59.6 million in dividends, which represents a 2.3 percent increase compared to dividends declared during 2018.

Earnings Summary

The Company recorded consolidated income from continuing operations of $243.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This represents a 24.1 percent increase over 2018. Income from continuing operations for 2018 was $196.3 million, or an increase of 7.3 percent compared to 2017. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2019, were $4.99 per share compared to $3.98 per share in 2018, an increase of 25.4 percent. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations were $3.72 per share in 2017, or an increase of 7.0 percent from 2017 to 2018. Fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 25.9 percent from 2018 to 2019, and increased 7.4 percent from 2017 to 2018. 

The Company&#8217;s net interest income increased to $670.9 million in 2019 compared to $610.4 million in 2018 and $558.9 million in 2017. In total, a favorable volume variance, partially offset by an unfavorable rate variance, resulted in a $60.5 million increase in net interest income in 2019, compared to 2018. See Table 2 on page 28. The favorable volume variance on earning assets was predominantly driven by the increase in average loan balances of $1.2 billion, or 10.0 percent, for 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 3.12 percent for 2019, compared to 3.21 percent for the same period in 2018, as the cost of the Company&#8217;s interest-bearing liabilities increased at a greater pace than the yields on interest-earning assets. The Company has seen an increase in the benefit from interest-free funds as compared to 2018. The impact of this benefit increased 10 basis points compared to 2018 and is illustrated on Table 3 on page 29. The magnitude and duration of this impact will be largely dependent upon the FRB&#8217;s policy decisions and market movements. See Table 20 in Item 7A on page 50 for an illustration of the impact of an interest rate increase or decrease on net interest income as of December 31, 2019.

The provision for loan loss totaled $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is a decrease of $37.9 million, or 53.6 percent, compared to the same period in 2018. This decrease was driven primarily by higher provision to cover the loss related to a single factoring credit relationship recorded in 2018. See further discussion in &#8220;Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses&#8221; on page 29. 

&#160;

The Company had an increase of $25.1 million, or 6.2 percent, in noninterest income in 2019, as compared to 2018, and a decrease of $21.9 million, or 5.2 percent, in 2018, compared to 2017. The increase in 2019 is primarily attributable to trading and investment banking, brokerage, trust and securities processing, company-owned life insurance, and derivative income. The change in company-owned life insurance income is offset by a proportionate change in deferred compensation expense recorded in noninterest expense. The change in noninterest income in 201 9 from 201 8 , and 201 8 from 201 7 is illustrated in Table 6 on page 3 2 . 

Noninterest expense increased in 2019 by $61.1 million, or 8.5 percent, compared to 2018 and increased by $12.7 million, or 1.8 percent, in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in 2019 is primarily driven by increases in salary and employee benefits expense, processing fees, and equipment expense. The increase in noninterest expense in 2019 from 2018, and 2018 from 2017 is illustrated in Table 7 on page 33.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is a significant source of the Company&#8217;s earnings and represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds the interest expense paid on liabilities. The volume of interest earning assets and the related funding sources, the overall mix of these assets and liabilities, and the interest rates paid on each affect net interest income. Table 2 summarizes the change in net interest income resulting from changes in volume and rates for 2019, 2018 and 2017. 

Net interest margin, presented in Table 1 on page 26, is calculated as net interest income on a fully tax- equivalent basis (FTE) as a percentage of average earning assets. Net interest income is presented on a tax-equivalent basis to adjust for the tax-exempt status of earnings from certain loans and investments, which are primarily obligations of state and local governments. A critical component of net interest income and related net interest margin is the percentage of earning assets funded by interest-free sources. Table 3 analyzes net interest margin for the three years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Net interest income, average balance sheet amounts and the corresponding yields earned and rates paid for the years 2017 through 2019 are presented in Table 1 below.

&#160;

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the average earning assets and resulting yields, as well as the average interest-bearing liabilities and resulting yields, expressed in both dollars and rates.

##TABLE_START (1) 

Interest income and yields are stated on a fully tax-equivalent (FTE) basis, using a marginal tax rate of 21% for 2019 and 2018, while a rate of 35% was used for 2017. The tax-equivalent interest income and yields give effect to tax-exempt interest income net of the disallowance of interest expense, for federal income tax purposes related to certain tax-free assets. Rates earned/paid may not compute to the rates shown due to presentation in millions. The tax-equivalent interest income totaled $24.0 million, $20.0 million, and $39.5 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (2) 

Loan fees are included in interest income. Such fees totaled $14.5 million, $17.0 million, and $15.4 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (3) 

Loans on non-accrual are included in the computation of average balances. Interest income on these loans is also included in loan income.

Table 2 

RATE-VOLUME ANALYSIS (in thousands) 

This analysis attributes changes in net interest income either to changes in average balances or to changes in average interest rates for earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The change in net interest income that is due to both volume and interest rate has been allocated to volume and interest rate in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of the change in each. All interest rates are presented on a tax-equivalent basis and give effect to tax-exempt interest income net of the disallowance of interest expense for federal income tax purposes, related to certain tax-free assets. The loan average balances and rates include nonaccrual loans.

&#160;

The Company experienced an increase in net interest income of $60.5 million, or 9.9 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. This follows an increase of $51.5 million, or 9.2 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017. Average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $2.6 billion, or 13.5 percent, compared to the same period in 2018. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 3.12 percent for 2019 compared to 3.21 percent in 2018. 

The Company funds a significant portion of its balance sheet with noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits represented 32.1 percent, 34.6 percent and 37.9 percent of total outstanding deposits at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As illustrated in Table 3, the impact from these interest-free funds was 43 basis points in 2019, as compared to 33 basis points in 2018 and 18 basis points in 2017. 

The Company has experienced an increase in net interest income during 2019 due to a volume variance of $71.1 million offset by a negative rate variance of $10.7 million. The average rate on earning assets during 2019 has increased by 15 basis points, while the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 34 basis points, resulting in a 19 basis-point decrease in spread. The volume of loans has increased from an average of $11.6 billion in 2018 to an average of $12.8 billion in 2019. Loan-related earning assets tend to generate a higher spread than those earned in the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio. By design, the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio is moderate in duration and liquid in its composition of assets.

During 2020, approximately $1.1 billion of available for sale securities are expected to have principal repayments. This includes approximately $333 million which will have principal repayments during the first quarter of 2020. The available for sale investment portfolio had an average life of 70.9 months, 56.8 months, and 51.7 months as of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. 

Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses (ALL) represents management&#8217;s judgment of the losses inherent in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. An analysis is performed quarterly to determine the appropriate balance of the ALL. The analysis reflects loan quality trends, including the levels of and trends related to non-accrual loans, past due loans, potential problem loans, criticized loans and net charge-offs or recoveries, among other factors. After the balance sheet analysis is performed for the ALL, the provision for loan losses is computed as the amount required to adjust the ALL to the appropriate level.

Table 4 presents the components of the allowance by loan portfolio segment. The Company manages the ALL against the risk in the entire loan portfolio and therefore, the allocation of the ALL to a particular loan segment may change in the future. Management of the Company believes the present ALL is adequate considering the Company&#8217;s loss experience, delinquency trends and current economic conditions. Future economic conditions and borrowers&#8217; ability to meet their obligations, however, are uncertainties which could affect the Company&#8217;s ALL and/or need to change its current level of provision. For more information on loan portfolio segments and ALL methodology refer to Note 3, &#8220;Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses,&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

&#160;

Table 4 

ALLOCATION OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES (in thousands) 

This table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan portfolio segment, which represents the inherent probable loss derived by both quantitative and qualitative methods. The amounts presented are not necessarily indicative of actual future charge-offs in any particular category and are subject to change.

Table 5 presents a five-year summary of the Company&#8217;s ALL. Also, please see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8212;Credit Risk Management&#8221; on page 53 in this report for information relating to nonaccrual, past due, restructured loans, and other credit risk matters. For more information on loan portfolio segments and ALL methodology refer to Note 3, &#8220;Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses,&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As illustrated in Table 5 below, the ALL decreased as a percentage of total loans to 0.76 percent as of December 31, 2019, compared to 0.85 percent as of December 31, 2018. The provision for loan loss totaled $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is a decrease of $37.9 million, or 53.6 percent, compared to the same period in 2018. This decrease was driven by higher provision to cover the loss related to a single factoring credit relationship in 2018. The provision for loan losses totaled $70.8 million and $41.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Noninterest Income

A key objective of the Company is the growth of noninterest income to provide a diverse source of revenue not directly tied to interest rates. Fee-based services are typically non-credit related and are not generally affected by fluctuations in interest rates. Noninterest income increased in 2019 by $25.1 million, or 6.2 percent, compared to 2018 and decreased in 2018 by $21.9 million, or 5.2 percent, compared to 2017. The increase in 2019 is primarily attributable to trading and investment banking, brokerage, trust and securities processing, company-owned life insurance, and derivative income. The decrease in 2018 is primarily attributable to trading and investment banking, trust and securities processing, bankcard income, gains on sales of available-for-sale securities, and service charges on deposit accounts.

The Company&#8217;s fee-based services offer multiple products and services, which management believes will more closely align with customer product demands. The Company is currently emphasizing fee-based services including trust and securities processing, bankcard, securities trading and brokerage and cash and treasury management. Management believes that it can offer these products and services both efficiently and profitably, as most have common platforms and support structures.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

Noninterest income and the year-over-year changes in noninterest income are summarized in Table 6 above. The dollar change and percent change columns highlight the respective net increase or decrease in the categories of noninterest income in 2019 compared to 2018, and in 2018 compared to 2017. 

Trust and securities processing income consists of fees earned on personal and corporate trust accounts, custody of securities services, trust investments and wealth management services, and mutual fund assets servicing. This income category increased by $4.8 million, or 2.8 percent in 2019, compared to 2018, and decreased by $4.5 million, or 2.5 percent, in 2018, compared to 2017. During 2019, corporate trust revenue increased $6.9 million, partially offset by a decrease of $1.4 million in fee income from fund services fees. During 2018, fee income from fund services fees decreased $7.5 million and wealth management services decreased $1.0 million. These decreases were offset by an increase in corporate trust income of $4.0 million as compared to 2017. 

Trading and investment banking income increased $7.9 million, or 50.6 percent, in 2019 compared to 2018 and decreased $7.6 million, or 32.8 percent, in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in 2019 compared to 2018 and the decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 was driven by increased and decreased bond trading income, respectively. 

Brokerage fees increased $5.5 million, or 21.1 percent, in 2019 compared to 2018 and increased $2.6 million, or 11.2 percent, in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in money market and 12b-1 income driven by an increase in volume and interest rates. 

Bankcard fees decreased $1.8 million, or 2.6 percent, in 2019 compared to 2018, and decreased $4.5 million, or 6.2 percent, in 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by increased rebate expense. The decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 was driven by increased rewards and rebate expense, partially offset by increased interchange revenue. 

Gains on sales of securities available for sale increased $2.6 million in 2019 compared to 2018 and decreased by $3.6 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The Company&#8217;s goal in the management of its available-for-sale securities portfolio is to maximize return within the Company&#8217;s parameters of liquidity goals, interest rate risk and credit risk. This can result in differences from period to period in the amount of realized gains.

Other noninterest income increased $7.3 million, or 21.9 percent, in 2019 compared to 2018 and decreased $0.2 million, or 0.5 percent, in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase from 2018 to 2019 was driven by an increase in company-owned life insurance and derivative income. The decrease from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in company-owned life insurance income, partially offset by gains on sales of assets. Changes in company-owned life insurance are offset by proportionate changes in deferred compensation expense noted below. 

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense increased in 2019 by $61.1 million, or 8.5 percent, compared to 2018 and increased in 2018 by $12.7 million, or 1.8 percent, compared to 2017. From 2018 to 2019 the increases were driven by salary and employee benefits expense, processing fees, and equipment expense. The main drivers of the increase from 

&#160;

2017 to 2018 were legal and consulting expense, salaries and employee benefits expense, processing fees, and equipment expense. Table 7 below summarizes the components of noninterest expense and the respective year-over-year changes for each category. &#160;

Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $42.4 million, or 10.1 percent, in 2019 compared to 2018 and $5.3 million, or 1.3 percent, in 2018 compared to 2017. In 2019, employee benefits expense increased $16.1 million, or 23.8 percent, driven by higher deferred compensation expense. Salary and wage expense increased $14.4 million, or 5.3 percent, and bonus and commission expense increased $11.9 million, or 14.6 percent. These increases are driven by increased employee headcount, and increased bonus and sales commission expense tied to business volumes and revenue growth, and overall company performance. In 2018, salary and wage expense increased $11.1 million, or 4.3 percent, and bonus and commission expense increased $1.7 million, or 2.2 percent. These increases were offset by decreased employee benefit expense of $7.6 million, or 10.1 percent, driven by lower deferred compensation expense.

Equipment expense increased $3.9 million, or 5.2 percent, and $3.2 million, or 4.4 percent in 2019 and 2018, respectively. This increase is driven by increased computer hardware and software expenses for the ongoing investments in digital channel and integrated platform solutions to support business growth and the continued modernization of the Company&#8217;s core systems in both years.

Processing fees expense increased $5.2 million, or 11.1 percent, in 2019 compared to 2018, and increased $4.6 million, or 11.0 percent, in 2018 compared to 2017. The increases in 2019 and 2018 are primarily driven by ongoing investments in digital channel and integrated platform solutions to support business growth and the continued modernization of the Company&#8217;s core systems. 

Legal and consulting expense increased $1.6 million, or 5.5 percent, in 2019 compared to 2018 and $6.5 million, or 27.6 percent, in 2018 compared to 2017. This increase in 2019 was driven by an increase of $1.4 million in legal and professional services expense. The increase in 2018 was driven by an increase of $5.4 million in consulting expense and an increase of $1.1 million in legal and professional services expense.

Other noninterest expense increased $2.2 million, or 8.6 percent, and decreased $3.1 million, or 11.1 percent, in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in 2019 is primarily driven by higher operational losses, offset by lower other real estate and repossession expenses. The decrease in 2018 was driven by lower operational losses compared to 2017. 

Income Taxes

Income tax expense for continuing operations totaled $42.4 million, $27.3 million, and $53.4 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively. These amounts equate to effective tax rates of 14.8 percent, 12.2 percent, and 22.6 percent for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in effective rate from 2017 to 2018 was primarily a 

&#160;

result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), which lowered the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, effective January 1, 2018. The decrease in 2018 is also attributable to a discrete tax benefit of $5.1 million related to 2017 federal provision-to-return adjustments. Of this amount, $5.0 million was due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities upon completion of the 2017 federal tax return during the fourth quarter of 2018. There was no corresponding adjustment in 2019, resulting in a higher effective tax rate for 2019. 

For further information on income taxes refer to Note 17, &#8220;Income Taxes,&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business Segments

The Company has strategically aligned its operations into the following four reportable segments: Commercial Banking, Institutional Banking, Personal Banking, and Healthcare Services (collectively, the Business Segments). Senior executive officers regularly evaluate Business Segment financial results produced by the Company&#8217;s internal reporting system in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance for individual Business Segments. The management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each Business Segment using methodologies that are refined on an ongoing basis.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, Commercial Banking income from continuing operations increased by $49.9 million, or 41.3 percent, to $170.7 million compared to the same period in 2018. Net interest income increased $32.0 million, or 8.4 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily driven by strong loan growth, increased interest rates, and earning asset mix changes. Provision for loan losses decreased by $37.7 million as compared to 2018. This decrease was driven by the increased provision in 2018 to cover the loss related to a single factoring credit relationship, and is consistent with our methodology, which considers the inherent risk in our loan portfolio, as well as other qualitative factors, such as macroeconomic conditions, loan growth, loan impairment changes, loan risk grading changes, and net charge-off levels. Noninterest income increased $6.7 million, or 8.9 percent, over the same period in 2018 primarily driven by an increase of $4.9 million in company-owned life insurance income and $3.3 million in derivative income, partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest income of $1.8 million due to the write-down of investments in certain small business investments. Noninterest expense increased $13.6 million, or 5.4 percent, to $267.3 million. This increase is primarily due to increased technology, service, and overhead expenses of $6.8 million, an increase of $4.4 million in salary and employee benefit expense and an increase of $1.0 million in legal and consulting expense.

&#160;

For the year ended December 31, 2019, Institutional Banking income from continuing operations increased $4.3 million, or 9.9 percent, compared to the same period last year. Net interest income increased $13.6 million, or 20.4 percent, compared to the same period last year, due to an increase in funds transfer pricing driven by higher interest rates. Provision for loan losses declined $0.4 million, or 27.0 percent, consistent with our methodology, which considers the inherent risk in our loan portfolio, as well as other qualitative factors, such as macroeconomic conditions, loan growth, loan impairment changes, loan risk grading changes, and net charge-off levels. Noninterest income increased $22.3 million, or 12.9 percent. This increase was driven by an increase in bond trading fees of $7.6 million due to higher trading volume, an increase of $6.2 million in brokerage fees due to increased 12b-1 and money market revenue, and an increase of $6.1 million trust and securities pricing due to increased corporate trust income. Additionally, there was a $1.3 million increase in income from company-owned life insurance. Noninterest expense increased $29.8 million, or 15.7 percent, primarily driven by an increase of $13.2 million in salary and employee benefits expense. This increase was driven by increased employee headcount, and increased bonus and sales commission expense tied to business volumes and revenue growth. Additionally, there was an increase of $8.7 million in technology, service, and overhead expense for investments to support growth across the segment&#8217;s lines of business, and increased other noninterest expense of $3.5 million, primarily due to operational losses in 2019. Increases in legal and consulting expense and marketing and business development expense of $1.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively, also contributed to the variance.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, Personal Banking income from continuing operations decreased $14.3 million, compared to the same period last year. Net interest income increased $7.0 million, or 5.6 percent, compared to the same period last year due to increased interest rates. Provision for loan losses remained flat.

These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $2.2 million in company-owned life insurance. Noninterest expense increased $17.7 million, or 7.8 percent, primarily due to an increase of $14.0 million in technology, service, and overhead expense for investments to support growth across the segment&#8217;s lines of business , an increase of $2.7 million in salary and employee benefits expense, and an increase of $1.7 million in supplies and services expense.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, Healthcare Services income from continuing operations increased $7.5 million, or 35.0 percent, compared to the same period last year. Net interest income increased $7.9 million, or 20.4 percent, compared to the same period last year, due to an increase in number of accounts and deposits, coupled with increased funds transfer pricing credits on deposits from higher interest rates. The impact of higher interest rates increased competitive pressures from traditional and non-traditional participants, and industry consolidation will likely impact the future levels of net interest income in this segment. Noninterest income increased $1.7 million, or 4.8 percent, compared to the same period last year, driven by higher company-owned life insurance and bankcard fee income. Noninterest expense remained flat with an increase of $1.8 million in technology, service, and overhead expense for investments to support growth across the segment&#8217;s lines of business , offset by a decrease of $1.4 million in salary and employee benefits expense due to reduced headcount, and a decrease of $0.4 million in processing fees expense.

Balance Sheet Analysis

Loans and Loans Held For Sale

Loans represent the Company&#8217;s largest source of interest income. Loan balances held for investment increased by $1.3 billion, or 10.3 percent, in 2019. This increase was primarily driven by an increase of $614.4 million, or 16.5 percent, in commercial real estate loans, $613.6 million, or 11.7 percent, in commercial loans, and $225.8 million, or 31.9 percent in residential real estate loans. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $91.0 million, or 34.8 percent in factoring loans and $88.5 million, or 23.2 percent in asset-based loans.

Included in Table 12 is a five-year breakdown of loans by type. Business-related loans continue to represent the largest segment of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio, comprising approximately 8 6.8 percent and 86.6 percent of total loans and loans held for sale at the end of 201 9 and 201 8 , respectively. 

Commercial loans represent the largest percent of total loans. Commercial loans at December 31, 2019 have increased $613.6 million, or 11.7 percent, as compared to December 31, 2018, to 43.5 percent of total loans. Commercial loans represented 42.9 percent of total loans at December 31, 2018. 

As a percentage of total loans, commercial real estate and construction real estate loans now comprise 38.5 percent of total loans compared to 37.0 percent in 2018. Commercial real estate loans increased $614.4 million, or 16.5 percent, and construction real estate loans increased $49.8 million, or 6.3 percent, compared to 2018. Generally, these loans are made for working capital or expansion purposes and are primarily secured by real estate with a maximum loan-to-value of 80 percent. Most of these properties are owner-occupied and/or have other collateral or guarantees as security.

Residential real estate increased $225.8 million, or 31.9 percent, and represented 6.9 percent of total loans. HELOC loans decreased $67.6 million, or 12.4 percent, and represent 3.6 percent of total loans.

Asset-based loans decreased $88.5 million, or 23.2 percent, and represented 2.2 percent of total loans as of December 31, 2019. Factoring loans decreased $91.0 million, or 34.8 percent, and represented 1.3 percent of total loans as of December 31, 2019.

Nonaccrual, past due and restructured loans are discussed under &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk &#8211; Credit Risk Management&#8221; in Item 7A on page 53 of this report.

Investment Securities

The Company&#8217;s investment portfolio contains trading, available-for-sale (AFS), and held-to-maturity (HTM) securities as well as FRB stock, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock, and other miscellaneous investments. Investment securities totaled $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 and $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2018 and comprised 35.1 percent and 36.3 percent of the Company&#8217;s earning assets, respectively, as of those dates. 

The Company&#8217;s AFS securities portfolio comprised 85.4 percent of the Company&#8217;s investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2019, compared to 83.4 percent at year-end 2018. The Company&#8217;s AFS securities portfolio provides liquidity as a result of the composition and average life of the underlying securities. This liquidity can be used to fund loan growth or to offset the outflow of traditional funding sources. The average life of the AFS securities portfolio increased from 56.8 months at December 31, 2018 to 70.9 months at December 31, 2019 due to portfolio mix changes, extension in the portfolio related to slower projected prepayments, and buying longer tenor securities. In addition to providing a potential source of liquidity, the AFS securities portfolio can be used as a tool to manage interest rate sensitivity. The Company&#8217;s goal in the management of its AFS securities portfolio is to maximize return within the Company&#8217;s parameters of liquidity goals, interest rate risk and credit risk. 

Management expects collateral pledging requirements for public funds, loan demand, and deposit funding to be the primary factors impacting changes in the level of AFS securities. There were $5.8 billion of AFS securities pledged to secure U.S. Government deposits, other public deposits, certain trust deposits, derivative transactions, and repurchase agreements at December 31, 2019. Of this amount, securities with a market value of $481.2 million at December 31, 2019 were pledged at the Federal Reserve Discount Window but were unencumbered as of that date.

The Company&#8217;s HTM securities portfolio consists of private placement bonds, which are issued primarily to refinance existing revenue bonds in the healthcare and education sectors. The HTM portfolio totaled $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2019, a decrease of $54.5 million, or 4.7 percent, from December 31, 2018. The average life of the HTM portfolio was 6.3 years at December 31, 2019, compared to 6.9 years at December 31, 2018.

The securities portfolio generates the Company&#8217;s second largest component of interest income. The AFS and HTM securities portfolios achieved an average yield on a tax-equivalent basis of 2.64 percent for 2019, compared to 2.41 percent in 2018, and 2.45 percent in 2017. Securities available for sale had a net unrealized gain of $123.4 million at year-end, compared to a net unrealized loss of $127.3 million the preceding year. This market value change primarily reflects the impact of a larger portfolio size, longer average life, and declining market interest rates 

&#160;

as of December 31, 201 9 , compared to December 31, 201 8 . These amounts are reflected, o n an after-tax basis, in the Company&#8217;s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders&#8217; equity , as an unrealized gain of $ 93.7 million at year-end 201 9 , compared to an unrealized loss of $ 96.0 million for 201 8 . The AFS securities portfolio contains securities that have unrealized losses and are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired (see the table of these securities in Note 4, &#8220;Securities,&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 7 7 of this document). The unrealized losses in the Company&#8217;s investments in direct obligations of U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agencies, federal agency mortgage-backed securities, and municipal securities were caused by changes in interest rates. The Company does not have the intent to sell these securities and does not believe it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities before a recovery of fair value. The Company expects to recover its cost basis in the securities and does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 201 9 . 

Included in Tables 13 and 14 are analyses of the cost, fair value and average yield (tax-equivalent basis) of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity.

&#160;

Other marketable and non-marketable securities include PCM alternative investments in hedge funds and private equity funds, which are accounted for as equity-method investments. The Company&#8217;s investment in other marketable securities was fully distributed during 2019. As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of other marketable securities included alternative investment securities of $4.4 million. The fair value of other non-marketable securities includes the alternative investment securities fair value of $7.0 million and $5.8 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 

Other Earning Assets

Federal funds transactions essentially are overnight loans between financial institutions, which allow for either the daily investment of excess funds or the daily borrowing of another institution&#8217;s funds in order to meet short-term liquidity needs. The net borrowed position was $28.9 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $6.2 million at December 31, 2018. 

The Bank buys and sells federal funds as agent for non-affiliated banks. Because the transactions are pursuant to agency arrangements, these transactions do not appear on the balance sheet and averaged $239.2 million in 2019 and $171.3 million in 2018.

At December 31, 2019, the Company held securities purchased under agreements to resell of $1.6 billion compared to $626.5 million at December 31, 2018. The Company uses these instruments as short-term secured investments, in lieu of selling federal funds, or to acquire securities required for collateral purposes. Balances will fluctuate based on the Company&#8217;s liquidity and investment decisions as well as the Company&#8217;s correspondent bank borrowing levels. These investments averaged $533.1 million in 2019 and $172.1 million in 2018.

The Company also maintains an active securities trading inventory. The average holdings in the securities trading inventory in 2019 were $52.3 million, compared to $49.3 million in 2018, and were recorded at fair market value. As discussed in &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk &#8211; Trading Account&#8221; in Part II, Item 7A on page 52, the Company offsets the trading account securities by the sale of exchange-traded financial futures contracts, with both the trading account and futures contracts marked to market daily.

Interest-bearing due from banks totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2019 compared to $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 and includes amounts due from the FRB and interest-bearing accounts held at other financial institutions. The amount due from the FRB averaged $560.9 million and $396.0 million during December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the FRB balance from 2018 to 2019 is primarily due to an increase in public fund and institutional deposit balances. The interest-bearing accounts held at other financial institutions totaled $29.3 million and $18.8 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

&#160;

Deposits and Borrowed Funds 

Deposits represent the Company&#8217;s primary funding source for its asset base. In addition to the core deposits garnered by the Company&#8217;s retail branch structure, the Company continues to focus on its cash management services, as well as its asset management and mutual fund servicing businesses in order to attract and retain additional core deposits. Deposits totaled $21.6 billion at December 31, 2019 and $19.3 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.3 billion, or 12.0 percent. Deposits averaged $19.3 billion in 2019, and $17.0 billion in 2018.

Noninterest-bearing demand deposits averaged $6.1 billion in 2019 and $5.8 billion in 2018. These deposits represented 31.8 percent of average deposits in 2019, compared to 34.3 percent in 2018. The Company&#8217;s large commercial customer base provides a significant source of noninterest-bearing deposits. Many of these commercial accounts do not earn interest&#59; however, they receive an earnings credit to offset the cost of other services provided by the Company.

Long-term debt totaled $97.5 million at December 31, 2019. The majority of the Company&#8217;s long-term debt was assumed from the acquisition of Marquette and consists of debt obligations payable to four unconsolidated trusts (Marquette Capital Trust I, Marquette Capital Trust II, Marquette Capital Trust III, and Marquette Capital Trust IV) that previously issued trust preferred securities. These long-term debt obligations had an aggregate contractual balance of $103.1 million and had a carrying value of $70.4 million at December 31, 2019. Interest rates on trust preferred securities are tied to the three-month LIBOR with spreads ranging from 133 basis points to 160 basis points, and reset quarterly. The trust preferred securities have maturity dates ranging from January 2036 to September 2036. For further information on long-term debt refer to Note 9, &#8220;Borrowed Funds,&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

The Company places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of a strong capital position, which it believes promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. Higher levels of liquidity, however, bear corresponding costs, measured in terms of lower yields on short-term, more liquid earning assets and higher expenses for extended liability maturities. The Company manages capital for each subsidiary based upon the subsidiary&#8217;s respective risks and growth opportunities as well as regulatory requirements.

Total shareholders&#8217; equity increased $378.0 million, or 17.0 percent to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. 

The Board authorized, at its April 23, 2019, April 24, 2018, and April 25, 2017 meetings, the repurchase of up to two million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock during the twelve months following each meeting (each a Repurchase Authorization). During 2019 and 2018, the Company acquired 67,923 shares and 1,136,594 shares, respectively, of its common stock pursuant to the applicable Repurchase Authorization. During 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) to repurchase an aggregate of $50.0 million of the Company&#8217;s common stock through an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ASR). Under the ASR, the Company repurchased a total of 780,321 shares and the ASR was entered into pursuant to the April 24, 2018 Repurchase Authorization. The Company has not made any repurchase of its securities other than pursuant to the Repurchase Authorizations.

&#160;

Through the Company&#8217;s relationship with the FHLB of Des Moines, the Company owns $10.0 million of FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding sources through FHLB advances. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the Company places at the FHLB. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $ 1.2 b ill ion as of December 31, 201 9 . The Company had no outstanding FHLB advances at FHLB of Des Moines as of December 31, 201 9 . 

Risk-based capital guidelines established by regulatory agencies set minimum capital standards based on the level of risk associated with a financial institution&#8217;s assets. The Company has implemented the Basel III regulatory capital rules adopted by the FRB. Basel III capital rules include a minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5 percent and a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6 percent. A financial institution&#8217;s total capital is also required to equal at least 8 percent of risk-weighted assets. 

The risk-based capital guidelines indicate the specific risk weightings by type of asset. Certain off-balance sheet items (such as standby letters of credit and binding loan commitments) are multiplied by credit conversion factors to translate them into balance sheet equivalents before assigning them specific risk weightings. The Company is also required to maintain a leverage ratio equal to or greater than 4 percent. The leverage ratio is tier 1 core capital to total average assets less goodwill and intangibles. The Company's capital position as of December 31, 2019 is summarized in the table below and exceeded regulatory requirements.

For further discussion of capital and liquidity, see the &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk &#8211; Liquidity Risk&#8221; in Item 7A on page 54 of this report.

RISK-BASED CAPITAL (in thousands) 

This table computes risk-based capital in accordance with current regulatory guidelines. These guidelines as of December 31, 2019, excluded net unrealized gains or losses on securities available for sale from the computation of regulatory capital and the related risk-based capital ratios.

Commitments, Contractual Obligations and Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company&#8217;s main off-balance sheet arrangements are loan commitments, commercial and standby letters of credit, futures contracts and forward exchange contracts, which have maturity dates rather than payment due dates. These commitments and contingent liabilities are not required to be recorded on the Company&#8217;s balance sheet. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and lending and financing arrangements may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. See Table 19 below, as well as Note 15, &#8220;Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 on pages 95 through 97 for detailed information and further discussion of these arrangements. Management does not anticipate any material losses from its off-balance sheet arrangements.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

As of December 31, 2019, our total liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits were $5.8 million. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the settlement of these liabilities. Therefore, these liabilities have been excluded from the table above. See Note 17, &#8220;Income Taxes,&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to customers and suppliers, allowance for loan losses, bad debts, investments, financing operations, long-lived assets, taxes, other contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Under different assumptions or conditions, actual results may differ from the recorded estimates. 

Management believes that the Company&#8217;s critical accounting policies are those relating to: the allowance for loan losses and fair value measurements. 

Allowance for Loan Losses

The Company&#8217;s allowance for loan losses represents management&#8217;s judgment of the loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is reviewed quarterly, considering both quantitative and qualitative factors such as historical trends, internal risk ratings, migration analysis, concentrations of credit, current economic conditions, loan growth and individual impairment testing.

Larger commercial loans are individually reviewed for potential impairment. For these loans, if management deems it probable that the borrower cannot meet its contractual obligations with respect to payment or timing such loans are deemed to be impaired under current accounting standards. Such loans are then reviewed for potential impairment based on management&#8217;s estimate of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan given the availability of cash flows, collateral and other legal options. Any allowance related to the impairment of an individually impaired loan is based on the present value of discounted expected future cash flows, the fair value of the underlying collateral, or the fair value of the loan. Based on this analysis, some loans that are classified as impaired do not have a specific allowance as the discounted expected future cash flows or the fair value of the underlying collateral exceeds the Company&#8217;s basis in the impaired loan.

The Company also maintains an internal risk grading system for other loans not subject to individual impairment. An estimate of the inherent loan losses on such risk-graded loans is based on a migration analysis which computes the net charge-off experience related to each risk category. 

&#160;

An estimate of inherent losses is computed on remaining loans based on the type of loan. Each type of loan is segregated into a pool based on the nature of such loans. This includes remaining commercial loans that have a low risk grade, as well as other homogenous loans. Homogenous loans include automobile loans, credit card loans and other consumer loans. Allowances are established for each pool based on the loan type using historical loss rates, certain statistical measures and loan growth. 

An estimate of the total inherent loss is based on the above three computations. From this an adjustment can be made based on other factors management considers to be important in evaluating the probable losses in the portfolio such as general economic conditions, loan trends, risk management and loan administration and changes in internal policies. For more information on loan portfolio segments and ALL methodology refer to Note 3, &#8220;Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses,&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fair Value Measurements

Fair value is measured in accordance with GAAP, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value include the market approach, income approach and cost approach. The market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach involves discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based on current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset. 

GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). An instrument&#8217;s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instrument&#8217;s fair value measurement. The three levels within the fair value hierarchy are described as follows: 

Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are available at the measurement date. 

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets&#59; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active&#59; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability&#59; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for which there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include the Company&#8217;s own financial data such as internally developed pricing models and discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires significant management judgment. 

The Company&#8217;s fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are observable, when available, and the most significant of which include available-for-sale and trading securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Fair value pricing information obtained from third party data providers and pricing services for investment securities is reviewed for appropriateness on a periodic basis. The third party service providers are also analyzed to understand and evaluate the valuation methodologies utilized. This review includes an analysis of current market prices compared to pricing provided by the third party pricing service to assess the relative accuracy of the data provided.

Impact of Future Accounting Pronouncements

New accounting policies adopted by the Company are discussed in Note 2, &#8220;Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted are discussed below. 

&#160;

Credit Losses In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, &#8220;Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.&#8221; This update replaces the current incurred loss methodology for recognizing credit losses with a current expected credit loss model, which requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This amendment broadens the information that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit loss estimates. Additionally, the update amends the accounting for credit losses for available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination. This update requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of a company&#8217;s loan portfolio. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendment requires the use of the modified retrospective approach for adoption. 

The Company&#8217;s implementation plan included a cross-functional working group, including our credit, finance, and risk management departments, to address the adoption and implementation of this amendment. Based on analysis performed by the Company, the Day 1 impact of adopting ASU 2016-13 will be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company estimates the cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax, to be approximately $7.0 million, an increase to the allowance for loan losses of approximately 10 percent and a decrease to the common equity tier 1 capital ratio of approximately four basis points.
