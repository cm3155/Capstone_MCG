This Form 10-Q, including any information incorporated by reference in this Form 10-Q, contains forward-looking statements. The Company also may make forward-looking statements in other documents that are filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

All forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, which may change over time and many of which are beyond the Company&#8217;s control. You should not rely on any forward-looking statement as a prediction or guarantee about the future. Actual future objectives, strategies, plans, prospects, performance, conditions, or results may differ materially from those set forth in any forward-looking statement.

Overview

The rapid rise in interest rates during 2022 and in the first quarter of 2023, the resulting industry-wide reduction in the fair value of securities portfolios, and the recent bank runs that led to the failures of some financial 

&#160;

institutions in March of 2023, among other events, have resulted in a current state of volatility and uncertainty with respect to the health of the U.S. banking system. There is heighted awareness around liquidity, uninsured deposits, deposit comp osition, unrecognized investment losses, and capital. See further discussion around these items in the remaining sections of the Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The Company focuses on the following four core financial objectives. Management believes these objectives will guide its efforts to achieve its vision, to deliver the Unparalleled Customer Experience, all while seeking to improve net income and strengthen the balance sheet while undertaking prudent risk management.

The first financial objective is to continuously improve operating efficiencies. The Company has focused on identifying efficiencies that simplify our organizational and reporting structures, streamline back-office functions, and take advantage of synergies and newer technologies among various platforms and distribution networks. The Company has identified and expects to continue identifying ongoing efficiencies through the normal course of business that, when combined with increased revenue, will contribute to improved operating leverage. During the first quarter of 2023, total revenue increased $37.9 million, or 11.3%, as compared to the first quarter of 2022, while noninterest expense increased $22.3 million, or 10.4%, for the same period. As part of the initiative to improve operating efficiencies, the Company continues to invest in technological advances that it believes will help management drive operating leverage in the future through improved data analysis and automation. The Company also continues to evaluate core systems and will invest in enhancements that it believes will yield operating efficiencies.

The second financial objective is to increase net interest income through profitable loan and deposit growth and the optimization of the balance sheet. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company had an increase in net interest income of $31.3 million, or 14.9%, from the same period in 2022. The Company has shown increased net interest income through the effects of increased volume and favorable mix shift in average earning assets and the benefit of interest free funds. This increase is partially offset by higher deposit interest rates and borrowing costs. These changes are driven by the higher interest rate environment compared to the first quarter of 2022. The increase in interest income was driven by a $3.9 billion, or 22.5% increase in average loans, driven by organic loan growth, coupled with the impact of higher short-term and long-term interest rates. The funding for these assets was driven primarily by a 6.9% increase in average interest-bearing liabilities, including an increase in average borrowed funds of $928.6 million compared to the same period in 2022. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased 41 basis points compared to the same period in 2022, in large part due to repricing of earning assets and the benefit of interest free funds. These increases were partially offset by increased deposit and borrowing costs. Net interest spread contracted by 55 basis points during the same period. The Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets resulting from governmental responses to inflation and recessionary signs in the economy. These changing conditions could have impacts on the balance sheet and income statement of the Company for the remainder of the year. 

The third financial objective is to grow the Company&#8217;s revenue from noninterest sources. The Company seeks to grow noninterest revenues throughout all economic and interest rate cycles, while positioning itself to benefit in periods of economic growth. Noninterest income increased $6.5 million, or 5.3%, to $130.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. This change is primarily due to increases in brokerage and trust and securities processing income, offset by an impairment of an available-for-sale security and a decrease in service charges on deposits. See greater detail below under Noninterest Income. The Company continues to emphasize its asset management, brokerage, bankcard services, healthcare services, and treasury management businesses. At March 31, 2023, noninterest income represented 35.0% of total revenues, compared to 37.0% at March 31, 2022. The recent economic changes have impacted fee income, especially those with assets tied to market values and interest rates.

The fourth financial objective is effective capital management. The Company places a significant emphasis on maintaining a strong capital position, which management believes promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. The Company continues to maximize shareholder value through a mix of reinvesting in organic growth, evaluating acquisition opportunities that complement the Company&#8217;s strategies, increasing dividends over time, and appropriately utilizing a share repurchase program. At March 31, 2023, the Company had $2.8 billion in total shareholders&#8217; equity. This is an increase of $66.3 million, or 2.4%, compared to total 

&#160;

shareholders&#8217; equity at March 31, 2022. At March 31, 2023, the Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.49%. The Company repurchased 89,036 shares of common stock at an average price of $88.75 per share during the first quarter of 2023. 

Earnings Summary

The following is a summary regarding the Company&#8217;s earnings for the first quarter of 2023. The changes identified in the summary are explained in greater detail below. The Company recorded net income of $92.4 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, compared to net income of $106.0 million for the same period a year earlier. Basic earnings per share for the first quarter of 2023 was $1.91 per share ($1.90 per share fully-diluted) compared to basic earnings per share of $2.19 per share ($2.17 per share fully-diluted) for the first quarter of 2022. Return on average assets and return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023 were 0.97% and 13.76%, respectively, compared to 1.10% and 14.65%, respectively, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022. 

Net interest income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023 increased $31.3 million, or 14.9%, compared to the same period in 2022. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, average earning assets decreased by $1.0 billion, or 2.7%, compared to the same period in 2022. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased to 2.76% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, compared to 2.35% for the same period in 2022. 

The provision for credit losses increased by $29.8 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022. Provision expense for both periods is primarily impacted by macro-economic data and portfolio credit metrics. The Company&#8217;s nonperforming loans decreased $94.9 million to $15.5 million at March 31, 2023, compared to March 31, 2022. The ACL on loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to 0.97% as of March 31, 2023, compared to 1.01% at March 31, 2022. For a description of the Company&#8217;s methodology for computing the ACL, please see the summary discussion in the &#8220;Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; section included below.

Noninterest income increased by $6.5 million, or 5.3%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest Income.

Noninterest expense increased by $22.3 million, or 10.4%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest Expense.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is a significant source of the Company&#8217;s earnings and represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds the interest expense paid on liabilities. The volume of interest-earning assets and the related funding sources, the overall mix of these assets and liabilities, and the rates paid on each affect net interest income. Net interest income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023 increased $31.3 million, or 14.9%, compared to the same period in 2022. 

Table 1 shows the impact of earning asset rate changes compared to changes in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. As illustrated in this table, net interest spread for the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased 55 basis points as compared to the same period in 2022. Net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased 41 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. The changes are primarily due to favorable rate and volume variances on loans and an increased benefit of interest free funds, partially offset by unfavorable rate variances on interest-bearing liabilities and increased volume variance on other borrowed funds. These variances have led to an increase in the Company&#8217;s net interest income during 2023, as compared to results for the same period in 2022. The Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets and governmental responses to changes in the economy. These changing conditions could have impacts on the balance sheet and income statement of the Company the remainder of the year. For the impact of the contribution from free funds, see 

&#160;

the Analysis of Net Interest Margin within Table 2 below. Table 2 also illustrates how the changes in volume and interest rates have resulted in an increase in net interest income. 

Table 1

AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS/YIELDS AND RATES (tax-equivalent basis) (unaudited, dollars in thousands) 

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the average earning assets and resulting yields, as well as the average interest-bearing liabilities and resulting yields, expressed in both dollars and rates. All average balances are daily average balances. The average yield on earning assets without the tax-equivalent basis adjustment would have been 4.55% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, and 2.40% for the same period in 2022.

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses

The ACL represents management&#8217;s judgment of the total expected losses included in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The Company&#8217;s process for recording the ACL is based on the evaluation of the Company&#8217;s lifetime historical loss experience, management&#8217;s understanding of the credit quality inherent in the loan portfolio, and the impact of the current economic environment, coupled with reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.

&#160;

A mathematical calculation of an estimate is made to assist in determining the adequacy and reasonableness of management&#8217;s recorded ACL. To develop the estimate, the Company follows the guidelines in ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses . The estimate reserves for assets held at amortized cost and any related credit deterioration in the Company&#8217;s available-for-sale debt security portfolio. Assets held at amortized cost include the Company&#8217;s loan book and held-to-maturity security portfolio. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The process involves the consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the specific segmentation of loans. These factors have been established over decades of financial institution experience and include economic observation and loan loss characteristics. This process is designed to produce a lifetime estimate of the losses, at a reporting date, that includes evaluation of historical loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and the qualitative framework outlined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the published 2020 Interagency Policy Statement. This process allows management to take a holistic view of the recorded ACL reserve and ensure that all significant and pertinent information is considered.

&#160;

The Company considers a variety of factors to ensure the safety and soundness of its estimate including a strong internal control framework, extensive methodology documentation, credit underwriting standards which encompass the Company&#8217;s desired risk profile, model validation, and ratio analysis. If the Company&#8217;s total ACL estimate, as determined in accordance with the approved ACL methodology, is either outside a reasonable range based on review of economic indicators or by comparison of historical ratio analysis, the ACL estimate is an outlier and management will investigate the underlying reason(s). Based on that investigation, issues or factors that previously had not been considered may be identified in the estimation process, which may warrant adjustments to estimated credit losses. 

The ending result of this process is a recorded consolidated ACL that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of the total expected losses included in the loan portfolio, held-to-maturity securities, and credit deterioration in available-for-sale securities.

Based on the factors above, management of the Company recorded $23.3 million as provision for credit losses for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, compared to a reduction of $6.5 million for the same period in 2022. This change is the result of applying the methodology for computing the allowance for credit losses, coupled with the impacts of the current and forecasted economic environment. As illustrated in Table 3 below, the ACL on loans decreased to 0.97% of total loans as of March 31, 2023, compared to 1.01% of total loans as of March 31, 2022. 

Table 3 presents a summary of the Company&#8217;s ACL for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net charge-offs were $4.6 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, compared to $8.4 million for the same period in 2022. See &#8220;Credit Risk Management&#8221; under &#8220;Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; in this report for information relating to nonaccrual loans, past due loans, restructured loans and other credit risk matters.

Noninterest income increased by $6.5 million, or 5.3%, during the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. Table 4 above summarizes the components of noninterest income and the respective year-over-year comparison for each category.

Trust and securities processing income consists of fees earned on personal and corporate trust accounts, custody of securities services, trust investments and wealth management services, mutual fund assets, and alternative asset servicing. The increase in these fees for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, was primarily due to an increase in corporate trust and fund services revenues. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, corporate trust revenue increased $2.3 million, or 19.2% and fund services revenue increased $1.3 million, or 3.9%, offset by a decrease in trust services revenue of $0.7 million, or 5.1%. The recent volatile markets have impacted the income in this category. Since trust and securities processing fees are primarily asset-based, which are highly correlated to the change in market value of the assets, the related income for the remainder of the year will be affected by changes in the securities markets. Management continues to emphasize sales of services to both new and existing clients as well as increasing and improving the distribution channels.

Service charges on deposit accounts for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023 decreased by $3.5 million, or 14.1%, compared to the same period last year, driven by lower healthcare income related to customer termination fees received in the first quarter of 2022.

Brokerage fees for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023 increased $10.2 million, or 295.7%, compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was driven by higher 12b-1 and money market income. 

Bankcard fees for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023 increased $1.5 million, or 9.2%, compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was driven by higher interchange income, partially offset by higher rebate costs. 

Investment securities losses, net for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023 increased by $4.8 million, or 919.9%, compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was driven by the $4.8 million impairment of an available-for-sale subordinated debt security. The income in this category is highly correlated to the change in market value of the assets, and the related income for the remainder of the year will be affected by changes in the securities markets. The Company&#8217;s investment portfolio is continually evaluated for opportunities to improve its performance and risk profile relative to market conditions and the Company&#8217;s interest rate expectations. This can result in differences from quarter to quarter in the amount of realized gains or losses on this portfolio.

Noninterest expense increased by $22.3 million, or 10.4%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. Table 5 above summarizes the components of noninterest expense and the respective year-over-year comparison for each category. 

Salaries and employee benefits increased by $11.9 million, or 9.1%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. Salaries and wages expense increased $11.0 million, or 14.8%, employee benefits expense increased $4.7 million, or 17.2%, partially offset by a decrease in bonus and commission expense of $3.8 million, or 13.1%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. 

Processing fees increased $4.8 million, or 26.0%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to increased software subscription cost. 

Amortization of other intangible assets expense increased $1.2 million, or 114.6%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to the acquisition of the healthcare savings account business from Old National Bank, completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. 

Regulatory fees increased $2.1 million, or 59.4%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to increased deposit insurance costs.

Income Tax Expense

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate was 17.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to 15.7% for the same period in 2022. The effective tax rate increased primarily as a result of a decrease in excess tax benefits associated with stock compensation recorded in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period a year earlier. 

Strategic Lines of Business

&#160;

The Company has strategically aligned its operations into the following three reportable Business Segments: Commercial Banking, Institutional Banking, and Personal Banking. The Company&#8217;s senior executive officers regularly evaluate Business Segment financial results produced by the Company&#8217;s internal reporting system in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance for individual Business Segments. For comparability 

&#160;

purposes, amounts in all periods are based on methodologies in effect at March 31, 202 3 . Previously reported results have been reclassified in this Form 10-Q to conform to the Company&#8217;s current organizational structure.

For the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, Commercial Banking net income decreased $26.5 million to $57.1 million, as compared to the same period in 2022. Net interest income increased $6.0 million, or 4.2%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily driven by strong loan growth, earning asset mix changes and the increase in short-term interest rates. Provision for credit losses increased $28.1 million for the period, driven by loan growth, portfolio metric changes, and changes in macro-economic metrics in 2023 as compared to 2022 . Noninterest income decreased $3.8 million, or 14.2%, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to a decrease of $4.4 million in other income driven by reduced derivative income and the gain on sale of the Company&#8217;s factoring loan portfolio recorded in the first quarter of 2022. Noninterest expense increased $4.4 million, or 5.5%, to $84.0 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was driven by a $5.4 million increase in technology, service, and overhead expenses and an increase of $0.9 million in regulatory fees, and was partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million in other noninterest expense due to lower operational losses and loan expense in the first quarter of 2023.

Loans represent the Company&#8217;s largest source of interest income. In addition to growing the commercial loan portfolio, management believes its middle market commercial business and its consumer business, including home equity and credit card loan products, are the market niches that represent its best opportunity to cross-sell fee-related services and generate additional noninterest income for the Company.

Actual loan balances totaled $21.8 billion as of March 31, 2023, and increased $781.8 million, or 3.7%, compared to December 31, 2022, and increased $4.1 billion, or 23.0%, compared to March 31, 2022. Compared to December 31, 2022, commercial real estate loans increased $433.2 million, or 5.7%, and commercial and industrial loans increased $371.8 million, or 4.0%. Compared to March 31, 2022, commercial and industrial loans increased $2.0 billion, or 25.8%, commercial real estate loans increased $1.6 billion, or 25.4%, and consumer real estate loans increased $375.6 million, or 15.7%. See further information in Note 4, &#8220;Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Nonaccrual, past due and restructured loans are discussed under &#8220;Credit Risk Management&#8221; within &#8220;Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; in this report.

Investment Securities 

The Company&#8217;s investment portfolio contains trading, AFS, and HTM securities, as well as FRB stock, FHLB stock, and other miscellaneous investments. Investment securities totaled $13.2 billion as of both March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, and comprised 34.3% and 36.5% of the Company&#8217;s earning assets, respectively, as of those dates. 

The Company&#8217;s AFS securities portfolio comprised 52.3% of the Company&#8217;s investment securities portfolio at March 31, 2023 and 52.9% at December 31, 2022. The Company&#8217;s AFS securities portfolio provides liquidity as a result of the composition and average life of the underlying securities. This liquidity can be used to fund loan growth or to offset the outflow of traditional funding sources. The average life of the AFS securities portfolio was 59.8 months at March 31, 2023, compared to 62.3 months at December 31, 2022, and 74.1 months at March 31, 2022. In addition to providing a potential source of liquidity, the AFS securities portfolio can be used as a tool to manage interest rate sensitivity. The Company&#8217;s goal in the management of its AFS securities portfolio is to maximize return within the Company&#8217;s parameters of liquidity goals, interest rate risk, and credit risk.

Management expects collateral pledging requirements for public funds, loan demand, and deposit funding to be the primary factors impacting changes in the level of AFS securities. There were $10.1 billion and $10.3 billion of securities pledged to secure U.S. Government deposits, other public deposits, certain trust deposits, derivative transactions, and repurchase agreements at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

The Company&#8217;s HTM securities portfolio consists of U.S. agency-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, general obligation bonds, and private placement bonds. The HTM portfolio, net of the ACL, totaled $5.9 billion at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The average life of the HTM portfolio was 9.1 years at March 31, 2023, compared to 9.3 years at December 31, 2022, and 8.6 years at March 31, 2022.

The securities portfolio generates the Company&#8217;s second largest component of interest income. The securities portfolio achieved an average yield on a tax-equivalent basis of 2.61% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, compared to 2.21% for the same period in 2022.

At March 31, 2023, the unrealized pre-tax net loss on the AFS securities portfolio was $677.7 million, or 8.9% of the $7.6 billion amortized cost value, an improvement of $93.9 million as compared to December 31, 2022. At March 31, 2023, the unrealized pre-tax net loss on the securities designated as HTM was $489.8 million, or 8.4% of amortized cost value, compared to $580.9 million at December 31, 2022. During 2022, the Company transferred securities with an amortized cost balance of $4.1 billion and a fair value of $3.8 billion from the AFS category to the HTM category. The transfer of securities was made at fair value at the time of transfer. The remaining balance of unrealized pre-tax losses related to transferred securities was $237.1 million as of March 31, 2023, and $247.0 million as of December 31, 2022, and was included in the amortized cost balance of HTM securities. See further information in Note 5, &#8220;Securities&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

&#160;

At March 31, 2023, the total after-tax unrealized net losses on AFS and HTM securities portfolio represented 31.5% of common equity tier 1 capital. As of March 31, 2023, c ommon equity tier 1 capital totaled $3.2 billion and exclude d $626.8 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss . At March 31, 2023, an after-tax gain of $57.2 million was included in AOCI related to the C ompany&#8217;s fair value hedges of municipal securities. During 2021, the C ompany entered into ten of these hedge transactions, nine of which have since been terminated. The gain on the terminated hedges is being amortized over the remaining life of the underlying bonds. 

Deposits and Borrowed Funds

Deposits decreased $707.2 million, or 2.2%, from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023 and decreased $2.4 billion, or 7.1%, from March 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023. Total noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $771.6 million and total interest-bearing deposits increased $64.3 million from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023. Total noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $3.5 billion, and interest-bearing deposits increased $1.0 billion from March 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023. Deposits can fluctuate at quarter-end due to the operational nature of our commercial and institutional clients and typical seasonal declines in public funds deposits, particularly in the first quarter. The decrease in deposits and shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing is related to the recent increases in short-term and long-term interest rates as well as recent industry volatility. Noninterest-bearing deposits were 39.1%, 40.6%, and 46.4% of total deposits at March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022, respectively.

Deposits represent the Company&#8217;s primary funding source for its asset base. In addition to the core deposits garnered by the Company&#8217;s retail branch structure, the Company continues to focus on its cash management services, as well as its trust and mutual fund servicing businesses, in order to attract and retain additional deposits. Management believes a strong core deposit composition is one of the Company&#8217;s key strengths given its competitive product mix. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, 45% of customer deposits were from the Commercial operating segment. Within the Company&#8217;s commercial deposits, no one industry sector represented more than 5% of average deposits as of March 31, 2023. Additionally, approximately 55% of depositors have been with the Company for at least ten years.

As of March 31, 2023, there were an estimated $21.3 billion of uninsured deposits, a decrease of $3.4 billion as compared to December 31, 2022, and a decrease of $4.7 billion as compared to March 31, 2022. Estimated uninsured deposits comprised approximately 66.6%, 75.5%, and 75.6% of total deposits as of March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022, respectively. A portion of these uninsured deposits represent affiliate deposits and collateralized deposits. Affiliate deposits represent deposit accounts owned by the wholly owned subsidiaries of UMB Financial Corporation that are on deposit at UMB Bank, n.a. Collateralized deposits are public fund deposits or corporate trust deposits that are collateralized by high quality securities within the investment portfolio. Excluding affiliate deposits of $2.0 billion and collateralized deposits of $5.5 billion, the adjusted estimated uninsured deposits were $13.8 billion as of March 31, 2023. The adjusted ratio of estimated uninsured deposits, excluding affiliate and collateralized deposits, as a percentage of total deposits was approximately 43.1% as of March 31, 2023. The adjusted ratio of estimated uninsured deposits, excluding affiliate and collateralized deposits, as a percentage of total deposits was approximately 51.0% as of December 31, 2022, and 56.0% as of March 31, 2022. 

The Company participates in the IntraFi Cash Service program, which allows its customers to place deposits into the program to receive reciprocal FDIC insurance coverage. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had $811.2 million of deposits in the program.

Long-term debt totaled $381.8 million at March 31, 2023, compared to $381.3 million as of December 31, 2022, and $272.0 million as of March 31, 2022. In September 2022, the Company issued $110.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2032. The Company received $107.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 6.25% and an effective rate of 6.64%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2027. 

In September 2020, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2030. The Company received $197.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering 

&#160;

expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 3.70% and an effective rate of 3.93%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2025. 

The remainder of the Company&#8217;s long-term debt was assumed from the acquisition of Marquette and consists of debt obligations payable to four unconsolidated trusts (Marquette Capital Trust I, Marquette Capital Trust II, Marquette Capital Trust III, and Marquette Capital Trust IV) that previously issued trust preferred securities. These long-term debt obligations have an aggregate contractual balance of $103.1 million. Interest rates on trust preferred securities are tied to the three-month LIBOR rate with spreads ranging from 133 basis points to 160 basis points, and reset quarterly. The trust preferred securities have maturity dates ranging from January 2036 to September 2036.

The Company has a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. which allows the Company to borrow up to $30.0 million for general working capital purposes. The interest rate applied to borrowed balances will be at the Company&#8217;s option either 1.4% above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or 1.75% below the prime rate on the date of an advance. The Company pays a 0.4% unused commitment fee for unused portions of the revolving line of credit. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had no advances outstanding on this revolving line of credit. 

Short-term debt totaled $2.8 billion as March 31, 2023 and consists of a $1.8 billion short-term borrowing with the FHLB of Des Moines and a $1.0 billion borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Both borrowings mature during the second quarter of 2023 and have interest rates of 5.0%. The level of borrowings could be impacted by earning asset mix changes in the Company&#8217;s balance sheet from the impacts of recent industry volatility.

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled $2.2 billion as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and $2.8 billion at March 31, 2022. Repurchase agreements are transactions involving the exchange of investment funds by the customer for securities by the Company under an agreement to repurchase the same or similar issues at an agreed-upon price and date. The level of borrowings could be impacted by earning asset mix changes in the Company&#8217;s balance sheet from the impacts of recent industry volatility.

Capital and Liquidity

The Company places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of a strong capital position, which promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. Higher levels of liquidity, however, bear corresponding costs, measured in terms of lower yields on short-term, more liquid earning assets and higher expenses for extended liability maturities. The Company manages capital for each subsidiary based upon the subsidiary&#8217;s respective risks and growth opportunities as well as regulatory requirements.

Total shareholders&#8217; equity was $2.8 billion at March 31, 2023, a $147.6 million increase compared to December 31, 2022, and a $66.3 million increase compared to March 31, 2022. Total accumulated other comprehensive loss was $626.8 million at March 31, 2023. This is an improvement of $76.0 million as compared to December 31, 2022, and a decline of $283.6 million as compared to March 31, 2022.

The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized, at its April 26, 2022 and April 27, 2021 meetings, the repurchase of up to two million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock during the twelve months following each meeting (each a Repurchase Authorization). During the three-month periods ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company acquired 89,036 shares and 226,706 shares, respectively, of its common stock pursuant to the applicable Repurchase Authorization. 

At the Company&#8217;s quarterly board meeting, the Board of Directors declared a $0.38 per share quarterly cash dividend payable on July 3, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 12, 2023.

&#160;

Through the Company&#8217;s relationship with the FHLB of Des Moines, the Company owns $ 82.2 million of FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding sources through FHLB advances. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the Company places at the FHLB. The Company had a $1.8 billion short-term advance outstanding at FHLB of Des Moines as of March 31, 2023. Additionally, i n March 2023, the FHLB of Des Moines issued a letter of credit for $150.0 million on behalf of the Company to secure deposits. This letter of credit will expire in June 2023 . T he Company&#8217;s remaining borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $ 866.2 million as of March 31, 202 3 . 

The Company had a $1.0 billion short-term borrowing outstanding at the Federal Reserve Discount Window as of March 31, 2023. The Company&#8217;s remaining borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Discount Window was $7.4 billion as of March 31, 2023.

In addition to borrowing capacity with the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Discount Window as described above, the Company had additional liquidity of $5.1 billion available via cash, unpledged bond collateral, and the IntraFi Cash Service program.

Risk-based capital guidelines established by regulatory agencies set minimum capital standards based on the level of risk associated with a financial institution&#8217;s assets. The Company has implemented the Basel III regulatory capital rules adopted by the FRB. Basel III capital rules include a minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%. A financial institution&#8217;s total capital is also required to equal at least 8% of risk-weighted assets. 

The risk-based capital guidelines indicate the specific risk weightings by type of asset. Certain off-balance sheet items (such as standby letters of credit and binding loan commitments) are multiplied by credit conversion factors to translate them into balance sheet equivalents before assigning them specific risk weightings. The Company is also required to maintain a leverage ratio equal to or greater than 4%. The leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of tier 1 core capital to total average assets, less goodwill and intangibles. 

&#160;

U.S. banking agencies in December 2018 approved a final rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing banking organizations the option to phase in the day-one impact of CECL until the first quarter of 2023. In March 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The Company elected this alternative option instead of the one described in the December 2018 rule.

The Company's capital position as of March 31, 2023 is summarized in the table below and exceeded regulatory requirements.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company&#8217;s main off-balance sheet arrangements are loan commitments, commercial and standby letters of credit, futures contracts and forward exchange contracts, which have maturity dates rather than payment due dates. See Note 10, &#8220;Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on these arrangements. The level of the outstanding commitments could be impacted by volatility in the economic markets and governmental responses to inflation, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain constraints. These changing conditions could have impacts on the consolidated balance sheets of the Company for the remainder of the year.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to customers and suppliers, allowance for credit losses, bad debts, investments, financing operations, long-lived assets, taxes, other contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Under different assumptions or conditions, actual results may differ from the recorded estimates. 

A summary of critical accounting policies is listed in the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; section of the Form 10-K.
