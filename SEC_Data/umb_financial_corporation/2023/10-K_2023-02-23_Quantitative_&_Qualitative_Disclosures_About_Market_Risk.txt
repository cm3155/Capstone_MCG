 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Risk Management

Market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument. These changes may be the result of various factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange prices, commodity prices, or equity prices. Financial instruments that are subject to market risk can be classified either as held for trading or held for purposes other than trading.

&#160;

The Company is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates of its assets held for purposes other than trading. The following discussion of interest rate risk, however, combines instruments held for trading and instruments held for purposes other than trading because the instruments held for trading represent such a small portion of the Company&#8217;s portfolio that the interest rate risk associated with them is immaterial. 

Interest Rate Risk

In the banking industry, a major risk exposure is changing interest rates. To minimize the effect of interest rate changes to net interest income and exposure levels to economic losses, the Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management within guidelines established by its Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) and approved by the Board. The ALCO is responsible for approving and ensuring compliance with asset/liability management policies, including interest rate exposure. The Company&#8217;s primary method for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate risk is the Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis. The Company also uses a Net Portfolio Value model to measure market value risk under various rate change scenarios and a gap analysis to measure maturity and repricing relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at specific points in time. On a limited basis, the Company uses hedges such as swaps, rate floors, and futures contracts to manage interest rate risk on certain loans, trading securities, trust preferred securities, and deposits. See further information in Note 17 &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging Activities&#8221; in the Notes to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Overall, the Company attempts to manage interest rate risk by positioning the balance sheet to maximize net interest income while maintaining an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, remaining mindful of the relationship among profitability, liquidity, interest rate risk and credit risk. 

Net Interest Income Modeling

The Company&#8217;s primary interest rate risk tool, the Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis, measures interest rate risk and the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and net interest margin. This analysis incorporates all of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities together with assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment. Through these simulations, management estimates the impact on net interest income of a 300-basis-point upward or a 100-basis-point downward gradual change (e.g. ramp) and immediate change (e.g. shock) of market interest rates over a two-year period. In ramp scenarios, rates change gradually for a one-year period and remain constant in year two. In shock scenarios, rates change immediately and the change is sustained for the remainder of the two year scenario horizon. Assumptions are made to project rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis, management outlook and repricing strategies. Asset prepayments and other market risks are developed from industry estimates of prepayment speeds and other market changes. The results of these simulations can be significantly influenced by assumptions utilized and management evaluates the sensitivity of the simulation results on a regular basis. 

Table 18 shows the net interest income percentage increase or decrease over the next twelve- and twenty-four-month periods as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 based on hypothetical changes in interest rates and a constant sized balance sheet with runoff being replaced.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

The Company is positioned relatively neutral to changes in interest rates in the next year. Net interest income is predicted to increase in all upward rate shock scenarios and decrease in all upward rate ramp scenarios. In down rate scenarios, net interest income is predicted to decrease in shock scenarios and increase in ramp scenarios. The largest change in net interest income relative to base in either rate shock or ramp scenarios is less than 5% in year one. In year two, net interest income is predicted to rise in all increasing rate scenarios and decrease in falling rate scenarios. The Company&#8217;s ability to price deposits consistent with its history is a key assumption in these scenarios. 

Repricing Mismatch Analysis

The Company also evaluates its interest rate sensitivity position in an attempt to maintain a balance between the amount of interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities which are expected to mature or reprice at any point in time. While a traditional repricing mismatch analysis (gap analysis) provides a snapshot of interest rate risk, it does not take into consideration that assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics may not, in fact, reprice at the same time or the same degree. Also, it does not necessarily predict the impact of changes in general levels of interest rates on net interest income.

&#160;

Table 19 is a static gap analysis, which presents the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities, based on their repricing or maturity characteristics and reflecting principal amortization. Table 2 0 presents the break-out of fixed and variable rate loans by repricing or maturity characteristics for each loan class.

Trading Account

The Bank carries taxable governmental securities in a trading account that is maintained in accordance with Board-approved policy and procedures. The policy limits the amount and type of securities that can be carried in the trading account and requires compliance with any limits under applicable law and regulations and mandates the use of a value-at-risk methodology to manage price volatility risks within financial parameters. The risk associated with the carrying of trading securities is offset by the sale of exchange-traded financial futures contracts, with both the trading account and futures contracts marked to market daily. This account had a balance of $18.0 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to $31.9 million as of December 31, 2021.

The Company is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates of its assets held for purposes other than trading. The discussion in Table 19 above of interest rate risk, however, combines instruments held for trading and instruments held for purposes other than trading, because the instruments held for trading represent such a small portion of the Company&#8217;s portfolio that the interest rate risk associated with them is immaterial.

Other Market Risk

The Company has minimal foreign currency risk as a result of foreign exchange contracts. See Note 10, &#8220;Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Credit Risk Management

Credit risk represents the risk that a customer or counterparty may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. The Company utilizes a centralized credit administration function, which provides information on the Bank&#8217;s risk levels, delinquencies, an internal risk grading system and overall credit exposure. Loan requests are centrally 

&#160;

reviewed to ensure the consistent application of the loan policy and standards. In addition, the Company has an internal loan review staff that operates independently of the Bank. This review team performs periodic examinations of the B ank&#8217;s loans for credit quality, documentation and loan administration. The respective regulatory authority of the Bank also reviews loan portfolios. 

A primary indicator of credit quality and risk management is the level of nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans include both nonaccrual loans and restructured loans on nonaccrual. The Company&#8217;s nonperforming loans decreased $73.0 million to $19.3 million at December 31, 2022, compared to December 31, 2021. There was an immaterial amount of interest recognized on nonperforming loans during 2022, 2021, and 2020.

The Company had $68 thousand of other real estate owned as of December 31, 2022. Loans past due more than 90 days and still accruing interest totaled $1.6 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to $2.6 million as of December 31, 2021.

A loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when payments are past due 90 days or more and/or when management has considerable doubt about the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay on the terms originally contracted. The accrual of interest is discontinued and recorded thereafter only when actually received in cash.

Certain loans are restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal due to deterioration in the financial condition of the respective borrowers. The Company had $5.2 million of restructured loans at December 31, 2022 and $7.3 million at December 31, 2021.

Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $39.9 million, compared to $44.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity represents the Company&#8217;s ability to meet financial commitments through the maturity and sale of existing assets or availability of additional funds. The Company believes that the most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of a large, stable supply of core deposits and wholesale funds. Ultimately, the Company believes public confidence is generated through profitable operations, sound credit quality and a strong capital position. The primary source of liquidity for the Company is regularly scheduled payments on and maturity of assets, which include $7.0 billion of high-quality securities available for sale. The liquidity of the Company and the Bank is also enhanced by its activity in the federal funds market and by its core deposits. Additionally, management believes it can raise debt or equity capital on favorable terms in the future, should the need arise.

Another factor affecting liquidity is the amount of deposits and customer repurchase agreements that have pledging requirements. All customer repurchase agreements require collateral in the form of a security. The U.S. Government, other public entities, and certain trust depositors require the Company to pledge securities if their deposit balances are greater than the FDIC-insured deposit limitations. These pledging requirements affect liquidity risk in that the related security cannot otherwise be disposed due to the pledging restriction. At December 31, 2022, $10.3 billion, or 80.3%, of securities were pledged or used as collateral, compared to $10.2 billion, or 75.8%, at December 31, 2021. Of these amounts, securities with a market value of $171.2 million at December 31, 2021, were pledged at the Federal Reserve Discount Window but were unencumbered as of that date.

The Company also has other commercial commitments that may impact liquidity. These commitments include unused commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit. The total amount of these commercial commitments at December 31, 2022 was $17.4 billion. Since many of these commitments expire without being drawn upon, the total amount of these commercial commitments does not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the Company. 

The Company&#8217;s cash requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, operating expenses, and treasury stock purchases. Management fees and dividends received from bank and non-bank subsidiaries traditionally have been sufficient to satisfy these requirements and are expected to be sufficient in the future. The Bank is subject to various rules regarding payment of dividends to the Company. For the most part, the Bank can pay dividends at least equal to its current year&#8217;s earnings without seeking prior regulatory approval. The Company also uses cash to inject capital into the Bank and its non-Bank subsidiaries to maintain adequate capital as well as to fund strategic initiatives. 

&#160;

In September 2022, the Company issued $110.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2032. The Company received $107.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 6.25% and an effective rate of 6.64%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2027. 

In September 2020, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2030. The Company received $197.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 3.70% and an effective rate of 3.93%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2025. 

To enhance general working capital needs, the Company has a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. which allows the Company to borrow up to $30.0 million for general working capital purposes. The interest rate applied to borrowed balances will be at the Company&#8217;s option, either 1.4% above SOFR or 1.75% below the prime rate on the date of an advance. The Company pays a 0.4% unused commitment fee for unused portions of the line of credit. The Company had no advances outstanding at December 31, 2022.

The Company is a member bank of the FHLB. The Company owns $10.0 million of FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding sources through FHLB advances. The Company has access to borrow up to $1.9 billion through advances at the FHLB of Des Moines but had no outstanding FHLB Des Moines advances as of December 31, 2022. 

Operational Risk

Operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the Company&#8217;s operations, including those operations performed for the Company by third parties. This would include but is not limited to the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees or others, errors relating to transaction processing, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and unplanned interruptions in service. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency, or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards.

The Company operates in many markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to properly process a high number of transactions. In the event of a breakdown in internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, the Company could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation. In order to address this risk, management maintains a system of internal controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data.

The Company maintains systems of internal controls that provide management with timely and accurate information about the Company&#8217;s operations. These systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate levels given the Company&#8217;s financial strength, the environment in which it operates, and considering factors such as competition and regulation. The Company has also established procedures that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics and business practices are followed on a uniform basis. In certain cases, the Company has experienced losses from operational risk. Such losses have included the effects of operational errors that the Company has discovered and included as expense in the statement of income. While there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer such losses in the future, management continually monitors and works to improve its internal controls, systems and corporate-wide processes and procedures.
