Overview 

The rapid rise in interest rates during 2022 and in the first nine months of 2023, the resulting industry-wide reduction in the fair value of securities portfolios, and the recent bank runs that led to the failures of some financial institutions in March of 2023, among other events, have resulted in a current state of volatility and uncertainty with respect to the health of the U.S. banking system. There is heightened awareness around liquidity, uninsured deposits, 

&#160; 

&#160; 

deposit composition, unrecognized investment losses, and capital. See further discussion around these items in the remaining sections of the Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

&#160; 

The Company focuses on the following four core financial objectives. Management believes these objectives will guide its efforts to achieve its vision, to deliver the Unparalleled Customer Experience, all while seeking to improve net income and strengthen the balance sheet while undertaking prudent risk management. 

&#160; 

The first financial objective is to continuously improve operating efficiencies. The Company has focused on identifying efficiencies that simplify our organizational and reporting structures, streamline back-office functions, and take advantage of synergies and newer technologies among various platforms and distribution networks. The Company has identified and expects to continue identifying ongoing efficiencies through the normal course of business that, when combined with increased revenue, will contribute to improved operating leverage. During the third quarter of 2023, total revenue decreased $6.6 million, or 1.8%, as compared to the third quarter of 2022, while noninterest expense was flat for the same period. As part of the initiative to improve operating efficiencies, the Company continues to invest in technological advances that it believes will help management drive operating leverage in the future through improved data analysis and automation. The Company also continues to evaluate core systems and will invest in enhancements that it believes will yield operating efficiencies. 

&#160; 

The second financial objective is to increase net interest income through profitable loan and deposit growth and the optimization of the balance sheet. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company had a decrease in net interest income of $11.2 million, or 4.8%, from the same period in 2022. The change in net interest income was driven by higher interest expense due to an unfavorable mix shift in the composition of liabilities, partially offset by increased loan growth. These changes are driven by the higher interest rate environment compared to the third quarter of 2022. The increase in interest income was driven by a $3.5 billion, or 18.0% increase in average loans, driven by organic loan growth, coupled with the impact of higher short-term and long-term interest rates. The funding for these assets was driven primarily by a 25.0% increase in average interest-bearing liabilities, including an increase in average borrowed funds of $2.3 billion compared to the same period in 2022. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased 33 basis points compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to increased cost and mix of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by increased loan volumes, repricing of earning assets, and the benefit of interest free funds. Net interest spread contracted by 99 basis points during the same period. The Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets resulting from governmental responses to inflation and recessionary signs in the economy. These changing conditions could have impacts on the balance sheet and income statement of the Company for the remainder of the year. 

&#160; 

The third financial objective is to grow the Company&#8217;s revenue from noninterest sources. The Company seeks to grow noninterest revenues throughout all economic and interest rate cycles, while positioning itself to benefit in periods of economic growth. Noninterest income increased $4.6 million, or 3.6%, to $133.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. See greater detail below under Noninterest Income. The Company continues to emphasize its asset management, brokerage, bankcard services, healthcare services, and treasury management businesses. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, noninterest income represented 37.5% of total revenue, compared to 35.5% for the same period in 2022. The recent economic changes have impacted fee income, especially those with assets tied to market values and interest rates. 

&#160; 

The fourth financial objective is effective capital management. The Company places a significant emphasis on maintaining a strong capital position, which management believes promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. The Company continues to maximize shareholder value through a mix of reinvesting in organic growth, evaluating acquisition opportunities that complement the Company&#8217;s strategies, increasing dividends over time, and appropriately utilizing a share repurchase program. At September 30, 2023, the Company had $2.8 billion in total shareholders&#8217; equity. This is an increase of $283.1 million, or 11.2%, compared to total shareholders&#8217; equity at September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2023, the Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.68%. The Company did not repurchase shares of common stock during the third quarter of 2023. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Earnings Summary 

The following is a summary regarding the Company&#8217;s earnings for the third quarter of 2023. The changes identified in the summary are explained in greater detail below. The Company recorded net income of $96.6 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, compared to net income of $88.0 million for the same period a year earlier. Basic earnings per share for the third quarter of 2023 were $1.99 per share ($1.98 per share fully-diluted) compared to $1.82 per share ($1.81 per share fully-diluted) for the third quarter of 2022. Return on average assets and return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 were 0.97% and 13.25%, respectively, compared to 0.96% and 12.90%, respectively, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2022. 

The Company recorded net income of $279.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, compared to net income of $331.5 million for the same period a year earlier. Basic earnings per share for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 were $5.76 per share ($5.73 per share fully-diluted) compared to $6.86 per share ($6.80 per share fully-diluted) for the same period in 2022. Return on average assets and return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 were 0.95% and 13.18%, respectively, compared to 1.18% and 16.05%, respectively, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022. 

Net interest income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 decreased $11.2 million, or 4.8%, and increased $21.0 million, or 3.1%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, average earning assets increased by $2.9 billion, or 8.5%, and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, they increased by $1.5 billion, or 4.2%, compared to the same periods in 2022. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 2.43% and to 2.54% for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to 2.76% and 2.56% for the same periods in 2022. 

The provision for credit losses decreased by $17.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 and increased by $12.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods in 2022. These changes were driven by loan growth, portfolio credit metric changes, and changes in macro-economic metrics in the current period as compared to the prior periods. The Company&#8217;s nonperforming loans decreased $2.8 million to $17.0 million at September 30, 2023, compared to September 30, 2022. The ACL on loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 0.97% as of September 30, 2023, compared to 0.93% at September 30, 2022. For a description of the Company&#8217;s methodology for computing the ACL, please see the summary discussion in the &#8220;Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; section included below. 

Noninterest income increased by $4.6 million, or 3.6%, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, and decreased by $27.1 million, or 6.3%, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same periods in 2022. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest Income. 

Noninterest expense was flat for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, and increased by $48.9 million, or 7.4%, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same periods in 2022. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest Expense. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is a significant source of the Company&#8217;s earnings and represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds the interest expense paid on liabilities. The volume of interest-earning assets and the related funding sources, the overall mix of these assets and liabilities, and the rates paid on each affect net interest income. Net interest income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 decreased $11.2 million, or 4.8%, and increased $21.0 million, or 3.1%, compared to the same periods in 2022. 

Table 1 shows the impact of earning asset rate changes compared to changes in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. As illustrated in this table, net interest spread for the three months ended September 30, 2023 decreased 99 basis points as compared to the same period in 2022. Net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2023 decreased 33 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. Net interest spread for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 decreased by 88 basis points as compared to the same period in 2022. Net interest margin for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 decreased by two basis points compared to the 

&#160; 

&#160; 

same period in 2022. The changes are primarily due to increased cost and mix of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by increased loan volumes, repricing of earning assets, and the benefit of interest free funds. The impact of the increased cost and mix of interest-bearing liabilities had a significant impact in the third quarter of 2023. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 254 basis points from the third quarter of 2023 and 281 basis points for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Earning asset balance increases have been primarily driven by higher average loan balances. The Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets and governmental responses to changes in the economy. These changing conditions could have impacts on the balance sheet and income statement of the Company the remainder of the year. For the impact of the contribution from free funds, see the Analysis of Net Interest Margin within Table 2 below. Table 2 also illustrates how the changes in volume and interest rates have resulted in an increase in net interest income. 

Table 1 

AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS/YIELDS AND RATES (tax-equivalent basis) (unaudited, dollars in thousands) 

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the average earning assets and resulting yields, as well as the average interest-bearing liabilities and resulting yields, expressed in both dollars and rates. All average balances are daily average balances. The average yield on earning assets without the tax-equivalent basis adjustment would have been 5.01% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, and 3.46% for the same period in 2022. The average yield on earning assets without the tax-equivalent basis adjustment would have been 4.80% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, and 2.87% for the same period in 2022.

Table 2 presents the dollar amount of change in net interest income and margin due to volume and rate. Table 2 also reflects the effect that interest-free funds have on net interest margin. The average balance of interest-free funds (total earning assets less interest-bearing liabilities) decreased $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The benefit from interest-free funds increased 66 and 86 basis points in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022, primarily due to increased short-term interest rates.

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL represents management&#8217;s judgment of the total expected losses included in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The Company&#8217;s process for recording the ACL is based on the evaluation of the Company&#8217;s lifetime historical loss experience, management&#8217;s understanding of the credit quality inherent in the loan portfolio, and the impact of the current economic environment, coupled with reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. 

A mathematical calculation of an estimate is made to assist in determining the adequacy and reasonableness of management&#8217;s recorded ACL. To develop the estimate, the Company follows the guidelines in ASC Topic 326, 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses . The estimate reserves for assets held at amortized cost and any related credit deterioration in the Company&#8217;s available-for-sale debt security portfolio. Assets held at amortized cost include the Company&#8217;s loan book and held-to-maturity security portfolio. 

The process involves the consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the specific segmentation of loans. These factors have been established over decades of financial institution experience and include economic observation and loan loss characteristics. This process is designed to produce a lifetime estimate of the losses, at a reporting date, that includes evaluation of historical loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and the qualitative framework outlined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the published 2020 Interagency Policy Statement. This process allows management to take a holistic view of the recorded ACL reserve and ensure that all significant and pertinent information is considered. 

The Company considers a variety of factors to ensure the safety and soundness of its estimate including a strong internal control framework, extensive methodology documentation, credit underwriting standards which encompass the Company&#8217;s desired risk profile, model validation, and ratio analysis. If the Company&#8217;s total ACL estimate, as determined in accordance with the approved ACL methodology, is either outside a reasonable range based on review of economic indicators or by comparison of historical ratio analysis, the ACL estimate is an outlier and management will investigate the underlying reason(s). Based on that investigation, issues or factors that previously had not been considered may be identified in the estimation process, which may warrant adjustments to estimated credit losses. 

The ending result of this process is a recorded consolidated ACL that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of the total expected losses included in the loan portfolio, held-to-maturity securities, and credit deterioration in available-for-sale securities. 

Based on the factors above, management of the Company recorded $5.0 million as provision for credit losses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $22.0 million for the same period in 2022. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, management of the Company recorded $41.2 million as provision for credit losses, as compared to $28.9 million for the same period in 2022. These changes are the result of applying the methodology for computing the ACL, coupled with the impacts of the current and forecasted economic environment. As illustrated in Table 3 below, the ACL on loans increased to 0.97% of total loans as of September 30, 2023, compared to 0.93% of total loans as of September 30, 2022. 

Table 3 presents a summary of the Company&#8217;s ACL for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net charge-offs were $9.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, compared to $37.7 million for the same period in 2022. See &#8220;Credit Risk Management&#8221; under &#8220;Item 3.

Noninterest income increased by $4.6 million, or 3.6%, during the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, and decreased $27.1 million, or 6.3%, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same periods in 2022. Table 4 above summarizes the components of noninterest income and the respective year-over-year comparison for each category. 

Trust and securities processing income consists of fees earned on personal and corporate trust accounts, custody of securities services, trust investments and wealth management services, mutual fund assets, and alternative asset servicing. The increase in these fees for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same periods in 2022, was primarily due to an increase in fund services and corporate trust revenues. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, fund services revenue increased $4.1 million, or 12.2%, and corporate trust revenue increased $2.4 million, or 19.6%, compared to the same period in 2022. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, corporate trust revenue increased $5.8 million, or 16.0%, and fund services revenue increased $7.3 million, or 7.3%, compared to the same period in 2022. The recent volatile markets have impacted the income in this category. Since trust and securities processing fees are primarily asset-based, which are highly correlated to the change in market value of the assets, the related income for the remainder of the year will be affected by changes in the securities markets. Management continues to emphasize sales of services to both new and existing clients as well as increasing and improving the distribution channels. 

Trading and investment banking fees for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 decreased $1.6 million, or 30.0%, and decreased $4.1 million, or 22.7%, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. These changes were primarily driven by the volatile market&#8217;s impact on trading volume. The income in this category is market driven and impacted by general increases or decreases in trading volume. 

Service charges on deposit accounts for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 increased $1.1 million, or 5.8%, and decreased $1.8 million, or 2.7%, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The 

&#160; 

&#160; 

increase for the three-month period was driven by increased corporate service charge income. The decrease for the nine-month period was driven by lower healthcare income. 

Brokerage fees for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 decreased $0.4 million, or 3.2%, compared to the same period in 2022. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, brokerage fees increased $11.0 million, or 37.0%, compared to the same period in 2022. The changes in the three-month and nine-month periods were driven by 12b-1 fees and money market income. 

Bankcard fees for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 were flat and increased $2.2 million, or 4.1%, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2022. The increase was driven by increased interchange income, partially offset by higher rewards and rebate costs. 

Investment securities gains, net for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 increased $1.6 million, or 120.1%, and decreased $63.0 million, or 107.1%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The increase for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, was driven by an increase in the value of the Company's marketable securities as compared to the same periods in 2022. The decrease for the nine-month period was driven by a $66.2 million gain realized on the sale of the Company&#8217;s Visa Inc. Class B common shares in the second quarter of 2022. This decrease was coupled with an impairment loss on an available-for-sale subordinated debt security recorded in 2023, and partially offset by an increase in the value of the Company's marketable securities as compared to the same period in 2022. The income in this category is highly correlated to the change in market value of the assets, and the related income for the remainder of the year will be affected by changes in the securities markets. The Company&#8217;s investment portfolio is continually evaluated for opportunities to improve its performance and risk profile relative to market conditions and the Company&#8217;s interest rate expectations. This can result in differences from quarter to quarter in the amount of realized gains or losses on this portfolio. 

Other noninterest income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, decreased $3.0 million, or 26.0%, compared to the same period in 2022, driven by decreases of $2.7 million in company-owned life insurance and $1.3 million in derivative income. For the nine-month period, other noninterest income increased $16.0 million, or 66.5%, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily driven by a $15.2 million increase in company-owned life insurance and an increase of $1.2 million in bank-owned life insurance.

Noninterest expense was flat and increased $48.9 million, or 7.4%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. Table 5 above summarizes the components of noninterest expense and the respective year-over-year comparison for each category. 

Salaries and employee benefits decreased by $3.1 million, or 2.3%, and increased $30.7 million, or 7.9%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. Salaries and wages expense increased $3.0 million, or 3.7%, and increased $23.1 million, or 10.0%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. Bonus and commission expense decreased $4.6 million, or 13.8%, and decreased $10.2 million, or 10.6%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. Employee benefits expense decreased $1.5 million, or 6.8%, and increased $17.8 million, or 29.7%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022, driven by changes in deferred compensation expense. 

Equipment expense decreased $1.6 million, or 8.5%, and $3.2 million, or 5.7%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022, primarily due to decreased software expense. 

Marketing and business development expense was flat, and increased $2.2 million, or 12.9%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The increase in the nine-month period was primarily due to the timing of multiple marketing initiatives, as well as increased travel and entertainment expense. 

Processing fees increased $5.1 million, or 24.5%, and $17.1 million, or 29.2%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022, primarily due to increased software subscription costs. 

Legal and consulting expense decreased $3.0 million, or 29.5%, and $6.9 million, or 24.1%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022, primarily due to the timing of multiple projects. 

Bankcard expense increased $2.3 million, or 35.1%, and $5.3 million, or 27.9%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022 primarily driven by higher administrative expense. 

Regulatory fees increased $2.0 million, or 46.5%, and $6.7 million, or 59.9%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022 primarily driven by higher deposit insurance expense. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Other expense decreased $2.7 million, or 24.6%, and $7.4 million, or 22.8%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. For the three-month period the decrease was driven by lower operational losses. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, this decrease was due to lower charitable contribution expense. 

Income Tax Expense 

The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate was 18.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 18.8% for the same period in 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2023 is primarily attributable to a larger portion of income being earned from tax-exempt municipal securities. 

Strategic Lines of Business 

The Company has strategically aligned its operations into the following three reportable Business Segments: Commercial Banking, Institutional Banking, and Personal Banking. The Company&#8217;s senior executive officers regularly evaluate Business Segment financial results produced by the Company&#8217;s internal reporting system in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance for individual Business Segments. For comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on methodologies in effect at September 30, 2023. Previously reported results have been reclassified in this Form 10-Q to conform to the Company&#8217;s current organizational structure.

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, Commercial Banking net income decreased $33.3 million, or 15.1%, to $187.9 million, as compared to the same period in 2022. Net interest income was flat for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, driven by increased interest expense due to the unfavorable changes in the mix of interest-bearing liabilities and higher interest rates, but offset by strong loan growth and increased loan yields. Provision for credit losses increased $9.9 million for the period, driven by loan growth, portfolio metric changes, and changes in macro-economic metrics in 2023 as compared to 2022. Noninterest income decreased $28.7 million, or 28.6%, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to an allocated portion of the gain on the sale of Visa Inc. Class B common shares recorded in the second quarter of 2022, as well as a decrease of $5.3 million in other income due to reduced derivative income and the gain on sale of 

&#160; 

&#160; 

the Company&#8217;s factoring loan portfolio recorded in the first quarter of 2022. Noninterest expense increased $5.4 million, or 2.2%, to $251.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was driven by a $3.9 million increase in salary and benefits expense, a $3.0 million increase in regulatory fees, a $1.7 million increase in processing fees, and a $1.7 million increase in technology, service, and overhead expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $4.5 million in legal and consulting expense.

Net interest income increased $44.0 million, or 42.1%, compared to the same period last year, driven by an increase in funds transfer pricing due to the increase in interest rates. Noninterest income increased $13.8 million, or 5.7%, primarily due to increases of $13.3 million in trust and securities processing and $11.1 million in brokerage fees, partially offset by a decrease in income related to the allocated portion of the gain on the sale of Visa Inc. Class B common shares recorded in the second quarter of 2022.

Loans represent the Company&#8217;s largest source of interest income. In addition to growing the commercial loan portfolio, management believes its middle market commercial business and its consumer business, including home equity and credit card loan products, are the market niches that represent its best opportunity to cross-sell fee-related services and generate additional noninterest income for the Company. 

Actual loan balances totaled $22.9 billion as of September 30, 2023, and increased $1.9 billion, or 8.8%, compared to December 31, 2022, and increased $3.0 billion, or 15.1%, compared to September 30, 2022. Compared to December 31, 2022, commercial real estate loans increased $1.2 billion, or 15.3%, commercial and industrial loans increased $583.7 million, or 6.3%, and consumer real estate loans increased $201.2 million, or 7.4%. Compared to September 30, 2022, commercial real estate loans increased $1.7 billion, or 23.6%, commercial and industrial loans increased $1.0 billion, or 11.4%, and consumer real estate loans increased $290.0 million, or 11.0%. See further information in Note 4, &#8220;Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Nonaccrual, past due and restructured loans are discussed under &#8220;Credit Risk Management&#8221; within &#8220;Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; in this report.

The Company&#8217;s AFS securities portfolio comprised 50.4% of the Company&#8217;s total securities portfolio at September 30, 2023 and 52.9% at December 31, 2022. The Company&#8217;s AFS securities portfolio provides liquidity as a result of the composition and average life of the underlying securities. This liquidity can be used to fund loan growth or to offset the outflow of traditional funding sources. The average life of the AFS securities portfolio was 61.7 months at September 30, 2023, compared to 62.3 months at December 31, 2022, and 69.7 months at September 30, 2022. In addition to providing a potential source of liquidity, the AFS securities portfolio can be used as a tool to manage interest rate sensitivity. The Company&#8217;s goal in the management of its AFS securities portfolio is to maximize return within the Company&#8217;s parameters of liquidity goals, interest rate risk, and credit risk. 

Management expects collateral pledging requirements for public funds, loan demand, and deposit funding to be the primary factors impacting changes in the level of AFS securities. There were $8.5 billion and $10.3 billion of securities pledged to secure U.S. Government deposits, other public deposits, certain trust deposits, derivative transactions, and repurchase agreements at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

The Company&#8217;s HTM securities portfolio consists of U.S. agency-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, general obligation bonds, and private placement bonds. The HTM portfolio, net of the ACL, totaled $5.7 billion and $5.9 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The average life of the HTM portfolio was 9.5 years at September 30, 2023, compared to 9.3 years at December 31, 2022, and 9.0 years at September 30, 2022. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The securities portfolio generates the Company&#8217;s second largest component of interest income. The securities portfolio achieved an average yield on a tax-equivalent basis of 2.64% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, compared to 2.28% for the same period in 2022. 

At September 30, 2023, the unrealized pre-tax net loss on the AFS securities portfolio was $917.8 million, or 12.7% of the $7.2 billion amortized cost value, an increase of $146.2 million as compared to December 31, 2022. At September 30, 2023, the unrealized pre-tax net loss on the securities designated as HTM was $876.1 million, or 15.3% of amortized cost value, compared to $580.9 million at December 31, 2022. During 2022, the Company transferred securities with an amortized cost balance of $4.1 billion and a fair value of $3.8 billion from the AFS category to the HTM category. The transfer of securities was made at fair value at the time of transfer. The remaining balance of unrealized pre-tax losses related to transferred securities was $216.5 million as of September 30, 2023, and $247.0 million as of December 31, 2022, and was included in the amortized cost balance of HTM securities. See further information in Note 5, &#8220;Securities&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Deposits and Borrowed Funds 

Deposits increased $792.6 million, or 2.4%, from December 31, 2022 to September 30, 2023 and increased $1.6 billion, or 5.1%, from September 30, 2022 to September 30, 2023. Total interest-bearing balances increased $2.8 billion, partially offset by a decrease of $2.0 billion in noninterest-bearing deposits from December 31, 2022 to September 30, 2023. Total interest-bearing deposits increased $4.2 billion, partially offset by a decrease of $2.6 billion in noninterest-bearing deposits from September 30, 2022 to September 30, 2023. Deposits can fluctuate at quarter-end due to the operational nature of our commercial and institutional clients. The shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits is related to the recent increases in short-term and long-term interest rates, as well as recent industry volatility. Noninterest-bearing deposits were 33.7%, 40.6%, and 43.6% of total deposits at September 30, 2023, December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022, respectively. 

Deposits represent the Company&#8217;s primary funding source for its asset base. In addition to the core deposits garnered by the Company&#8217;s retail branch structure, the Company continues to focus on its cash management services, as well as its trust and investment company servicing businesses, in order to attract and retain additional deposits. Management believes a strong core deposit composition is one of the Company&#8217;s key strengths given its competitive product mix. 

As of September 30, 2023, there were an estimated $20.7 billion of uninsured deposits, a decrease of $3.9 billion as compared to December 31, 2022, and a decrease of $2.9 billion as compared to September 30, 2022. Estimated uninsured deposits comprised approximately 62.0%, 75.5%, and 74.4% of total deposits as of September 30, 2023, December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022, respectively. A portion of these uninsured deposits represent affiliate deposits and collateralized deposits. Affiliate deposits represent deposit accounts owned by the wholly owned subsidiaries of UMB Financial Corporation that are on deposit at UMB Bank, n.a. Collateralized deposits are public fund deposits or corporate trust deposits that are collateralized by high quality securities within the investment portfolio. Excluding affiliate deposits of $1.5 billion and collateralized deposits of $4.9 billion, the adjusted estimated uninsured deposits were $14.2 billion as of September 30, 2023. The adjusted ratio of estimated uninsured deposits, excluding affiliate and collateralized deposits, as a percentage of total deposits was approximately 42.6% as of September 30, 2023. The adjusted ratio of estimated uninsured deposits, excluding affiliate and collateralized deposits, as a percentage of total deposits was approximately 51.0% as of December 31, 2022, and 51.4% as of September 30, 2022. 

The Company participates in the IntraFi Cash Service program, which allows its customers to place deposits into the program to receive reciprocal FDIC insurance coverage. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $1.3 billion of deposits in the program. 

Long-term debt totaled $382.8 million as of September 30, 2023, compared to $381.3 million as of December 31, 2022, and $381.5 million as of September 30, 2022. In September 2022, the Company issued $110.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2032. The Company received $107.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The 

&#160; 

&#160; 

subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 6.25% and an effective rate of 6.64%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2027. 

In September 2020, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2030. The Company received $197.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 3.70% and an effective rate of 3.93%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2025. 

The remainder of the Company&#8217;s long-term debt was assumed from the acquisition of Marquette Financial Companies (Marquette) and consists of debt obligations payable to four unconsolidated trusts (Marquette Capital Trust I, Marquette Capital Trust II, Marquette Capital Trust III, and Marquette Capital Trust IV) that previously issued trust preferred securities. These long-term debt obligations have an aggregate contractual balance of $103.1 million. Interest rates on trust preferred securities are tied to the three-month term SOFR with spreads ranging from 133 basis points to 160 basis points and reset quarterly. The trust preferred securities have maturity dates ranging from January 2036 to September 2036. 

The Company has a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. which allows the Company to borrow up to $30.0 million for general working capital purposes. The interest rate applied to borrowed balances will be at the Company&#8217;s option either 1.40% above SOFR or 1.75% below the prime rate on the date of an advance. The Company pays a 0.4% unused commitment fee for unused portions of the revolving line of credit. As of September 30, 2023 , the Company had no advances outstanding on this revolving line of credit. 

Short-term debt totaled $2.3 billion as September 30, 2023 and consisted of two short-term borrowings with the FHLB of Des Moines totaling $1.5 billion and an $800.0 million borrowing with the BTFP. One FHLB borrowing has a principal balance of $500.0 million and an interest rate of 5.47% and is due in the fourth quarter of 2023, while the other has a principal balance of $1.0 billion and an interest rate of 5.04% and is due in the second quarter of 2024. The BTFP borrowing has a rate of 4.70% and is due in the fourth quarter of 2023. The level of borrowings could be impacted by earning asset mix changes in the Company&#8217;s balance sheet from the impacts of recent industry volatility. See further information in Note 7, &#8220;Borrowed Funds&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled $1.8 billion as of September 30, 2023, $2.2 billion at December 31, 2022, and $2.3 billion at September 30, 2022. Repurchase agreements are transactions involving the exchange of investment funds by the customer for securities by the Company under an agreement to repurchase the same or similar issues at an agreed-upon price and date. The level of borrowings could be impacted by earning asset mix changes in the Company&#8217;s balance sheet from the impacts of recent industry volatility. 

Capital and Liquidity 

The Company places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of a strong capital position, which promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. Higher levels of liquidity, however, bear corresponding costs, measured in terms of lower yields on short-term, more liquid earning assets and higher expenses for extended liability maturities. The Company manages capital for each subsidiary based upon the subsidiary&#8217;s respective risks and growth opportunities as well as regulatory requirements. 

Total shareholders&#8217; equity was $2.8 billion at September 30, 2023, a $139.6 million increase as compared to December 31, 2022, and a $283.1 million increase compared to September 30, 2022. 

The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized, at its April 26, 2022 and April 27, 2021 meetings, the repurchase of up to two million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock during the twelve months following each meeting (each a Repurchase Authorization). On July 25, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to one million shares of the Company's common stock, which will terminate on April 30, 2024. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company did not repurchase shares of common stock during 2023 pursuant to any of its announced repurchased plans. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, the Company acquired 330,999 shares of its common stock pursuant to the applicable Repurchase Authorization. 

At the Company&#8217;s quarterly board meeting, the Board of Directors declared a $0.39 per share quarterly cash dividend payable on January 2, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 11, 2023. 

Through the Company&#8217;s relationship with the FHLB of Des Moines, the Company owns $70.2 million of FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding sources through FHLB advances. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the Company places at the FHLB. The Company had two short-term advances totaling $1.5 billion outstanding at FHLB of Des Moines as of September 30, 2023. Additionally, in 2023, the FHLB of Des Moines issued a letter of credit for $150.0 million on behalf of the Company to secure deposits. This letter of credit will expire in January 2024. The Company&#8217;s remaining borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $436.7 million as of September 30, 2023. 

The Company had an $800.0 million short-term borrowing outstanding with the Federal Reserve Bank's BTFP as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s remaining borrowing capacity with the BTFP was $20.0 million and its remaining borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Discount Window was $10.2 billion. 

In addition to borrowing capacity with the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Discount Window as described above, the Company had additional liquidity of $7.4 billion available via cash, unpledged bond collateral, the federal funds market, and the IntraFi Cash Service program as of September 30, 2023. 

Risk-based capital guidelines established by regulatory agencies set minimum capital standards based on the level of risk associated with a financial institution&#8217;s assets. The Company has implemented the Basel III regulatory capital rules adopted by the FRB. Basel III capital rules include a minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%. A financial institution&#8217;s total capital is also required to equal at least 8% of risk-weighted assets. 

The risk-based capital guidelines indicate the specific risk weightings by type of asset. Certain off-balance sheet items (such as standby letters of credit and binding loan commitments) are multiplied by credit conversion factors to translate them into balance sheet equivalents before assigning them specific risk weightings. The Company is also required to maintain a leverage ratio equal to or greater than 4%. The leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of tier 1 core capital to total average assets, less goodwill and intangibles. 

U.S. banking agencies in December 2018 approved a final rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing banking organizations the option to phase in the day-one impact of CECL until the first quarter of 2023. In March 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The Company elected this alternative option instead of the one described in the December 2018 rule.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company&#8217;s main off-balance sheet arrangements are loan commitments, commercial and standby letters of credit, futures contracts and forward exchange contracts, which have maturity dates rather than payment due dates. See Note 10, &#8220;Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on these arrangements. The level of the outstanding commitments could be impacted by volatility in the economic markets and governmental responses to inflation, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain constraints. These changing conditions could have impacts on the consolidated balance sheets of the Company for the remainder of the year 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to customers and suppliers, allowance for credit losses, bad debts, investments, financing operations, long-lived assets, taxes, other contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Under different assumptions or conditions, actual results may differ from the recorded estimates. 

A summary of critical accounting policies is listed in the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; section of the Form 10-K.
