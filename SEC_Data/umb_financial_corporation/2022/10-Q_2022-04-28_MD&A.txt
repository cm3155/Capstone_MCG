Overview

&#160;

Over the past two years, the Company has experienced the impacts of the COVID-19 global pandemic (the COVID-19 pandemic, or the pandemic). Such impacts have included significant volatility in the global stock and 

&#160;

fixed income markets, reduction s in the target federal funds rate, the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, both including the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) administered by the Small Business Administration, and a variety of rulings from the Company&#8217;s banking regulators. 

&#160;

The Company continues to actively monitor developments related to COVID-19 and its impact to its business, customers, employees, counterparties, vendors, and service providers. During the first quarter of 2022, the Company&#8217;s results of operations included continued maintenance of the ACL at a level appropriate given the state of key macroeconomic variables utilized in the econometric models at March 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company continued to see impacts of the volatile equity and debt markets and low interest rate environment in its fee-based businesses.

&#160;

The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated certain actions related to the way the Company operates its business. The Company is carefully monitoring the activities of its vendors and other third-party service providers to mitigate the risks associated with any potential service disruptions. The length of time it may be required to operate under such circumstances and future degrees of disruption remain uncertain. While the Company has not experienced material adverse disruptions to its internal operations due to the pandemic, it continues to review evolving risks and developments.

The Company focuses on the following four core financial objectives. Management believes these objectives will guide its efforts to achieve its vision, to deliver the Unparalleled Customer Experience, all while seeking to improve net income and strengthen the balance sheet while undertaking prudent risk management.

The first financial objective is to continuously improve operating efficiencies. The Company has focused on identifying efficiencies that simplify our organizational and reporting structures, streamline back office functions, and take advantage of synergies and newer technologies among various platforms and distribution networks. The Company has identified and expects to continue identifying ongoing efficiencies through the normal course of business that, when combined with increased revenue, will contribute to improved operating leverage. During the first quarter of 2022, total revenue increased $31.0 million, or 10.2%, as compared to the first quarter of 2021, while noninterest expense increased $13.8 million, or 6.9%, for the same period. As part of the initiative to improve operating efficiencies, the Company continues to invest in technological advances that it believes will help management drive operating leverage in the future through improved data analysis and automation. The Company also continues to evaluate core systems and will invest in enhancements that it believes will yield operating efficiencies.

The second financial objective is to increase net interest income through profitable loan and deposit growth and the optimization of the balance sheet. During the first quarter of 2022, the Company had an increase in net interest income of $16.2 million, or 8.4%, from the same period in 2021. The Company has shown increased net interest income through the effects of increased volume and mix of average earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in rates compared to the first quarter of 2021. The increase in interest income was driven by an increase of $2.3 billion in average non-PPP loans. This increase was offset by reduced interest rates and decreased income from the PPP for the three months ended March 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021. Loan interest income related to loans recorded under the PPP decreased $11.5 million in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decline in average PPP balances of $1.2 billion. Average loan balances increased $1.1 billion, or 6.9%, for the first quarter of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. The funding for these assets was driven primarily by a 9.8% increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and a 43.8% increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased 24 basis points compared to the same period in 2021, in large part due to excess liquidity buildup, and repricing of earning assets in the low interest rate environment. These declines were partially offset by a three-basis-point decrease in cost of interest-bearing deposits. Net interest spread contracted by 24 basis points during the same period. The Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets and governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. These changing conditions could have impacts on the balance sheet and income statement of the Company for the remainder of the year. 

The third financial objective is to grow the Company&#8217;s revenue from noninterest sources. The Company seeks to grow noninterest revenues throughout all economic and interest rate cycles, while positioning itself to 

&#160;

benefit in periods of economic growth. Noninterest income increased $14.8 million, or 13.6%, to $123.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. This change is primarily due to an increase in the value of the company&#8217;s investment in Tattooed Chef, Inc. (TTCF), trust and securities processing, and service charges on deposits, offset by a decrease in trading and investment banking income. See greater detail below under Noninterest Income. The Company continues to emphasize its asset management, brokerage, bankcard services, healthcare services, and treasury management businesses. At March 31, 2022, noninterest income represented 37.0% of total revenues, compared to 35.9% at March 31, 2021. The recent economic changes have impacted fee income, especially those with assets tied to market values and interest rates. 

The fourth financial objective is effective capital management. The Company places a significant emphasis on maintaining a strong capital position, which management believes promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. The Company continues to maximize shareholder value through a mix of reinvesting in organic growth, evaluating acquisition opportunities that complement the Company&#8217;s strategies, increasing dividends over time, and appropriately utilizing a share repurchase program. At March 31, 2022, the Company had $2.7 billion in total shareholders&#8217; equity. This is a decrease of $209.8 million, or 7.1%, compared to total shareholders&#8217; equity at March 31, 2021. At March 31, 2022, the Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 13.55%. The Company repurchased 226,706 shares of common stock at an average price of $99.19 per share during the first quarter of 2022.

Earnings Summary

The following is a summary regarding the Company&#8217;s earnings for the first quarter of 2022. The changes identified in the summary are explained in greater detail below. The Company recorded net income of $106.0 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, compared to net income of $92.6 million for the same period a year earlier. Basic earnings per share for the first quarter of 2022 was $2.19 per share ($2.17 per share fully-diluted) compared to basic earnings per share of $1.93 per share ($1.91 per share fully-diluted) for the first quarter of 2021. Return on average assets and return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 were 1.10% and 14.65%, respectively, compared to 1.14% and 12.56%, respectively, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021. 

Net interest income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 increased $16.2 million, or 8.4%, compared to the same period in 2021. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, average earning assets increased by $6.0 billion, or 19.2%, compared to the same period in 2021. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 2.35% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, compared to 2.59% for the same period in 2021. 

The provision for credit losses increased by $1.0 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021. Provision expense for both periods represents a release of ACL for each period based on positive macro-economic data and portfolio credit metrics. The Company&#8217;s nonperforming loans increased $33.7 million to $110.4 million at March 31, 2022, compared to March 31, 2021. The ACL on loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to 1.01% as of March 31, 2022, compared to 1.23% at March 31, 2021. For a description of the Company&#8217;s methodology for computing the ACL, please see the summary discussion in the &#8220;Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; section included below.

Noninterest income increased by $14.8 million, or 13.6%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest Income.

Noninterest expense increased by $13.8 million, or 6.9%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest Expense.

&#160;

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is a significant source of the Company&#8217;s earnings and represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds the interest expense paid on liabilities. The volume of interest-earning assets and the related funding sources, the overall mix of these assets and liabilities, and the rates paid on each affect net interest income. Net interest income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 increased $16.2 million, or 8.4%, compared to the same period in 2021. 

Table 1 shows the impact of earning asset rate changes compared to changes in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. As illustrated in this table, net interest spread for the three months ended March 31, 2022 decreased 24 basis points as compared to the same period in 2021. Net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2022 decreased 24 basis points compared to the same period in 2021. The changes are primarily due to unfavorable rate variances on loans, partially offset by favorable volume variance on loans and securities and favorable rate variances on interest-bearing deposits. These variances have led to an increase in the Company&#8217;s net interest income during 2022, as compared to results for the same period in 2021. The changes compared to last year have been impacted by loan growth and increased liquidity, offset by lower loan rates. The Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets and governmental responses to changes in the economy. These changing conditions could have impacts on the balance sheet and income statement of the Company the remainder of the year. For the impact of the contribution from free funds, see the Analysis of Net Interest Margin within Table 2 below. Table 2 also illustrates how the changes in volume and interest rates have resulted in an increase in net interest income.

Table 1

AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS/YIELDS AND RATES (tax-equivalent basis) (unaudited, dollars in thousands) 

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the average earning assets and resulting yields, as well as the average interest-bearing liabilities and resulting yields, expressed in both dollars and rates. All average balances are daily average balances. The average yield on earning assets without the tax-equivalent basis adjustment would have been 2.40% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, and 2.66% for the same period in 2021.

Table 2 presents the dollar amount of change in net interest income and margin due to volume and rate. Table 2 also reflects the effect that interest-free funds have on net interest margin. The average balance of interest-free funds (total earning assets less interest-bearing liabilities) increased $4.1 billion for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. The benefit from interest-free funds remained flat compared to the same period in 2021.

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses

The ACL represents management&#8217;s judgment of the total expected losses included in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The Company&#8217;s process for recording the ACL is based on the evaluation of the Company&#8217;s lifetime historical loss experience, management&#8217;s understanding of the credit quality inherent in the loan portfolio, and the impact of the current economic environment, coupled with reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.

&#160;

A mathematical calculation of an estimate is made to assist in determining the adequacy and reasonableness of management&#8217;s recorded ACL. To develop the estimate, the Company follows the guidelines in ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses . The estimate reserves for assets held at amortized cost and any related credit deterioration in the Company&#8217;s available-for-sale debt security portfolio. Assets held at amortized cost include the Company&#8217;s loan book and held-to-maturity security portfolio. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The process involves the consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the specific segmentation of loans. These factors have been established over decades of financial institution experience and include economic observation and loan loss characteristics. This process is designed to produce a lifetime estimate of the losses, at a reporting date, that includes evaluation of historical loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and the qualitative framework outlined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the published 2020 Interagency Policy Statement. This process allows management to take a holistic view of the recorded ACL reserve and ensure that all significant and pertinent information is considered.

&#160;

The Company considers a variety of factors to ensure the safety and soundness of its estimate including a strong internal control framework, extensive methodology documentation, credit underwriting standards which encompass the Company&#8217;s desired risk profile, model validation, and ratio analysis. If the Company&#8217;s total ACL estimate, as determined in accordance with the approved ACL methodology, is either outside a reasonable range based on review of economic indicators or by comparison of historical ratio analysis, the ACL estimate is an outlier and management will investigate the underlying reason(s). Based on that investigation, issues or factors that previously had not been considered may be identified in the estimation process, which may warrant adjustments to estimated credit losses. 

The ending result of this process is a recorded consolidated ACL that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of the total expected losses included in the loan portfolio, held-to-maturity securities, and credit deterioration in available-for-sale securities.

Based on the factors above, management of the Company recorded a reduction of $6.5 million as provision for credit losses for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, compared to a reduction of $7.5 million for the same period in 2021. This change is the result of applying the methodology for computing the allowance for credit losses, coupled with the impacts of the current and forecasted economic environment. As illustrated in Table 3 below, the ACL on loans decreased to 1.01% of total loans as of March 31, 2022, compared to 1.23% of total loans as of March 31, 2021. 

Table 3 presents a summary of the Company&#8217;s ACL for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net charge-offs were $8.4 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, compared to $5.3 million for the same period in 2021. See &#8220;Credit Risk Management&#8221; under &#8220;Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; in this report for information relating to nonaccrual loans, past due loans, restructured loans and other credit risk matters.

Noninterest income increased by $14.8 million, or 13.6%, during the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. Table 4 above summarizes the components of noninterest income and the respective year-over-year comparison for each category.

Trust and securities processing income consists of fees earned on personal and corporate trust accounts, custody of securities services, trust investments and wealth management services, mutual fund assets, and alternative asset servicing. The increase in these fees for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, was primarily due to an increase in fund services and corporate trust revenues. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, fund services revenue increased $6.4 million, or 23.8%, corporate trust revenue increased $1.7 million, or 17.2%, offset by a decrease in trust services revenue of $3.4 million, or 19.2%. The recent volatile markets have impacted the income in this category. Since trust and securities processing fees are primarily asset-based, which are highly correlated to the change in market value of the assets, the related income for the remainder of the year will be affected by changes in the securities markets. Management continues to emphasize sales of services to both new and existing clients as well as increasing and improving the distribution channels.

Trading and investment banking fees for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 decreased $3.9 million, or 41.9%, compared to the same period in 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by decreased trading volume. The income in this category is market driven and impacted by general increases or decreases in trading volume.

Service charges on deposit accounts for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 increased by $2.7 million, or 12.1%, compared to the same period last year, driven by higher healthcare income related to customer termination fees.

Bankcard fees for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 increased $2.0 million, or 13.4%, compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was driven by higher interchange income. 

Investment securities losses, net for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 increased by $7.8 million, or 93.7%, compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was driven by the $13.9 million increased valuation on the company&#8217;s investment in TTCF, during the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by decreased gains on sales of available-for-sale securities and equity earnings on alternative investments. The income in this category is highly correlated to the change in market value of the assets, and the related income for the remainder of the year will be affected by changes in the securities markets. The Company&#8217;s investment portfolio is continually evaluated for opportunities to improve its performance and risk profile relative to market conditions and the Company&#8217;s interest rate expectations. This can result in differences from quarter to quarter in the amount of realized gains or losses on this portfolio.

&#160;

Other noninterest income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, increased $1.6 million, or 12.7%, driven by an increase of $5.0 million in derivative income, offset by decreased gains on sale of other assets of $2.1 million and a decrease of $1.3 million in mortgage loan gains .

Noninterest income increased $18.5 million, or 226.7%, over the same period in 2021 primarily due to an increase of $15.0 million in investment securities gains and $5.0 million in derivative income. Noninterest expense increased $9.9 million, or 14.2%, to $79.6 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021.

For the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, Institutional Banking net income increased $3.9 million, or 24.3%, compared to the same period last year. Net interest income increased $4.1 million, or 18.6%, compared to the same period last year, driven by an increase in funds transfer pricing due to an increase in deposit balances. Noninterest income increased $4.8 million, or 7.1%, primarily due to increases of $6.4 million in fund services income and $1.7 million in corporate trust income, both recorded in trust and securities processing revenue, and $1.3 million in service charges on deposit accounts due to healthcare customer transfer and conversion fees. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $3.9 million in bond trading income driven by lower trading volume. Noninterest expense increased $4.3 million, or 6.0%, primarily driven by an increase of $3.3 million in salary and employee benefits expense, an increase of $0.7 million in bankcard expense and an increase of $0.7 million in marketing and business development expense.

Loans represent the Company&#8217;s largest source of interest income. In addition to growing the commercial loan portfolio, management believes its middle market commercial business and its consumer business, including home equity and credit card loan products, are the market niches that represent its best opportunity to cross-sell fee-related services and generate additional noninterest income for the Company.

Actual loan balances totaled $17.7 billion as of March 31, 2022, and increased $560.8 million, or 3.3%, compared to December 31, 2021, and increased $1.2 billion, or 7.5%, compared to March 31, 2021. Compared to December 31, 2021, commercial and industrial loans increased $355.8 million, or 4.9%, commercial real estate loans increased $152.0 million, or 2.4%, and consumer real estate loans increased $73.3 million, or 3.2%. Compared to March 31, 2021, commercial and industrial loans increased $444.5 million, or 6.2%, consumer real estate loans increased $393.6 million, or 19.7%, commercial real estate loans increased $269.2 million, or 4.4%, and leases and other loans increased $89.1 million, or 49.5%. During the first quarter of 2022, the Company sold its factoring loan portfolio to an alternative financing company. These loans had actual balances of $107.2 million and $152.4 million as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively, and had been included in the specialty lending loan segment. See further information in Note 4, &#8220;Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Nonaccrual, past due and restructured loans are discussed under &#8220;Credit Risk Management&#8221; within &#8220;Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; in this report.

Investment Securities 

The Company&#8217;s investment portfolio contains trading, AFS, and HTM securities, as well as FRB stock, FHLB stock, and other miscellaneous investments. Investment securities totaled $13.5 billion as of March 31, 2022, and $13.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, and comprised 34.9% and 33.8% of the Company&#8217;s earning assets, respectively, as of those dates. 

During the first quarter of 2022, securities with an amortized cost of $3.0 billion and a fair value of $2.9 billion were transferred from the available-for-sale classification to the held-to-maturity classification as the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. The transfer of securities was made at fair value at the time of transfer. See further information in Note 5, &#8220;Securities&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company&#8217;s AFS securities portfolio comprised 63.3% of the Company&#8217;s investment securities portfolio at March 31, 2022 and 86.7% at December 31, 2021. The Company&#8217;s AFS securities portfolio provides liquidity as a result of the composition and average life of the underlying securities. This liquidity can be used to fund loan growth or to offset the outflow of traditional funding sources. The average life of the AFS securities portfolio was 74.1 months at March 31, 2022, compared to 67.6 months at December 31, 2021, and 83.9 months at March 31, 

&#160;

202 1 . In addition to providing a potential source of liquidity, the AFS securities portfolio can be used as a tool to manage interest rate sensitivity. The Company&#8217;s goal in the management of its AFS securities portfolio is to maximize return within the Company&#8217;s parameters of liquidity goals, interest rate risk, and credit risk. 

Management expects collateral pledging requirements for public funds, loan demand, and deposit funding to be the primary factors impacting changes in the level of AFS securities. There were $9.3 billion and $10.2 billion of securities pledged to secure U.S. Government deposits, other public deposits, certain trust deposits, derivative transactions, and repurchase agreements at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Of these amounts, $148.7 million and $171.2 million of securities at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, were pledged at the Federal Reserve Discount Window but were unencumbered as of those dates.

The Company&#8217;s HTM securities portfolio consists of U.S. agency-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, and private placement bonds, which are issued primarily to refinance existing revenue bonds in the healthcare and education sectors. The HTM portfolio, net of the ACL, totaled $4.6 billion at March 31, 2022 and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2021. The average life of the HTM portfolio was 8.6 years at March 31, 2022, compared to 5.2 years at December 31, 2021, and 6.1 years at March 31, 2021.

The securities portfolio generates the Company&#8217;s second largest component of interest income. The securities portfolio achieved an average yield on a tax-equivalent basis of 2.21% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, compared to 2.23% for the same period in 2021.

Deposits and Borrowed Funds

Deposits decreased $1.2 billion, or 3.5%, from December 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022 and increased $6.1 billion, or 21.5%, from March 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022. Total interest-bearing deposits decreased $841.5 million and total noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $395.9 million from December 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022. Total noninterest-bearing deposits increased $4.3 billion, and interest-bearing deposits increased $1.7 billion from March 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022. The increase in deposits as compared to prior periods is related to the excess liquidity in the market created by the PPP and customer behavior changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Deposits represent the Company&#8217;s primary funding source for its asset base. In addition to the core deposits garnered by the Company&#8217;s retail branch structure, the Company continues to focus on its cash management services, as well as its trust and mutual fund servicing businesses, in order to attract and retain additional deposits. Management believes a strong core deposit composition is one of the Company&#8217;s key strengths given its competitive product mix.

Long-term debt totaled $272.0 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $271.5 million as of December 31, 2021, and $270.1 million as of March 31, 2021. In September 2020, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2030. The Company received $197.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 3.70% and an effective rate of 3.93%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2025. The remainder of the Company&#8217;s long-term debt was assumed from the acquisition of Marquette Financial Companies (Marquette) and consists of debt obligations payable to four unconsolidated trusts (Marquette Capital Trust I, Marquette Capital Trust II, Marquette Capital Trust III, and Marquette Capital Trust IV) that previously issued trust preferred securities. These long-term debt obligations have an aggregate contractual balance of $103.1 million. Interest rates on trust preferred securities are tied to the three-month LIBOR rate with spreads ranging from 133 basis points to 160 basis points, and reset quarterly. The trust preferred securities have maturity dates ranging from January 2036 to September 2036.

The Company has a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. which allows the Company to borrow up to $30.0 million for general working capital purposes. The interest rate applied to borrowed balances will be at the Company&#8217;s option either 1.25% above LIBOR or 1.75% below the prime rate on the date of an advance. The Company pays a 0.4% unused commitment fee for unused portions of the revolving line of credit. As of March 31, 2022, the Company had no advances outstanding on this revolving line of credit. This borrowing is included in the Short-term debt line on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

&#160;

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement s to repurchase totaled $ 2.8 billion a s of March 31, 202 2 , $ 3.2 billion at December 31, 202 1 , and $ 2.8 billion at March 31, 202 1 . Repurchase agreements are transactions involving the exchange of investment funds by the customer for securities by the Company under an agreement to repurchase the same or similar issues at an agreed-upon price and date. The level of borrowings could be impacted by earning asset mix changes in the Company&#8217;s balance sheet from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Capital and Liquidity

The Company places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of a strong capital position, which promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. Higher levels of liquidity, however, bear corresponding costs, measured in terms of lower yields on short-term, more liquid earning assets and higher expenses for extended liability maturities. The Company manages capital for each subsidiary based upon the subsidiary&#8217;s respective risks and growth opportunities as well as regulatory requirements.

Total shareholders&#8217; equity was $2.7 billion at March 31, 2022, a $397.0 million decrease compared to December 31, 2021, and a $209.8 million decrease compared to March 31, 2021. 

The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized, at its April 26, 2022, April 27, 2021, and April 28, 2020 meetings, the repurchase of up to two million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock during the twelve months following each meeting (each a Repurchase Authorization). During the three-month periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company acquired 226,706 shares and 52,658 shares, respectively, of its common stock pursuant to the applicable Repurchase Authorization. 

At the Company&#8217;s quarterly board meeting, the Board of Directors declared a $0.37 per share quarterly cash dividend payable on July 1, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 10, 2022.

Through the Company&#8217;s relationship with the FHLB of Des Moines, the Company owns $10.0 million of FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding sources through FHLB advances. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the Company places at the FHLB. The Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $1.6 billion as of March 31, 2022. The Company had no outstanding FHLB advances at FHLB of Des Moines as of March 31, 2022.

Risk-based capital guidelines established by regulatory agencies set minimum capital standards based on the level of risk associated with a financial institution&#8217;s assets. The Company has implemented the Basel III regulatory capital rules adopted by the FRB. Basel III capital rules include a minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%. A financial institution&#8217;s total capital is also required to equal at least 8% of risk-weighted assets. 

The risk-based capital guidelines indicate the specific risk weightings by type of asset. Certain off-balance sheet items (such as standby letters of credit and binding loan commitments) are multiplied by credit conversion factors to translate them into balance sheet equivalents before assigning them specific risk weightings. The Company is also required to maintain a leverage ratio equal to or greater than 4%. The leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of tier 1 core capital to total average assets, less goodwill and intangibles. 

&#160;

U.S. banking agencies in December 2018 approved a final rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing banking organizations the option to phase in the day-one impact of CECL until the first quarter of 2023. In March 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The Company is electing this alternative option instead of the one described in the December 2018 rule.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company&#8217;s main off-balance sheet arrangements are loan commitments, commercial and standby letters of credit, futures contracts and forward exchange contracts, which have maturity dates rather than payment due dates. See Note 10, &#8220;Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on these arrangements. The level of the outstanding commitments will be impacted by financial impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to customers and suppliers, allowance for credit losses, bad debts, investments, financing operations, long-lived assets, taxes, other contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Under different assumptions or conditions, actual results may differ from the recorded estimates. 

A summary of critical accounting policies is listed in the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; section of the Form 10-K.
