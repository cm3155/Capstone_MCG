 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

At June 30, 2023, total assets were $118.8 billion, up $28.7 billion compared to December 31, 2022. Total deposits were $88.5 billion at June 30, 2023, up $29.8 billion from December 31, 2022. These year-to-date increases were primarily due to our March 20, 2023, assumption of a substantial amount of the deposits and certain identified liabilities and the acquisition of certain assets and lines of business of Signature Bridge Bank, from the FDIC, as receiver for Signature Bridge Bank (the &#8220;Signature Transaction&#8221;). See Note 3 &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Signature Transaction 

For the three months ended June 30, 2023, net income was $413 million as compared to $2.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was $405 million, compared to $2.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Diluted EPS totaled $0.55 for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $2.87 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

Second quarter 2023 and first quarter 2023 net income and diluted EPS were impacted by a bargain purchase gain of $141 million and $2.0 billion, respectively arising from the purchase and assumption of certain assets and liabilities in the Signature Transaction. Also included in net income for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and March 31, 2023, were merger related and restructuring expenses of $109 million and $67 million, respectively, related to both the Signature Transaction and the Flagstar acquisition. In addition, first quarter 2023 results were impacted by an initial provision for credit losses totaling $132 million for the loans acquired in the Signature Transaction. 

Loan Portfolio 

At June 30, 2023, total C&#38;I loans were $23.9 billion compared to $12.3 billion at December 31, 2022. The majority of the increase is attributable to the $10.0 billion of C&#38;I loans acquired in the Signature Transaction along with growth in the mortgage warehouse portfolio. On a linked quarter basis, mortgage warehouse loans rose $638 million or 12 percent due to using our market position in this vertical to capitalize on several competitors exiting the market. 

The multi-family loan portfolio was $37.8 billion at June 30, 2023, down slightly compared to $38.1 billion at December 31, 2022. The slight decline during this period was due to a combination of higher interest rates and our increasing ability to diversify our loan portfolio as a result of our recent acquisition. At June 30, 2023, multi-family loans represented 45 percent of total loans, compared to 55 percent at December 31, 2022, further demonstrating the reduction of our concentration in this asset class. 

Commercial loans (commercial real estate and acquisition, development and construction) increased $2.6 billion at June 30, 2023 to $13.1 billion compared to $10.5 billion at December 31, 2022 largely attributable to the Signature Transaction. 

One-to-four family residential loans totaled $5.9 billion at June 30, 2023, representing seven percent of total loans compared to $5.8 billion or eight percent of total loans at December 31, 2022. Other loans totaled $2.6 billion at June 30, 2023 compared to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2022. The other loan portfolio consists mostly of consumer loans. 

Loans held-for-sale at June 30, 2023 totaled $2.2 billion, up from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2022. 

Deposit Base 

Deposits at June 30, 2023 totaled $88.5 billion up $29.8 billion compared to $58.7 billion at December 31, 2022 driven primarily by an increase to $5.9 billion of custodial deposits related to the Signature transaction. 

Our deposit base includes $37.8 billion of uninsured deposits at June 30, 2023 a net increase of $18.2 billion as compared to December 31, 2022 due to the Signature Transaction. This represents 42.7 percent of our total deposits. These amounts were determined based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes and exclude internal accounts. We also have $37.7 billion of total ready liquidity (cash and cash equivalents, unpledged securities, Fed Funds access and FHLB borrowing capacity). Our total ready liquidity approximately matches the balance of our uninsured deposits. 

Net Interest Income 

For the three months ended June 30, 2023, net interest income totaled $900 million, up $345 million or 62 percent compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The current quarter&#8217;s results include a full-quarter&#8217;s contribution from the Signature Transaction, compared to only a partial month Signature contribution in the first quarter of this year. 

For the three months ended June 30, 2023, the NIM was 3.21 percent up 61 basis points compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The linked-quarter improvement was due to the Signature Transaction which drove higher levels of average interest-earnings assets, specifically loans held for investment and average cash and cash equivalent balances, including custodial deposits related to the Signature Transaction. In addition, we continued to benefit from the higher interest rate environment, which positively impacted the yields on our assets partially offset by a higher cost of funds and higher average interest-bearing liabilities. Average interest-earning assets increased $25.6 billion or 30 percent to $112.3 billion, while the average yield rose 54 basis points to 5.34 percent. Average interest-bearing liabilities grew $7.2 billion or 10.28 percent to $77.4 billion, while the average cost of funds increased 33 basis points to 3.10 percent. 

Asset Quality 

Our asset quality metrics remained strong during the second quarter of 2023 despite increases in NPLs and NPAs attributable to certain loans acquired in the Signature Transaction and Flagstar acquisition. At June 30, 2023, NPAs to total assets equaled 0.21 percent compared to 0.14 percent at March 31, 2023 while NPLs to total loans equaled 0.28 percent compared to 0.20 percent at December 31, 2022. Repossessed assets of $13 million were relatively unchanged compared to the $13 million recorded in the prior quarter. 

Recent Events 

Declaration of Dividend on Common Shares 

On July 25, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share on the Company's common stock. The dividend is payable on August 17, 2023 to common stockholders of record as of August 7, 2023. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is our primary source of income. Its level is a function of the average balance of our interest-earning assets, the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by various external factors, including the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FOMC, and market interest rates. 

The cost of our deposits and borrowed funds is largely based on short-term rates of interest, the level of which is partially impacted by the actions of the FOMC. 

While the target federal funds rate generally impacts the cost of our short-term borrowings and deposits, the yields on our held-for-investment loans and other interest-earning assets are not as sensitive to intermediate-term market interest rates. 

Another factor that impacts the yields on our interest-earning assets&#8212;and our net interest income&#8212;is the income generated by our multi-family and CRE loans and securities when they prepay. Since prepayment income is recorded as interest income, an increase or decrease in its level will also be reflected in the average yields (as applicable) on our loans, securities, and interest-earning assets, and therefore in our net interest income, our net interest rate spread, and our net interest margin. 

It should be noted that the level of prepayment income on loans recorded in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay during that time. Such activity is largely dependent on such external factors as current market conditions, including real estate values, and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates. This impact is most prevalent in our multi-family portfolio. In addition, while a decline in market interest rates may trigger an increase in refinancing and, therefore, prepayment income, so too may an increase in market interest rates. It is not unusual for borrowers to lock in lower interest rates when they expect, or see, that market interest rates are rising rather than risk refinancing later at a still higher interest rate. The impact of prepayments on the current quarter was minimal. 

Comparison to Prior Quarter 

Net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was $900 million, up $345 million or 62 percent compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. This quarter&#8217;s results include a full-quarter&#8217;s contribution from the Signature Transaction compared to only a partial month contribution in the first quarter of this year which is the primary cause of most of the linked-quarter differences explained below. 

&#8226; Interest income on mortgage and other loans, net, totaled $1.2 billion, up $294 million compared to first quarter of this year. This increase was driven by a $13.0 billion or 18.42 percent increase in average loan balances to $83.8 billion. This is primarily due to the full quarter activity related to the Signature Transaction. Additionally, we had a 63 basis points increase in the average loan yield to 5.55 percent from 4.92 percent in the prior quarter due primarily to the rising interest rate environment. 

&#8226; Interest income on securities was positively impacted by a 32 basis points increase in the average yield to 4.18 percent from 3.86 percent along with a $1.1 billion or 9.85 percent decrease in the average securities balance to $9.8 billion. 

&#8226; Interest income on cash and cash equivalents increased $177 million driven by a seven basis points increase in the average yield to 5.03 percent driven by higher short-term market rates, coupled with an increase in the average balance of $14.0 billion driven by the Signature Transaction. 

&#8226; Interest expense on average interest-bearing deposits increased $158 million to $441 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023, driven by a 58 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits due to rising interest rates and competition for deposits. Additionally, our average interest earning deposits grew $11.3 billion, or 23.69 percent, to $59.2 billion. The balance growth reflects the December acquisition of Flagstar and the March Signature Transaction. 

&#8226; Interest expense on borrowed funds decreased $39 million or 20 percent to $157 million driven by a nine basis point decrease in rates in addition to a $4.1 billion or 18.5 percent decrease in the average balance to $18.2 billion, partially due to our shift to lower cost deposits. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

For the six months ended June 30, 2023, net interest income totaled $1.5 billion, up $764 million or 111 percent compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The year-to-date results include a six month contribution from the Flagstar acquisition and three months plus a partial-month contribution from the Signature Transaction which were not part of the Company in the first half of 2022. 

&#8226; Interest income on mortgages and other loans, net was driven by a $31.0 billion or 66.7 percent increase in average loan balances to $77.5 billion. This is primarily driven by the December 2022 acquisition of Flagstar and the March 2023 Signature Transaction. Additionally, we had a 173 basis point increase in the average loan yield to 5.25 percent in the current year quarter due primarily to the rising interest rate environment. 

&#8226; Interest income on securities was positively impacted by a 175 basis point increase in the average yield to 4.01 percent from 2.26 percent along with a $3.7 billion or 56.1 percent increase in the average securities balance to $10.3 billion primarily driven by the six month contribution from the Flagstar acquisition. 

&#8226; Interest-earning cash and cash equivalents reflected a 438 basis point increase in the average yield to 5.02 percent driven by higher short-term market rates and an increase in the average balance of $8.9 billion driven by the Signature Transaction. 

&#8226; Interest expense on average interest-bearing deposits increased $651 million to $724 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023, driven by a 227 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits due to rising interest rates. Average interest earning deposits grew $20.7 billion, or 62.8 percent, to $53.6 billion. The balance growth primarily reflects the December acquisition of Flagstar and the March Signature Transaction. 

&#8226; Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $215 million or 156 percent to $353 million driven by a 176 basis point increase in rates in addition to a $4.5 billion or 28.3 percent increase in the average balance to $20.3 billion primarily driven by the December acquisition of Flagstar. 

Net Interest Margin 

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our average balance sheet for the periods indicated, including the average yields on our interest-earning assets and the average costs of our interest-bearing liabilities. Average yields are calculated by dividing the interest income produced by the average balance of interest-earning assets. Average costs are calculated by dividing the interest expense produced by the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average balances for the periods are derived from average balances that are calculated daily. The average yields and costs include fees, as well as premiums and discounts (including mark-to-market adjustments from acquisitions), that are considered adjustments to such average yields and costs.

Comparison to Prior Quarter 

The Company's net interest margin for the three months ended June 30, 2023, was 3.21 percent up 61 basis points compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase was driven by both a higher level of average earnings assets due to the Signature Transaction being included for the entire quarter compared to only a partial month during the first quarter of this year, along with higher yields on those assets. This was partially offset by a higher cost of funds and higher average interest-bearing liabilities reflecting a full quarter impact of the Signature Transaction. 

Average interest-earning assets increased $25.6 billion or 29.58 percent to $112.3 billion, while the average yield rose 54 basis points to 5.34 percent. Average interest-bearing liabilities grew $7.2 billion or 10.28 percent to $77.4 billion, while the average cost of funds increased 33 basis points to 3.10 percent. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

The Company's net interest margin for the six months ended June 30, 2023, was 2.94 percent compared to 2.48 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase was driven by both a higher level of average earnings assets due to the Flagstar acquisition and Signature Transaction, along with significantly higher yields on those assets reflecting the higher interest rate environment. This was partially offset by a higher cost of funds and higher average interest-bearing liabilities. 

Average interest-earnings assets increased $43.9 billion or 78.67 percent to $99.7 billion, while the average yield increased 186 basis points to 5.10 percent. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $25.1 billion or 51.61 percent to $73.9 billion, while the average cost of funds increased 207 basis points to 2.94 percent. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Comparison to Prior Quarter 

The three months ended June 30, 2023 provision for credit losses totaled $49 million including increases of $13 million related to specific reserves for new non-accrual loans and the remainder driven by changes in the macroeconomic forecast. The three months ended March 31, 2023 provision for credit losses was $170 million including a $132 million initial provision for credit losses related to the initial ACL measurement of non-PCD acquired loans from the Signature Transaction and a $20 million provision for credit losses on legacy Signature Bank debt securities held by the Company prior to the transaction. The remaining difference was primarily driven by loan growth and changes in the macroeconomic forecast. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

The six months ended June 30, 2023 provision for credit losses was $219 million compared to $7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The 2023 provision includes a $132 million initial provision for credit losses related to the initial ACL measurement of non-PCD acquired loans from the Signature Transaction, a $20 million provision for credit losses on Signature debt securities held by the Company. The remaining difference was primarily driven by loan growth, specific reserves for new nonaccrual loans and changes in the macroeconomic forecast. 

For additional information about our methodologies for recording recoveries of, and provisions for, credit losses, please refer to Critical Accounting Policies in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which is available on our website, under the Investor Relations section, or on the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission, at sec.gov. 

Non-Interest Income 

We generate non-interest income through a variety of sources, including&#8212;among others&#8212;fee income (in the form of retail deposit fees and charges on loans); income from our investment in BOLI; net return on our MSR asset; net gain on loan sales and securitizations; and &#8220;other&#8221; sources, including the revenues produced through the sale of third-party investment products and loan subservicing. 

The following table summarizes our non-interest income for the respective periods:

Comparison to Prior Quarter 

For the three months ended June 30, 2023, non-interest income totaled $302 million as compared to $2.1 billion in the first quarter. The second quarter includes a bargain purchase gain of $141 million as compared to $2.0 billion in the first quarter related to the Signature transaction. Second-quarter 2023 non-interest income includes a full-quarter's contribution from Signature compared to a partial month in the first quarter. This benefited fee income and loan administration income which includes a $42 million benefit for income related to servicing loans on behalf of the FDIC receivership. Loan admin income otherwise decreased due to SOFR-referenced costs related to custodial deposits which are net settled as part of certain servicing contracts. 

Second quarter 2023 non-interest income includes a gain on loan sales of $25 million compared to $20 million during the first quarter, with a gain on sale margin of 56 basis points compared to 76 basis points last quarter. The net return on mortgage servicing rights was $25 million or 9.7 percent for the second quarter compared to $22 million or 8.5 percent for the first quarter. Net loan administration income totaled $39 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 driven by subservicing income related to the Signature transaction. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

Non-interest income increased $2.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to the bargain purchase gain of $2.1 billion related to the Signature Transaction. Increases in non-interest income were also driven by the inclusion of the Flagstar acquisition and Signature Transaction including a $63 million increase in fee income, net return on mortgage servicing rights of $47 million, gain on loan sales of $45 million and loan administration income of $46 million. 

Non-Interest Expense 

Comparison to Prior Quarter 

For the three months ended June 30, 2023, non-interest expenses totaled $661 million, up $185 million, or 39 percent compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. Total operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2023 were $515 million, up $123 million compared to $392 million for the first quarter 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the second quarter 2023 including a full quarter of Signature expenses, including costs to retain key business personnel, compared to only a partial month during first-quarter 2023. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

Non-interest expense increased $858 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. Total operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2023 were up $639 million compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. Both increases were primarily due the inclusion of Flagstar and Signature activity. 

Income Tax Expense 

Comparison to Prior Quarter 

For the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company reported a provision for income taxes of $79 million compared $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Income tax expense for both the current quarter and for the first quarter 2023 was impacted the Signature Transaction and Flagstar acquisition, respectively. The effective tax rate was 16.2 percent for the second quarter 2023. 

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 

For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company reported a provision for income taxes of $80 million, compared to $111 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Income tax expense for the current year was impacted the Signature Transaction and Flagstar acquisition.

Total assets increased $28.7 billion to $118.8 billion as of June 30, 2023, compared to $90.1 billion at December 31, 2022 due to the Flagstar acquisition which closed December 1, 2022, the Signature Transaction, which closed on March 20, 2023 and organic loan growth. 

The Company acquired approximately $25 billion of cash, approximately $12 billion, of loans, net of purchase accounting adjustments ("PAA"), $34 billion of deposits, net of PAA, and $2 billion of other liabilities related to the Signature Transaction. 

Total loans and leases held for investment were $83.3 billion at June 30, 2023 compared to $69.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was driven by the aforementioned loans acquired from the Signature Transaction and organic loan growth. 

The securities portfolio totaled $7.8 billion at June 30, 2023, compared to $9.1 billion at December 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, the Company has no held-to-maturity securities portfolio and all of the Company&#8217;s securities were designated as &#8220;Available-for-Sale&#8221;, unchanged from December 31, 2022. 

Total deposits grew $29.8 billion, or 51 percent to $88.5 billion at June 30, 2023 compared to $58.7 billion at December 31, 2022 primarily driven by the deposits assumed in the Signature Transaction. Included in the June 30, 2023 balance are $5.9 billion in non-interest-bearing custodial deposits related to the Signature Transaction. 

Wholesale borrowings at June 30, 2023 were $15.4 billion compared to $20.3 billion at December 31, 2022, reflecting the use of some of the cash acquired from the Signature transaction to reduce the level of FHLB-NY borrowings.

Multi-Family Loans 

The multi-family loans we produce are primarily secured by non-luxury residential apartment buildings in New York City that feature rent-regulated units and below-market rents. 

The multi-family loan portfolio was $37.8 billion at June 30, 2023, down slightly compared to $38.1 billion at December 31, 2022 due to a combination of higher interest rates and our loan diversification strategy. 

The majority of our multi-family loans were secured by rental apartment buildings. 

At June 30, 2023, $21.8 billion or 59 percent of the Company&#8217;s total multi-family loan portfolio is secured by properties in New York State and, therefore, are subject to the new rent regulation laws. The weighted average LTV of the New York State rent regulated multi-family portfolio was 61 percent as of June 30, 2023 , unchanged from December 31, 2022. 

In addition to underwriting multi-family loans on the basis of the buildings&#8217; income and condition, we consider the borrowers&#8217; credit history, profitability, and building management expertise. Borrowers are required to present evidence of their ability to repay the loan from the buildings&#8217; current rent rolls, their financial statements, and related documents. 

While a percentage of our multi-family loans are ten-year fixed rate credits, the vast majority of our multi-family loans feature a term of ten or twelve years, with a fixed rate of interest for the first five or seven years of the loan, and an alternative rate of interest in years six through ten or eight through twelve. The rate charged in the first five or seven years is generally based on intermediate-term interest rates plus a spread. 

During the remaining years, the loan resets to an annually adjustable rate that is indexed to CME Term SOFR , plus a spread. Alternately, the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the five-year fixed advance rate of the FHLB-NY, plus a spread. The fixed-rate option also requires the payment of one percentage point of the then-outstanding loan balance. In either case, the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five-or seven-year term. As the rent roll increases, the typical property owner seeks to refinance the mortgage, and generally does so before the loan reprices in year six or eight. 

Multi-family loans that refinance within the first five or seven years are typically subject to an established prepayment penalty schedule. Depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment, the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the then-current loan balance. If a loan extends past the fifth or seventh year and the borrower selects the fixed-rate option, the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten or eight through twelve. For example, a ten-year multi-family loan that prepays in year three would 

generally be expected to pay a prepayment penalty equal to three percentage points of the remaining principal balance. A twelve-year multi-family loan that prepays in year one or two would generally be expected to pay a penalty equal to five percentage points. 

Because prepayment penalties assessed to the borrower are recorded as interest income, they are reflected in the average yields on our loans and interest-earning assets, our net interest rate spread and net interest margin, and the level of net interest income we record. No assumptions are involved in the recognition of prepayment income, as such income is recorded when the cash is received. 

Our success as a multi-family lender partly reflects the solid relationships we have developed with the market&#8217;s leading mortgage brokers, who are familiar with our lending practices, our underwriting standards, and our long-standing practice of basing our loans on the cash flows produced by the properties. The process of producing such loans is generally four to six weeks in duration and, because the multi-family market is largely broker-driven, the expense incurred in sourcing such loans is substantially reduced. 

We believe our underwriting quality of multi-family lending is distinctive. This reflects the nature of the buildings securing our loans, our underwriting process and standards, and the generally conservative LTV ratios our multi-family loans feature at origination. Historically, a relatively small percentage of the multi-family loans that have transitioned to non-performing status have resulted in actual losses, even when the credit cycle has taken a downward turn. 

We primarily underwrite our multi-family loans based on the current cash flows produced by the collateral property, with a reliance on the &#8220;income&#8221; approach to appraising the properties, rather than the &#8220;sales&#8221; approach. We also consider a variety of other factors, including the physical condition of the underlying property; the net operating income of the mortgaged premises prior to debt service; the DSCR, which is the ratio of the property&#8217;s net operating income to its debt service; and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value (i.e., the LTV) of the property. 

In addition to requiring a minimum DSCR of 120 percent on multi-family buildings, we obtain a security interest in the personal property located on the premises, and an assignment of rents and leases. Our multi-family loans generally represent no more than 75 percent of the lower of the appraised value or the sales price of the underlying property, and typically feature an amortization period of 30 years. In addition, our multi-family loans may contain an initial interest-only period which typically does not exceed two years; however, these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis. 

Accordingly, while our multi-family lending niche has not been immune to downturns in the credit cycle, the limited number of losses we have recorded, even in adverse credit cycles, suggests that the multi-family loans we produce involve less credit risk than certain other types of loans. In general, buildings that are subject to rent regulation have tended to be stable, with occupancy levels remaining more or less constant over time. Because the rents are typically below market and the buildings securing our loans are generally maintained in good condition, they have been more likely to retain their tenants in adverse economic times. In addition, we exclude any short-term property tax exemptions and abatement benefits the property owners receive when we underwrite our multi-family loans. 

The following table presents a geographical analysis of the multi-family loans in our held-for-investment loan portfolio: 

At June 30, 2023 Multi-Family Loans (dollars in millions) Amount Percent of Total New York City: Manhattan $ 7,175 19 % Brooklyn 6,285 17 % Bronx 3,630 10 % Queens 2,852 8 % Staten Island 135 &#8212; % Total New York City $ 20,077 54 % New Jersey 5,087 13 % Long Island 548 1 % Total Metro New York $ 25,712 68 % Other New York State 1,194 3 % Pennsylvania 3,738 10 % Florida 1,686 4 % Ohio 1,035 3 % Arizona 440 1 % All other states 4,026 11 % Total $ 37,831 100 % 

Commercial Real Estate 

At June 30, 2023, CRE loans represented $10.6 billion, or 12.7 percent, of total loans held for investment, reflecting a $2.1 billion increase when compared to $8.5 billion at December 31, 2022. Approximately $1.9 billion was due to the Signature Transaction. 

CRE loans represented $278 million, or 5.6 percent, of the loans we originated in the second quarter 2023 as compared to $309 million, or 9.4 percent in the first quarter 2023. 

The CRE loans we produce are secured by income-producing properties such as office buildings, retail centers, mixed-use buildings, and multi-tenanted light industrial properties. At June 30, 2023, the largest concentration of CRE loans were secured by properties in the metro New York City area, refer to the Geographical Analysis table included below for additional details. 

Approximately $3.4 billion of the CRE portfolio are office properties with an average balance of approximately $11 million and located primarily in the New York metro area. There are no non-performing loans or recent charge-offs with respect to this portfolio as of June 30, 2023. 

The terms of more than half of our CRE loans are similar to the terms of our multi-family credits which primarily feature a fixed rate of interest for the first five years of the loan that is generally based on intermediate-term interest rates plus a spread. In addition to customary fixed rate terms, we now also offer floating rates advances indexed to CME Term SOFR. These products are generally offered in combination with interest rate cap or swaps that provide borrowers with additional optionality to manage their interest rate risk. Following the initial fixed rate period, the loan resets to an adjustable interest rate that is indexed to CME Term SOFR, plus a spread. Alternately, the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the five-year fixed advance rate of the FHLB-NY plus a spread. The fixed-rate option also requires the payment of an amount equal to one percentage point of the then-outstanding loan balance. In either case, the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five- or seven-year term. 

Prepayment penalties apply to certain of our CRE loans, as they do our multi-family credits. Depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment, the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of 

the then-current loan balance. If a loan extends past the fifth or seventh year and the borrower selects the fixed rate option, the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten or eight through twelve. 

The repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties. To minimize our credit risk, we originate CRE loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards, and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the property&#8217;s current income stream and DSCR. The approval of a loan also depends on the borrower&#8217;s credit history, profitability, and expertise in property management, and generally requires a minimum DSCR of 130 percent and a maximum LTV of 65 percent. In addition, the origination of CRE loans typically requires a security interest in the fixtures, equipment, and other personal property of the borrower and/or an assignment of the rents and/or leases. In addition, our CRE loans may contain an interest-only period which typically does not exceed three years; however, these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis. 

The following table presents a geographical analysis of the CRE loans in our held-for-investment loan portfolio: 

At June 30, 2023 Commercial Real Estate Loans (dollars in millions) Amount Percent of Total New York $ 4,884 46 % Michigan 1,186 11 % New Jersey 654 6 % Florida 543 5 % Texas 337 3 % Pennsylvania 324 3 % Ohio 237 2 % All other states 2,448 24 % Total $ 10,613 100 % 

Acquisition, Development, and Construction Loans 

At June 30, 2023, our ADC loans represented $2.5 billion or 3.0 percent, of total loans held for investment, reflecting an increase of $485 million compared to December 31, 2022. 

Because ADC loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk, especially during a downturn in the credit cycle, borrowers are required to provide a guarantee of repayment and completion. The risk of loss on an ADC loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial appraisal of the property&#8217;s value upon completion of construction; the developer&#8217;s experience; the estimated cost of construction, including interest; and the estimated time to complete and/or sell or lease such property. 

When applicable, as a condition to closing an ADC loan, it is our practice to require that properties meet pre-sale or pre-lease requirements prior to funding. 

C&#38;I Loans 

At June 30, 2023 C&#38;I loans totaled $23.9 billion or 28.7 percent of total loans held-for-investment. Included in this portfolio is $6.0 billion in warehouse loans that allow mortgage lenders to fund the closing of residential mortgage loans. 

The non-warehouse C&#38;I loans we produce are primarily made to small and mid-size businesses and finance companies. Such loans are tailored to meet the specific needs of our borrowers, and include term loans, demand loans, revolving lines of credit, and, to a much lesser extent, loans that are partly guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. 

A broad range of C&#38;I loans, both collateralized and unsecured, are made available to businesses for working capital (including inventory and accounts receivable), business expansion, the purchase of machinery and equipment, and other general corporate needs. In determining the term and structure of C&#38;I loans, several factors are considered, including the purpose, the collateral, and the anticipated sources of repayment. C&#38;I loans are typically secured by business assets and personal guarantees of the borrower, and include financial covenants to monitor the borrower&#8217;s financial stability. 

Also included in our C&#38;I portfolio is our national warehouse lending platform with relationship managers across the country. We offer warehouse lines of credit to other mortgage lenders which allow the lender to fund the closing of residential mortgage loans. Each extension, advance, or draw-down on the line is fully collateralized by residential mortgage loans and is paid off when the lender sells the loan to an outside investor or, in some instances, to the Bank. 

Underlying mortgage loans are predominantly originated using the Agencies' underwriting standards. The guideline for debt to tangible net worth is 15 to 1. We have $6.0 billion outstanding warehouse loans to other mortgage lenders and have relationships in place to lend up to $11.6 billion at our discretion. 

The interest rates on our C&#38;I loans can be fixed or floating, with floating-rate loans being tied to SOFR, prime or some other market index, plus an applicable spread. Our floating-rate loans may or may not feature a floor rate of interest. The decision to require a floor on C&#38;I loans depends on the level of competition we face for such loans from other institutions, the direction of market interest rates, and the profitability of our relationship with the borrower. 

Specialty Finance 

At June 30, 2023, specialty finance loans and leases totaled $4.8 billion or 6 percent of total loans held for investment, up $393 million or 9 percent compared to December 31, 2022. 

We produce our specialty finance loans and leases through a subsidiary that is staffed by a group of industry veterans with expertise in originating and underwriting senior securitized debt and equipment loans and leases. The subsidiary participates in syndicated loans that are brought to them, and equipment loans and leases that are assigned to them, by a select group of nationally recognized sources, and are generally made to large corporate obligors, many of which are publicly traded, carry investment grade or near-investment grade ratings, and participate in stable industries nationwide. 

The specialty finance loans and leases we fund fall into three categories: asset-based lending, dealer floor-plan lending, and equipment loan and lease financing. Each of these credits is secured with a perfected first security interest in, or outright ownership of, the underlying collateral, and structured as senior debt or as a non-cancelable lea se. As of June 30, 2023, 81 percent of specialty finance loan commitments are structured as floating rate obligations which will benefit in a rising rate environment. 

In the second quarter of 2023, the Company originated $1.9 billion of specialty finance loans and leases, representing 38 percent of total originations compared to $1.9 billion for the same period in 2022, representing 36 percent of total originations. 

Since launching our specialty finance business in the third quarter of 2013, no losses have been recorded on any of the loans or leases in this portfolio. 

One-to-Four Family Loans 

At June 30, 2023, one-to-four family loans represented $5.9 billion, including $947 million of LGG or 7.1 percent, of total loans held for investment. As of June 30, 2023, the repurchase liability on LGG loans was $333 million. As of December 31, 2022 one-to-four family loans totaled $5.8 billion. These loans include various types of conforming and non-conforming fixed and adjustable rate loans underwritten using Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing owner occupied and second home properties. We typically hold certain mortgage loans in LHFI that do not qualify for sale to the Agencies and that have an acceptable yield and risk profile. The LTV requirements on our residential first mortgage loans vary depending on occupancy, property type, loan amount, and FICO scores. Loans with LTVs exceedi ng 80 percent are required to obtain mortgage insurance. As of June 30, 2023, non-government guaranteed loans in this portfolio had an average current FICO score of 741 and an average LTV of 54. 

Substantially all LGG are insured or guaranteed by the FHA or the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Nonperforming repurchased loans in this portfolio earn interest at a rate based upon the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rate from the time the underlying loan becomes 60 days delinquent until the loan is conveyed to HUD (if foreclosure timelines are met), which is not paid by the FHA until claimed. The Bank has a unilateral option to repurchase loans sold to GNMA if the loan is due, but unpaid, for three consecutive months (typically referred to as 90 days past due) and can recover losses through a claims process from the guarantor. These loans are recorded in loans held for investment and the liability to repurchase the loans is recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Certain loans within our portfolio may be subject to indemnifications and insurance limits which expose us to limited credit risk. We have reserved for these risks within other assets and as a component of our ACL on residential first mortgages. 

Other Loans 

At June 30, 2023, other loans totaled $2.6 billion and consisted primarily of home equity lines of credit, boat and recreational vehicle indirect lending, point of sale consumer loans and other consumer loans, including overdraft loans. 

Our home equity portfolio includes HELOANs, second mortgage loans, and HELOCs. These loans are underwritten and priced in an effort to ensure credit quality and loan profitability. Our debt-to-income ratio on HELOANs and HELOCs is capped at 43 percent and 45 percent, respectively. We currently limit the maximum CLTV to 89.99 percent and FICO scores to a minimum of 700. Second mortgage loans and HELOANs are fixed rate loans and are available with terms up to 20 years. HELOC loans are primarily variable-rate loans that contain a 10-year interest only draw period followed by a 20-year amortizing period. As of June 30, 2023, loans in this portfolio had an average current FICO score of 751. 

As of June 30, 2023, loans in our indirect portfolio had an average current FICO score of 747. Point of sale loans consist of unsecured consumer installment loans originated primarily for home improvement purposes through a third-party financial technology company who also provides us a level of credit loss protection. 

&#160; 

Loans Held for Sale 

Loans held-for-sale at June 30, 2023 totaled $2.2 billion, up from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2022. The Signature Transaction contributed $360 million of Small Business Administration ("SBA") loans to this increase. We classify loans as held for sale when we originate or purchase loans that we intend to sell. We have elected the fair value option for nearly all of this portfolio, except the SBA loans. We estimate the fair value of mortgage loans based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans, where available, or by discounting estimated cash flows using observable inputs inclusive of interest rates, prepayment speeds and loss assumptions for similar collateral. 

Lending Authority 

We maintain credit limits in compliance with regulatory requirements. Under regulatory guidance, the Bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15 percent of Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital and any portion of the ACL not included in Tier 2 capital. We have a tracking and reporting process to monitor lending concentration levels, and all new commercial real estate credit exposures to relationships that exceed $200 million and all other commercial credit exposures to relationships that exceed $100 million must be approved by the Board Credit Committee of the Board. Exceptions to these levels are made to strong borrowers on a case by case basis, with the approval of the Board Credit Committee of the Board. Relationships less than the aforementioned limits are approved by the joint authority of credit officers and lending officers. The Board Credit Committee has authority to direct changes in lending practices as they deem necessary or appropriate in order to address individual or aggregate risks and credit exposures in accordance with the Bank&#8217;s strategic objectives and risk appetites. 

At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the largest mortgage loan in our portfolio was a $329 million multi-family loan, which is collateralized by properties located in Brooklyn, New York. As of the date of this report, the loan has been current since origination. 

Asset Quality 

All asset quality information excludes LGG that are insured by U.S government agencies. 

The following table presents the Company's asset quality measures at the respective dates:

Delinquent and non-performing loans held for investment and Repossessed Assets 

The following table presents our loans, 30 to 89 days past due by loan type and the changes in the respective balances: 

June 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 (dollars in millions) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Amount Percent Loans 30 to 89 Days Past Due: Multi-family $ 79 $ 34 $ 45 132 % Commercial real estate 147 2 145 NM One-to-four family first mortgage 17 21 (4) (19) % Acquisition, development, and construction 29 &#8212; 29 NM Commercial and industrial 45 &#8212; 45 NM Other loans 18 13 5 38 % Total loans 30-89 days past due $ 335 $ 70 265 379 % 

A loan generally is classified as a &#8220;non-accrual&#8221; loan when it is 90 days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because we no longer expect to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, we cease the accrual of interest owed, and previously accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, all of our non-performing loans were non-accrual loans. A loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is current and we have reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible. 

We monitor non-accrual loans both within and beyond our primary lending area in the same manner. Monitoring loans generally involves inspecting and re-appraising the collateral properties; holding discussions with the principals and managing agents of the borrowing entities and retain legal counsel, as applicable; requesting financial, operating, and rent roll information; confirming that hazard insurance is in place or force-placing such insurance; monitoring tax payment status. advancing funds as needed; and seeking approval from the courts to appoint a receiver, when necessary to protect the Bank&#8217;s interests, including to collect rents, manage property operations, and ensure maintenance of the collateral properties. 

It is our policy to order updated appraisals for all non-performing loans 90 days or more past due, irrespective of loan type, that are collateralized by multi-family buildings, CRE properties, or land, if the most recent appraisal on file for the property is more than one year old. Appraisals are ordered annually until such time as the loan becomes performing and is returned to accrual status. It is not our policy to obtain updated appraisals for performing loans. However, appraisals may be ordered for performing loans when a borrower requests an increase in the loan amount, a modification in loan terms, or an extension of a maturing loan. 

The following table presents our non-performing loans by loan type and the changes in the respective balances:

$ 233 

At June 30, 2023 total non-accrual mortgage loans increased $29 million to $154 million, while other non-accrual loans increased $63 million to $79 million compared December 31, 2022. Included in the June 30, 2023 amount were non-accrual loans of $44 million acquired in the Signature Transaction. 

At June 30, 2023, NPAs to total assets equaled 0.21 percent compared to 0.14 percent at March 31, 2023 while NPLs to total loans equaled 0.28 percent compared to 0.20 percent at December 31, 2022. Repossessed assets of $13 million were relatively unchanged compared to the $13 million recorded in the prior quarter. 

Non-performing loans are reviewed regularly by management and discussed on a monthly basis with the Board Credit Committee, and the Board of Directors of the Bank, as applicable. In accordance with our charge-off policy, collateral-dependent non-performing loans are written down to their current appraised values, less certain transaction costs. Workout specialists from our Loan Workout Unit actively pursue borrowers who are delinquent in repaying their loans in an effort to collect payment. In addition, outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to institute such action with regard to such borrowers. 

Properties and other assets that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets, and are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, less the estimated cost of selling the property. Subsequent declines in the fair value of the assets are charged to earnings and are included in non-interest expense. It is our policy to require an appraisal and an environmental assessment of properties classified as OREO before foreclosure, and to re-appraise the properties on an as-needed basis, and not less than annually, until they are sold. We dispose of such properties as quickly and prudently as possible, given current market conditions and the property&#8217;s condition. 

To mitigate the potential for credit losses, we underwrite our loans in accordance with credit standards that we consider to be prudent. In the case of multi-family and CRE loans, we look first at the consistency of the cash flows being generated by the property to determine its economic value using the &#8220;income approach,&#8221; and then at the market value of the property that collateralizes the loan. The amount of the loan is then based on the lower of the two values, with the economic value more typically used. 

The condition of the collateral property is another critical factor. Multi-family buildings and CRE properties are inspected from rooftop to basement as a prerequisite to approval. Furthermore, independent appraisers, whose appraisals are carefully reviewed by our experienced in-house appraisal officers and staff, perform appraisals on collateral properties. 

In addition, we work with a select group of mortgage brokers who are familiar with our credit standards and whose track record with our lending officers is typically greater than ten years. Furthermore, in New York City, where the majority of the buildings securing our multi-family loans are located, the rents that tenants may be charged on certain apartments are typically restricted under certain rent-control or rent-stabilization laws. As a result, the rents that tenants pay for such apartments are generally lower than current market rents. Buildings with a preponderance of such rent-regulated apartments are less likely to experience vacancies in times of economic adversity. 

Reflecting the strength of the underlying collateral for these loans and the collateral structure, a relatively small percentage of our non-performing multi-family loans have resulted in losses over time. 

To further manage our credit risk, our lending policies limit the amount of credit granted to any one borrower, and typically require minimum DSCRs of 120 percent for multi-family loans and 130 percent for CRE loans. Although we typically lend up to 75 percent of the appraised value on multi-family buildings and up to 65 percent on commercial properties, the average LTVs of such credits at origination were below those amounts at June 30, 2023. Exceptions to these LTV limitations are minimal and are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 

The repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties. To minimize our credit risk, we originate CRE loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards, and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the property&#8217;s current income stream and DSCR. The approval of a CRE loan also depends on the borrower&#8217;s credit history, profitability, and expertise in property management. Given that our CRE loans are underwritten in accordance with underwriting standards that are similar to those applicable to our multi-family credits, the percentage of our non-performing CRE loans that have resulted in losses has been comparatively small over time. 

Multi-family and CRE loans are generally originated at conservative LTVs and DSCRs, as previously stated. Low LTVs provide a greater likelihood of full recovery and reduce the possibility of incurring a severe loss on a credit; in many cases, they reduce the likelihood of the borrower &#8220;walking away&#8221; from the property. Although borrowers may default on loan payments, they have a greater incentive to protect their equity in the collateral property and to return their loans to performing status. 

With regard to ADC loans, we typically lend up to 75 percent of the estimated as-completed market value of multi-family and residential tract projects; however, in the case of home construction loans to individuals, the limit is 80 percent. With respect to commercial construction loans, we typically lend up to 65 percent of the estimated as-completed market value of the property. Credit risk is also managed through the loan disbursement process. Loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses, and as warranted by inspection reports provided to us by our own lending officers and/or consulting engineers. 

To minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing, each of our credits is secured with a perfected first security interest or outright ownership in the underlying collateral, and structured as senior debt or as a non-cancellable lease. To further minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing, we re-underwrite each transaction. In addition, we retain outside counsel to conduct a further review of the underlying documentation. 

Other C&#38;I loans generally represent loans to commercial businesses which meet certain desired client characteristics and credit standards. The credit standards for commercial borrowers are based on numerous criteria, including historical and projected financial information, strength of management, acceptable collateral, and market conditions and trends in the borrower&#8217;s industry. These loans are generally variable rate loans in which the interest rate fluctuates with a specified index rate. 

The procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories, with late charges assessed, and notices mailed to the borrower, at specified dates. We attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment. When contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property, we attempt to obtain full payment, and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action. Delinquencies are addressed by our Loan Workout Unit and every effort is made to collect rather than initiate foreclosure proceedings. 

Fair values for all multi-family buildings, CRE properties, and land are determined based on the appraised value. If an appraisal is more than one year old and the loan is classified as either non-performing or as an accruing TDM, then an updated appraisal is required to determine fair value. Estimated disposition costs are deducted from the fair value of the property to determine estimated net realizable value. In the instance of an outdated appraisal on an impaired loan, we adjust the original appraisal by using a third-party index value to determine the extent of impairment until an updated appraisal is received. 

While we strive to originate loans that will perform fully, adverse economic and market conditions, among other factors, can negatively impact a borrower&#8217;s ability to repay. Historically, our level of net charge-offs in our multifamily and specialty finance portfolios have been relatively low in downward credit cycles, even when the volume of non-performing loans has increased. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, our net recoveries were $1 million as c ompared to net recoveries of $5 million over the same period in 2022. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases increased $201 million, equaling $594 million at June 30, 2023 from $393 million at December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily related to the initial allowance for credit losses of $132 million for the acquired loans in the Signature Transaction, an increase of $13 million in specific reserves primarily related to two loans that have moved to nonaccrual and an increase of $56 million primarily related to our worsening forecast of macroeconomic conditions and origination volume since year-end. The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases represented 255 percent of non-performing loans at June 30, 2023, as compared to 279 percent at the prior year-end. 

Based upon all relevant and available information at June 30, 2023, management believes that the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases represents a reasonable estimate based upon our judgment as that date. 

The following table presents information on the Company's net charge-offs as compared to average loans outstanding: 

Six Months Ended, (dollars in millions) June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Multi-family Net charge-offs (recoveries) during the period $ &#8212; $ &#8212; Average amount outstanding $ 37,819 $ 35,332 Net charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of average loans &#8212; % &#8212; % Commercial real estate Net charge-offs (recoveries) during the period $ &#8212; $ &#8212; Average amount outstanding $ 9,619 $ 6,669 Net charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of average loans &#8212; % &#8212; % One-to-Four Family first mortgage Net charge-offs (recoveries) during the period $ 3 $ &#8212; Average amount outstanding $ 5,881 $ 146 Net charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of average loans &#8212; % &#8212; % Acquisition, Development and Construction Net charge-offs (recoveries) during the period $ &#8212; $ &#8212; Average amount outstanding $ 2,219 $ 228 Net charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of average loans &#8212; % &#8212; % Other Loans Net charge-offs (recoveries) during the period $ (4) $ (5) Average amount outstanding $ 21,943 $ 4,104 Net charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of average loans (0.02) % (0.12) % Total loans Net charge-offs (recoveries) during the period $ (1) $ (5) Average amount outstanding $ 77,481 $ 46,479 Net charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of average loans &#8212; % -0.01 % 

Securities 

Total securities were $7.8 billion, or 7 percent, of total assets at June 30, 2023, compared to $9.1 billion, or 10 percent of total assets at December 31, 2022 . At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, all of our securities were designated as &#8220;Available-for-Sale&#8221;. At June 30, 2023, 15 percent of our portfolio are floating rate securities. 

As of June 30, 2023, the net unrealized loss on securities available for sale, net of tax, was $668 million as compared to $626 million at December 31, 2022, reflecting the rising interest rate environment. 

At June 30, 2023, available-for-sale securities had an estimated weighted average life of seven years. Included in the quarter-end amount were mortgage-related securities of $5.0 billion and other debt securities of $2.8 billion. 

At the prior year-end, available-for-sale securities were $9.1 billion, and had an estimated weighted average life of six years. Mortgage-related securities accounted for $4.8 billion of the year-end balance, with other debt securities accounting for the remaining $4.3 billion. 

The following table summarizes the weighted average yields of debt securities for the maturities indicated at June 30, 2023:

Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank Stock 

At June 30, 2023 the Company had $605 million and $329 million of FHLB-NY stock, at cost, and FHLB-Indianapolis stock, at cost, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the Company had $762 million and $329 million of FHLB-NY stock, at cost and FHLB-Indianapolis stock, at cost, respectively. The Company maintains an investment in FHLB-NY stock and, as a result of the Flagstar acquisition, FHLB-Indianapolis stock, partly in conjunction with its membership in the FHLB and partly related to its access to the FHLB funding it utilizes. In addition, the Company had Federal Reserve Bank stock, at cost, of $203 million and $176 million at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Bank-Owned Life Insurance 

BOLI is recorded at the total cash surrender value of the policies in the Consolidated Statements of Condition, and the income generated by the increase in the cash surrender value of the policies is recorded in &#8220;Non-interest income&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Reflecting an increase in the cash surrender value of the underlying policies, our investment in BOLI at June 30, 2023 rose $6 million to $1.6 billion compared to December 31, 2022. 

Goodwill 

We record goodwill in our consolidated statements of condition in connection with certain of our business combinations. Goodwill, which is tested at least annually for impairment, refers to the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of an acquired company&#8217;s assets, net of the liabilities assumed. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 goodwill was $2.4 billion. 

Sources of Funds 

The Parent Company has four primary funding sources for the payment of dividends, share repurchases, and other corporate uses: dividends paid to the Parent Company by the Bank; capital raised through the issuance of securities; funding raised through the issuance of debt instruments; and repayments of, and income from, investment securities. 

On a consolidated basis, our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources: retail, institutional, and brokered deposits; borrowed funds, primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings; cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans; and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities. 

Deposits 

Our ability to retain and attract deposits depends on numerous factors, including customer satisfaction, the rates of interest we pay, the types of products we offer, and the attractiveness of their terms. From time to time, we have chosen not to compete actively for deposits, depending on our access to deposits through acquisitions, the availability of lower-cost funding sources, the impact of competition on pricing, and the need to fund our loan demand. The vast majority of our deposits are retail in nature (i.e., they are deposits we have gathered through our branches or through business combinations). 

Depending on their availability and pricing relative to other funding sources, we also include brokered deposits in our deposit mix. Brokered deposits accounted for $9.3 billion of our deposits at June 30, 2023, compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2022. Brokered money market accounts represented $2.2 billion of total brokered deposits at June 30, 2023 and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2022; brokered interest-bearing checking accounts represented $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. At June 30, 2023, we had $6.0 billion of brokered CDs , compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2022. 

Our uninsured deposits are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit (currently $250,000). These amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes and excludes internal accounts. At June 30, 2023 our deposit base includes $37.8 billion of uninsured deposits a net increase of $18.2 billion as compared to December 31, 2022 due to the Signature Transaction. This represents 43 percent of our total deposits. We also have $37.7 billion of total ready liquidity (cash and cash equivalents, unpledged securities, Fed Funds access and FHLB borrowing capacity). Our total ready liquidity approximately matches the balance of our uninsured deposits. 

The following table indicates the amount of time deposits, by account, that are in excess of the FDIC insurance limit (currently $250,000) by time remaining until maturity: 

(in millions) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Portion of U.S. time deposits in excess of insurance limit $ 4,847 $ 3,749 Time deposits otherwise uninsured with a maturity of: 3 months or less 1,601 969 Over 3 months through 6 months 1,239 604 Over 6 months through 12 months 1,260 1,269 Over 12 months 747 907 Total time deposits otherwise uninsured $ 4,847 $ 3,749 

Borrowed Funds 

The majority of our borrowed funds are wholesale borrowings (FHLB-NY and FHLB-Indianapolis advances) and, to a lesser extent, junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes. At June 30, 2023, total borrowed funds decreased $4.9 billion to $16.4 billion compared to the balance at December 31, 2022 primarily driven by the paydown of wholesale borrowings with cash received in the Signature Transaction. 

Wholesale Borrowings 

Wholesale borrowings at June 30, 2023 were $15.4 billion compared to $20.3 billion at December 31, 2022. 

FHLB-NY and FHLB-Indianapolis advances accounted for $15.4 billion and $20.3 billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Pursuant to blanket collateral agreements with the Bank, our FHLB-NY, FHLB-Indianapolis advances and overnight advances are secured by pledges of certain eligible collateral in the form of loans and securities. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $5.4 billion and $6.8 billion of our wholesale borrowings had callable features, respectively. 

We had no federal funds outstanding at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Junior Subordinated Debentures 

Junior subordinated debentures totaled $577 million at June 30, 2023 compared to $575 million at December 31, 2022. 

Subordinated Notes 

At June 30, 2023, the balance of subordinated notes was $435 million, including $135 million assumed from the Flagstar acquisition. 

See Note 11, &#8220;Borrowed Funds,&#8221; in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for a further discussion of our wholesale borrowings, our junior subordinated debentures and subordinated debt. 

Liquidity, Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Commitments, and Capital Position 

Liquidity 

We manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations, and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand. 

We monitor our liquidity daily to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet our financial obligations. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $15.8 billion and $2.0 billion, at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The $13.8 billion increase in cash and cash equivalents includes custodial deposits related to the Signature Transaction. 

Our $37.7 billion of total ready liquidity (cash and cash equivalents, unpledged securities, and FHLB borrowing capacity), approximately matching the balance of our uninsured deposits. 

Additional liquidity stems from deposits and from our use of wholesale funding sources, including wholesale borrowings and brokered deposits. In addition, we have access to the Bank&#8217;s approved lines of credit with various counterparties, including the FHLB-NY. The availability of these wholesale funding sources is generally based on the amount of mortgage loan collateral available under a blanket lien we have pledged to the respective institutions and, to a lesser extent, the amount of available securities that may be pledged to collateralize our borrowings. At June 30, 2023 our available borrowing capacity with the FHLB-NY was $15.4 billion. I n addition, the Bank had available-for-sale securities of $7.8 billion , of which, $6.5 billion is unpledged. 

Furthermore, the Bank has agreements with the FRB-NY that enable it to access the discount window as a further means of enhancing our liquidity. In connecti on with these agreements, the Bank has pledged certain loans and securities to collateralize any funds we may borrow. The maximum amount the Bank could borrow from the FRB-NY was $1.0 billion . There were no borrowings against these lines of credit at June 30, 2023. 

CDs due to mature or reprice in one year or less from June 30, 2023 totaled $16.9 billion, representing 93 percent of total CDs at that date. Our ability to attract and retain retail deposits, including CDs, depends on numerous factors, including, among others, the convenience of our branches and our other banking channels; our customers&#8217; satisfaction with the service they receive; the rates of interest we offer; the types of products we feature; and the attractiveness of their terms. 

Our decision to compete for deposits also depends on numerous factors, including, among others, our access to deposits through acquisitions, the availability of lower-cost funding sources, the impact of competition on pricing, and the need to fund our loan demand. 

The Parent Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. At June 30, 2023 the Parent Company held cash and cash equivalents of $131 million. In addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases, the Parent Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to our stockholders. As a Delaware corporation, the Parent Company is able to pay dividends either from surplus or, in case there is no surplus, from net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. 

Various legal restrictions limit the extent to which the Company&#8217;s subsidiary bank can supply funds to the Parent Company and its non-bank subsidiaries. The Bank would require the approval of the OCC if the dividends it declares in any calendar year were to exceed the total of its respective net profits for that year combined with its respective retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfer to paid-in capital. The term &#8220;net profits&#8221; is defined as net income for a given period less any dividends paid during that period. As a result of our acquisition of Flagstar, we are also 

required to seek regulatory approval from the OCC for the payment of any dividend to the Parent Company through at least the period ending November 1, 2024. In connection with receiving regulatory approval from the OCC for the Signature Transaction, the Bank has committed that (i) for a period of two years from the date of the Signature Transaction, it will not declare or pay any dividend without receiving a prior written determination of no supervisory objection from the OCC and (ii) it will not declare or pay dividends on the amount of retained earnings that represents any net bargain purchase gain that is subject to a conditional period that may be imposed by the OCC. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, dividends of $280 million were paid by the Bank to the Parent Company. At June 30, 2023, the Bank had $479 million available for additional dividends, excluding bargain purchase gain from retained earnings. 

At June 30, 2023, we believe the Company has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 

In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of contractual obligations in order to manage our assets and liabilities, fund loan growth, operate our branch network, and address our capital needs. 

For example, we offer CDs with contractual terms to our customers, and borrow funds under contract from the FHLB-NY. These contractual obligations are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Condition under &#8220;Deposits&#8221; and &#8220;Borrowed funds,&#8221; respectively. At June 30, 2023, we had CDs of $18.2 billion and long-term debt (defined as borrowed funds with an original maturity one year or more) of $10.9 billion. 

We also are obligated under certain non-cancelable operating leases on the buildings and land we use in operating our branch network and in performing our back-office responsibilities. These obligations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Condition and totaled $536 million at June 30, 2023 an increase of $414 million compared to $122 million at December 31, 2022 driven by the Signature Transaction. 

At June 30, 2023, we also had commitments to extend credit in the form of mortgage and other loan originations, as well as commercial, performance stand-by, and financial stand-by letters of credit. These commitments consist of agreements to extend credit, as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract under which the loan is made. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. 

The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s commitments to originate loans and letters of credit: 

(in millions) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Multi-family and commercial real estate $ 96 $ 216 One-to-four family including interest rate locks 2,497 2,066 Acquisition, development, and construction 4,281 3,539 Warehouse loan commitments 5,479 8,042 Other loan commitments 11,484 7,964 Total loan commitments $ 23,837 $ 21,827 Commercial, performance stand-by, and financial stand-by letters of credit 941 541 Total commitments $ 24,778 $ 22,368 

The letters of credit we issue consist of performance stand-by, financial stand-by, and commercial letters of credit. Financial stand-by letters of credit primarily are issued for the benefit of other financial institutions, municipalities, or landlords on behalf of certain of our current borrowers, and obligate us to guarantee payment of a specified financial obligation. Performance stand-by letters of credit are primarily issued for the benefit of local municipalities on behalf of certain of our borrowers. Performance letters of credit obligate us to make payments in the event that a specified third party fails to perform under non-financial contractual obligations. Commercial letters of credit act as a means of ensuring payment to a seller upon shipment of goods to a buyer. Although commercial letters of credit are used to effect payment for domestic transactions, the majority are used to settle payments in international trade. Typically, such letters of credit require the presentation of documents that describe the commercial transaction, and provide evidence of shipment and the transfer of title. The fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in &#8220;Fee income&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 

Based upon our current liquidity position, and ready liquidity of $37.7 billion, we expect that our funding will be sufficient to fulfill these cash obligations and commitments when they are due both in the short term and long term. 

For the three months ended June 30, 2023, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions that we expect to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

At June 30, 2023, we had no commitments to purchase securities. 

Regulatory Capital 

The Bank is subject to regulation, examination, and supervision by the OCC and the Federal Reserve (the &#8220;Regulators&#8221;). The Bank is also governed by numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, which established five categories of capital adequacy ranging from &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; to &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; Such classifications are used by the FDIC to determine various matters, including prompt corrective action and each institution&#8217;s FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to the Regulators&#8217; qualitative judgments about the components of capital and risk weightings, among other factors. 

The quantitative measures established to ensure capital adequacy require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of leverage capital to average assets and of common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital, and total capital to risk-weighted assets (as such measures are defined in the regulations). At June 30, 2023, our capital measures continued to exceed the minimum federal requirements for a bank holding company and for a bank. The following table sets forth our common equity tier 1, tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based, and leverage capital amounts and ratios on a consolidated basis and for the Bank on a stand-alone basis, as well as the respective minimum regulatory capital requirements, at that date: 

The following tables present the actual capital amounts and ratios for the Company: 

Risk-Based Capital June 30, 2023 Common Equity Tier 1 Tier 1 Total Leverage Capital (dollars in millions) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Total capital $ 8,269 9.59 % $ 8,772 10.17 % $ 10,304 11.95 % $ 8,772 7.37 % Minimum for capital adequacy purposes 3,881 4.50 5,175 6.00 6,900 8.00 4,762 4.00 Excess $ 4,388 5.09 % $ 3,597 4.17 % $ 3,404 3.95 % $ 4,010 3.37 % December 31, 2022 Total capital $ 6,335 9.06 % $ 6,838 9.78 % $ 8,154 11.66 % $ 6,838 9.70 % Minimum for capital adequacy purposes 3,146 4.50 4,195 6.00 5,593 8.00 2,819 4.00 Excess $ 3,189 4.56 % $ 2,643 3.78 % $ 2,561 3.66 % $ 4,019 5.70 % 

The following tables present the actual capital amounts and ratios for the Bank:

At June 30, 2023, our total risk-based capital ratio exceeded the minimum requirement for capital adequacy purposes by 395 basis points and the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer by 145 basis points. 

The Bank also exceeded the minimum capital requirements to be categorized as &#8220;Well Capitalized.&#8221; To be categorized as well capitalized, a bank must maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 ratio of 6.50 percent; a minimum tier 1 risk-based 

capital ratio of 8 percent; a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 10 percent; and a minimum leverage capital ratio of 5 percent. 

RECONCILIATIONS OF SHAREHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY, COMMON STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY, AND TANGIBLE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY; TOTAL ASSETS AND TANGIBLE ASSETS; AND THE RELATED MEASURES 

While stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, total assets, and book value per common share are financial measures that are recorded in accordance with U.S. GAAP, tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity, tangible assets, and tangible book value per common share are not. It is management&#8217;s belief that these non-GAAP measures should be disclosed in this report and others we issue for the following reasons: 

1. Tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity is an important indication of the Company&#8217;s ability to grow organically and through business combinations, as well as its ability to pay dividends and to engage in various capital management strategies. 

2. Tangible book value per common share and the ratio of tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity to tangible assets are among the capital measures considered by current and prospective investors, both independent of, and in comparison with, the Company&#8217;s peers. 

Tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity, tangible assets, and the related non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, total assets, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate these non-GAAP measures may differ from that of other companies reporting non-GAAP measures with similar names. 

Reconciliations of our stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, and tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity; our total assets and tangible assets; and the related financial measures for the respective periods follow:

Market Risk 

As a financial institution, we are focused on reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility, which represents our primary market risk. Changes in market interest rates represent the greatest challenge to our financial performance, as such changes can have a significant impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and on the market value of all interest-earning assets, other than those possessing a short term to maturity. To reduce our exposure to changing rates, the Board of Directors and management monitor interest rate sensitivity on a regular or as needed basis so that adjustments to the asset and liability mix can be made when deemed appropriate. 

The actual duration of held-for-investment mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities can be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment levels and market interest rates. The level of prepayments may, in turn, be impacted by a variety of factors, including the economy in the region where the underlying mortgages were originated; seasonal factors; demographic 

variables; and the assumability of the underlying mortgages. However, the factors with the most significant impact on prepayments are market interest rates and the availability of refinancing opportunities. 

We managed our interest rate risk by taking the following actions: (1) We have continued to emphasize the origination and retention of intermediate-term assets, primarily in the form of multi-family and CRE loans; (2) We have continued the origination of certain C&#38;I loans that feature floating interest rates; (3) Increased the focus on retaining low costs deposits; and (4) Obtained new low cost deposits as part of the banking-as-a-service initiative (5) The use of derivatives to manage our interest rate position. 

Uninsured Deposits 

We manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations, and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand. As a result, we have $37.7 billion of total ready liquidity (cash and cash equivalents, unpledged securities, Fed Funds access and FHLB borrowing capacity), approximately matching the balance of our uninsured deposits. Our uninsured deposits are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit (currently $250,000). These amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes and excludes internal accounts. At June 30, 2023 our deposit base includes $37.8 billion of uninsured deposits, reflecting a net increase of $18.2 billion as compared to December 31, 2022 due to the Signature Transaction. This represents 43 percent of our total deposits. 

LIBOR Transition Process and Phase Out 

The Company has certain loans, interest rate swap agreements, investment securities, and debt obligations whose interest rate is indexed to LIBOR. In 2017, the FCA, which is responsible for regulating LIBOR, announced that the publication of LIBOR is not guaranteed beyond 2021. In December 2020, the administrator of LIBOR announced its intention to (i) cease the publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR after December 31, 2021, and (ii) cease the publication of all other tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (one, three, six, and 12-month LIBOR) after June 30, 2023, and on March 15, 2021, announced that it will permanently cease to publish most LIBOR settings beginning on January 1, 2022 and cease to publish the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and 12-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on July 1, 2023. Accordingly, the FCA has stated that it does not intend to persuade or compel banks to submit to LIBOR after such respective dates. Until such time, however, FCA panel banks have agreed to continue to support LIBOR. In October 2021, the Federal bank regulatory agencies issued a Joint Statement on Managing the LIBOR Transition that offered their regulatory expectations and outlined potential supervisory and enforcement consequences for banks that fail to adequately plan for and implement the transition away from LIBOR. The failure to properly transition away from LIBOR may result in increased supervisory scrutiny. The implementation of a substitute index for the calculation of interest rates under the Company's loan agreements may result in disputes or litigation with counterparties over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index, which would have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. Even when robust fallback language is included, there can be no assurances that the replacement rate plus any spread adjustment will be economically equivalent to LIBOR, which could result in a lower interest rate being paid to the Company on such assets. 

The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (a group of private-market participants convened by the FRB and the FRB-NY) has identified SOFR as the recommended alternative to LIBOR. The use of SOFR as a substitute for LIBOR is voluntary and may not be suitable for all market participants. SOFR is calculated and observed differently than LIBOR. Given the manner in which SOFR is calculated, it is likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. Market practices related to SOFR calculation conventions continue to develop and may vary. Inconsistent calculation conventions among financial products may expose is to increased basic rate and resultant costs. 

Other alternatives to LIBOR also exist, but, because of the difference in how those alternatives are constructed, they may diverge significantly from LIBOR in a range of situations and market conditions. 

The Bank established a sub-committee of ALCO to address issues related to the phase out and transition from LIBOR. This sub-committee consists of personnel from various departments through the Bank including lending, loan administration, credit risk management, finance/treasury, including interest rate risk and liquidity management, information technology, and operations. The Company has LIBOR-based contracts that extend beyond June 30, 2023. The sub-committee has monitored the Bank&#8217;s LIBOR transition progress and substantially all contracts have been updated. In complying with industry requirements, the Bank has not offered new LIBOR-based products since December 31, 2021. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis 

Interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in our Economic Value of Equity (EVE) over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The EVE ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the EVE in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The model assumes estimated loan and MBS prepayment rates, current market value spreads, and deposit decay rates and betas. 

Based on the information and assumptions in effect at June 30, 2023, the following table sets forth our EVE, assuming the changes in interest rates noted: 

Change in Interest Rates (in basis points) Estimated Percentage Change in Economic Value of Equity -200 over one year (3.6)% -100 over one year (1.5)% +100 over one year (0.6)% +200 over one year (1.5)% &#160; 

The net changes in EVE presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank. 

Accordingly, while the EVE analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income, and may very well differ from actual results. 

Interest Rate Risk is also monitored through the use of a model that generates Net Interest Income (NII) simulations over a range of interest rate scenarios. Modeling changes in NII requires that certain assumptions be made which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the NII analysis presented below assumes that the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured, and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve, regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Furthermore, the model does not take into account the benefit of any strategic actions we may take to further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk. The assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the following table, due to the frequency, timing, and magnitude of changes in interest rates; changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories; and prepayments, among other factors, coupled with any actions taken to counter the effects of any such changes. 

Based on the information and assumptions in effect at June 30, 2023, the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in future net interest income for the next twelve months, assuming the changes in interest rates noted: 

Change in Interest Rates (in basis points) (1) 

Estimated Percentage Change in Future Net Interest Income -200 over one year (8.9)% -100 over one year (4.9)% +100 over one year 5.0% +200 over one year 10.0% 

(1) In general, short- and long-term rates are assumed to increase in parallel instantaneously and then remain unchanged. 

The net changes in NII presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank. 

Future changes in our mix of assets and liabilities may result in greater changes to our EVE, and/or NII simulations. 

In the event that our EVE and net interest income sensitivities were to breach our internal policy limits, we would undertake the following actions to ensure that appropriate remedial measures were put in place: 

&#8226; In formulating appropriate strategies, the ALCO Committee would ascertain the primary causes of the variance from policy tolerances, the expected term of such conditions, and the projected effect on capital and earnings. 

&#8226; Our ALCO Committee would inform the Board of Directors of the variance, and present recommendations to the Board regarding proposed courses of action to restore conditions to within-policy tolerances. 

Where temporary changes in market conditions or volume levels result in significant increases in risk, strategies may involve reducing open positions or employing other balance sheet management activities including the potential use of derivatives to reduce the risk exposure. Where variance from policy tolerances is triggered by more fundamental imbalances in the risk profiles of core loan and deposit products, a remedial strategy may involve restoring balance through natural hedges to the extent possible before employing synthetic hedging techniques. Other strategies might include: 

&#8226; Asset restructuring, involving sales of assets having higher risk profiles, or a gradual restructuring of the asset mix over time to affect the maturity or repricing schedule of assets; 

&#8226; Liability restructuring, whereby product offerings and pricing are altered or wholesale borrowings are employed to affect the maturity structure or repricing of liabilities; 

&#8226; Expansion or shrinkage of the balance sheet to correct imbalances in the repricing or maturity periods between assets and liabilities; and/or 

&#8226; Use or alteration of off-balance sheet positions, including interest rate swaps, caps, floors, options, and forward purchase or sales commitments. 

In connection with our net interest income simulation modeling, we also evaluate the impact of changes in the slope of the yield curve. At June 30, 2023, our analysis indicated that a further inversion of the yield curve would be expected to result in a 3.8 percent decrease in net interest income; conversely, an immediate steepening of the yield curve would be expected to result in a 1.5 percent increase in net interest income. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Various elements of our accounting policies, by their nature, are subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. Certain accounting policies that, due to the judgment, estimates and assumptions are critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes, are described in Item 1. These policies relate to: (a) the determination of our ACL, (b) fair value measurements and (c) the acquisition method of accounting. We believe the judgment, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time. However, given the sensitivity of our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to these critical accounting policies, the use of other judgments, estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in our results of operations and/or financial condition. 

For further information on our critical accounting policies, please refer to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which is available on our website, under the Investor Relations section, or on the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission, at sec.gov. 

Signature Transaction - Certain Financial Information 

In accordance with the guidance provided in Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 1:K, &#8220;Financial Statements of Acquired Troubled Financial Institutions&#8221; (&#8220;SAB 1:K&#8221;), and a pending request for relief submitted by the Company to the Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance therewith, the Company has omitted certain financial information on the Signature Transaction required by Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X and Article 11 of Regulation S-X. SAB 1:K provides relief from the requirements of Rule 3-05 and Article 11 of Regulation S-X under certain circumstances, including a transaction such as the Signature Transaction, in which the registrant engages in an acquisition of a troubled financial institution for which historical financial statements are not reasonably available or relevant and in which federal assistance is an essential and significant part of the transaction. 

Reportable Segment and Reporting Units 

We operate in a single reportable segment and have identified one reporting unit which is the same as our operating segment. Following the acquisition of Flagstar Bank, N.A. and closing the Signature Transaction, we are currently in the process of reassessing our reportable segments and reporting units, which may result in a change to either or both in future reporting periods.

Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation 

Organization 

New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (on a stand-alone basis, the &#8220;Parent Company&#8221; or, collectively with its subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company&#8221; or "we") was organized under Delaware law on July 20, 1993 and is the holding company for Flagstar Bank N.A. (hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). The Company is headquartered in Hicksville, New York with regional headquarters in Troy, Michigan. 

The Company is subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve. The Bank is a National Association, subject to federal regulation and oversight by the OCC. 

On November 23, 1993, the Company issued its initial offering of common stock (par value: $ 0.01 per share) at a price of $ 25.00 per share ($ 0.93 per share on a split-adjusted basis, reflecting the impact of nine stock splits between 1994 and 2004). The Company has grown organically and through a series of accretive mergers and acquisitions, culminating in its acquisition of Flagstar Bancorp, Inc., which closed on December 1, 2022 and the Signature Transaction which closed on March 20, 2023. 

Flagstar Bank, N.A. currently operates 436 branches across nine states, including strong footholds in the Northeast and Midwest and exposure to markets in the Southeast and West Coast. Flagstar Mortgage operates nationally through a wholesale network of approximately 3000 third-party mortgage originators. Flagstar Bank N.A. also operates through eight local divisions, each with a history of service and strength: Queens County Savings Bank, Roslyn Savings Bank, Richmond County Savings Bank, Roosevelt Savings Bank, and Atlantic Bank in New York; Garden State Community Bank in New Jersey; Ohio Savings Bank in Ohio; and AmTrust Bank in Arizona and Florida. 

Basis of Presentation 

The following is a description of the significant accounting and reporting policies that the Company and its subsidiaries follow in preparing and presenting their consolidated financial statements, which conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates that are used in connection with the determination of the allowance for credit losses, mortgage servicing rights, the Flagstar acquisition and the Signature Transaction. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and other entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Company currently has certain unconsolidated subsidiaries in the form of wholly-owned statutory business trusts, which were formed to issue guaranteed capital securities. See Note 11 &#8220;Borrowed Funds,&#8221; for additional information regarding these trusts. 

Loans 

Effective January 1, 2023, the Corporation adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2022-02, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures" (ASU 2022-02), which eliminated the accounting for troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) while expanding loan modification and vintage disclosure requirements. Under ASU 2022-02, the Corporation assesses all loan modifications to determine whether one is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, regardless of whether the modified loan terms include a concession. Modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be in the form of an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, a term extension, principal forgiveness or a combination thereof (collectively referred to as Troubled Debt Modifications or TDMs). 

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, the Company accounted for certain loan modifications and restructurings as TDRs. In general, a modification or restructuring of a loan constituted a TDR if the Company granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. 

Adoption of New Accounting Standards 

Standard Description Effective Date ASU 2022-02- Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures Issued March 2022 ASU 2022-02 eliminates prior accounting guidance for TDRs, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The standard also requires that an entity disclose current-period gross charge-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases. The Company adopted ASU 2022-02 effective January 1, 2023 using a modified retrospective transition approach for the amendments related to the recognition and measurement of TDRs. The impact of the adoption resulted in an immaterial change to the allowance for credit losses ("ACL"), thus no adjustment to retained earnings was recorded. Disclosures have been updated to reflect information on loan modifications given to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as presented in Note 6. TDR disclosures are presented for comparative periods only and are not required to be updated in current periods. Additionally, the current year vintage disclosure included in Note 6 has been updated to reflect gross charge-offs by year of origination for the three months ended June 30, 2023. ASU 2023-02 Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method Issued: March 2023 Permits reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. The Company adopted ASU 2023-02 effective January 1, 2023 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

Note 2 - Computation of Earnings per Common Share 

Earnings per Common Share (Basic and Diluted) 

Basic EPS is computed by dividing the net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed using the same method as basic EPS, however, the computation reflects the potential dilution that would occur if outstanding in-the-money stock options were exercised and converted into common stock. 

Unvested stock-based compensation awards containing non-forfeitable rights to dividends paid on the Company&#8217;s common stock are considered participating securities, and therefore are included in the two-class method for calculating EPS. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common shares and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends on the common stock. The Company grants restricted stock to certain employees under its stock-based compensation plan. Recipients receive cash dividends during the vesting periods of these awards, including on the unvested portion of such awards. Since these dividends are non-forfeitable, the unvested awards are considered participating securities and therefore have earnings allocated to them. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions, except share and per share amounts) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net income available to common stockholders $ 405 &#160; $ 163 &#160; $ 2,403 &#160; $ 310 &#160; Less: Dividends paid on and earnings allocated to participating securities ( 4 ) ( 2 ) ( 26 ) ( 4 ) Earnings applicable to common stock $ 401 &#160; $ 161 &#160; $ 2,377 &#160; $ 306 &#160; Weighted average common shares outstanding 722,264,568 465,811,096 704,685,721 465,476,526 Basic earnings per common share $ 0.55 &#160; $ 0.34 &#160; $ 3.37 &#160; $ 0.66 &#160; Earnings applicable to common stock $ 401 &#160; $ 161 &#160; $ 2,377 &#160; $ 306 &#160; Weighted average common shares outstanding 722,264,568 465,811,096 704,685,721 465,476,526 Potential dilutive common shares 1,462,426 988,976 1,411,524 899,249 Total shares for diluted earnings per common share computation 723,726,994 &#160; 466,800,072 706,097,245 &#160; 466,375,775 Diluted earnings per common share and common share equivalents $ 0.55 &#160; $ 0.34 &#160; $ 3.37 &#160; $ 0.66 &#160; 

Note 3 - Business Combinations 

Signature Bridge Bank 

On March 20, 2023, the Company&#8217;s wholly owned bank subsidiary, Flagstar Bank N.A. (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), entered into a Purchase and Assumption Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), as receiver (the "FDIC Receiver") of Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. (&#8220;Signature&#8221;) to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Signature (the &#8220;Signature Transaction&#8221;). Headquartered in New York, New York, Signature Bank was a full-service commercial bank that operated 29 branches in New York, seven branches in California, two branches in North Carolina, one branch in Connecticut, and one branch in Nevada. In connection with the Signature Transaction the Bank assumed all of Signature&#8217;s branches. The Bank acquired only certain parts of Signature it believes to be financially and strategically complementary that are intended to enhance the Company&#8217;s future growth. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company was not required to make a cash payment to the FDIC on March 20, 2023 as consideration for the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. As the Company and the FDIC remain engaged in ongoing discussions which may impact the assets and liabilities acquired or assumed by the Company in the Signature Transaction, the Company may be required to make a payment to the FDIC or the FDIC may be required to make a payment to the Company on the Settlement Date, which will be one year after March 20, 2023, or as agreed upon by the FDIC and the Company. 

In addition, as part of the consideration for the Signature Transaction, the Company granted the FDIC equity appreciation rights in the common stock of the Company under an equity appreciation instrument (the "Equity Appreciation Instrument"). On March 31, 2023, the Company issued 39,032,006 shares of Company common stock to the FDIC pursuant to the Equity Appreciation Instrument. On May 19, 2023, the FDIC completed the secondary offering of those shares. 

The Company has determined that the Signature Transaction constitutes a business combination as defined by ASC 805, Business Combinations (" ASC 805"). ASC 805 establishes principles and requirements as to how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded based on their estimated fair values based on initial valuations as of March 20, 2023. 

Under the Agreement, the Company is expected to provide certain services to the FDIC to assist the FDIC in its administration of certain assets and liabilities which were not assumed by the Company and which remain under the control of the FDIC (the &#8220;Interim Servicing&#8221;). The Interim Servicing includes activities related to the servicing of loan portfolios not acquired on behalf of the FDIC for a period of up to one year from the date of the Signature Transaction unless such loans are sold or transferred at an earlier time by the FDIC or until cancelled by the FDIC upon 60-days&#8217; notice. The Interim Servicing may include other ancillary services requested by the FDIC to assist in their administration of the remaining assets and liabilities of Signature Bank. The FDIC will reimburse the Company for costs associated with the Interim Servicing based upon an agreed upon fee which approximates the cost to provide such services. As the FDIC intends to reimburse the Company for 

the costs to service the loans, neither a servicing asset nor servicing liability was recognized as part of the Signature Transaction. 

The Company did not enter into a loss sharing arrangement with the FDIC in connection with the Signature Transaction. 

As the Company finalizes its analysis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, there may be adjustments to the recorded carrying values. In many cases, the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed required management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and subject to change. While the Company believes that the information available on June 30, 2023, provided a reasonable basis for estimating fair value, the Company may obtain additional information and evidence during the measurement period that may result in changes to the estimated fair value amounts. Fair values subject to change include, but are not limited to, those related to loans and leases, certain deposits, intangibles, deferred tax assets and liabilities and certain other assets and other liabilities. 

A summary of the net assets acquired and the estimated fair value adjustments resulting in the bargain purchase gain is as follows: 

(in millions) March 20, 2023 Net assets acquired before fair value adjustments $ 2,973 &#160; Fair value adjustments: Loans ( 727 ) Core deposit and other intangibles 464 &#160; Certificates of deposit 27 &#160; Other net assets and liabilities 39 &#160; FDIC Equity Appreciation Instrument ( 85 ) Deferred tax liability ( 690 ) Bargain purchase gain on Signature Transaction, as initially reported $ 2,001 &#160; Measurement period adjustments, excluding taxes 53 &#160; Change in deferred tax liability 88 &#160; Bargain purchase gain on Signature Transaction, as adjusted $ 2,142 &#160; 

In connection with the Signature Transaction, the Company recorded a bargain purchase gain, as adjusted, of approximately $ 2.1 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2023, which is included in non-interest income in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income. 

The bargain purchase gain represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the assets acquired (including cash payments received from the FDIC) over the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed and is influenced significantly by the FDIC-assisted transaction process. Under the FDIC-assisted transaction process, only certain assets and liabilities are transferred to the acquirer and, depending on the nature and amount of the acquirers bid, the FDIC may be required to make a cash payment to the Company and the Company may be required to make a cash payment to the FDIC. 

The assets acquired and liabilities assumed and consideration paid in the Signature Transaction were initially recorded at their estimated fair values based on management&#8217;s best estimates using information available at the date of the Signature Transaction, and are subject to adjustment for up to one year after the closing date of the Signature Transaction. The Company and the FDIC are engaged in ongoing discussions and settlement payments have been made that have impacted certain assets acquired or certain liabilities assumed by the Company on March 20, 2023 and are included as measurement period adjustments in the table below. 

(in millions) As Initially Reported Measurement Period Adjustments As Adjusted Purchase Price consideration $ 85 &#160; $ &#8212; $ 85 &#160; Fair value of assets acquired: Cash &#38; cash equivalents 25,043 &#160; &#8212; 25,043 &#160; Loans held for sale 232 &#160; &#8212; 232 &#160; Loans held for investment: Commercial and industrial 10,102 &#160; ( 214 ) 9,888 &#160; Commercial real estate 1,942 &#160; ( 262 ) 1,680 &#160; Consumer and other 174 &#160; ( 1 ) 173 &#160; Total loans held for investment 12,218 &#160; ( 477 ) 11,741 &#160; CDI and other intangible assets 464 &#160; 464 &#160; Other assets 679 &#160; ( 153 ) 526 &#160; Total assets acquired 38,636 &#160; ( 630 ) 38,006 &#160; Fair value of liabilities assumed: Deposits 33,568 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 33,568 &#160; Other liabilities 2,982 &#160; ( 771 ) 2,211 &#160; Total liabilities assumed 36,550 &#160; ( 771 ) 35,779 &#160; Fair value of net identifiable assets 2,086 &#160; 141 &#160; 2,227 &#160; Bargain purchase gain $ 2,001 &#160; $ 141 &#160; $ 2,142 &#160; 

During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded preliminary measurement period adjustments to adjust the estimated fair value of loans and leases acquired and adjust other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities for balances ultimately retained by the FDIC. Additionally, $ 449 million of loans were returned to the FDIC in accordance with the purchase and sale agreement. The Company also recognized a net change in the deferred tax liability due to the measurement period adjustments and the secondary offering of shares completed by the FDIC. 

Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, reflecting assumptions that a market participant would use when pricing an asset or liability. In some cases, the estimation of fair values requires management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions, and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and are subject to change. Described below are the methods used to determine the fair values of the significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Signature Transaction. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The estimated fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their stated face amounts, as these financial instruments are either due on demand or have short-term maturities. 

Loans and leases 

The fair value for loans was based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered credit loss expectations, market interest rates and other market factors such as liquidity from the perspective of a market participant. Loans were grouped together according to similar characteristics and were treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques. The probability of default, loss given default and prepayment assumptions were the key factors driving credit losses which were embedded into the estimated cash flows. These assumptions were informed by internal data on loan characteristics, historical loss experience, and current and forecasted economic conditions. The interest and liquidity component of the estimate was determined by discounting interest and principal cash flows through the expected life of each loan. The discount rates used for loans are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and include adjustments for liquidity. The discount rates do not include a factor for credit losses as that has been included as a reduction to the estimated cash flows. Acquired loans were marked to fair value and adjusted for any PCD gross up as of the date of the Signature Transaction. 

Deposit Liabilities 

The fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing checking accounts) is equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand. The fair value of certificates of deposit represents contractual cash flows, discounted using interest rates currently offered on deposits with similar characteristics and remaining maturities. 

Core Deposit Intangible 

Core deposit intangible (&#8220;CDI&#8221;) is a measure of the value of non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts that are acquired in a business combination. The fair value of the CDI stemming from any given business combination is based on the present value of the expected cost savings attributable to the core deposit funding, relative to an alternative source of funding. The CDI relating to the Signature Transaction will be amortized over an estimated useful life of 10 years using the sum of years digits depreciation method. The Company evaluates such identifiable intangibles for impairment when an indication of impairment exists. CDI does not significantly impact our liquidity or capital ratios. 

PCD loans 

Purchased loans that reflect a more than insignificant deterioration of credit from origination are considered PCD. For PCD loans and leases, the initial estimate of expected credit losses is recognized in the allowance for credit losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) on the date of acquisition using the same methodology as other loans and leases held-for-investment. The following table provides a summary of loans and leases purchased as part of the Signature Transaction with credit deterioration and the associated credit loss reserve at acquisition: 

(in millions) Total Par value (UPB) $ 583 &#160; ACL at acquisition ( 13 ) Non-credit (discount) ( 76 ) Fair value $ 494 &#160; 

Unaudited Pro Forma Information &#8211; Signature Transaction 

The Company&#8217;s operating results for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended June 30, 2023 include the operating results of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. subsequent to the acquisition on March 20, 2023. Due to the use of multiple systems and integration of the operating activities into those of the Company, historical reporting for the former Signature operations is impracticable and thus disclosures of the revenue from the assets acquired and income before income taxes is impracticable for the period subsequent to acquisition. 

Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. was only in operation from March 12 to March 20, 2023 and does not have historical financial information on which we could base pro forma information. Additionally, we did not acquire all assets or assume all liabilities of Signature and the historical operations are not consistent with the transaction. Therefore, it is impracticable to provide pro forma information on revenues and earnings for the Signature transaction in accordance with ASC 805-10-50-2. 

Flagstar Bank 

On December 1, 2022, the Company closed the acquisition of Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. (&#8220;Flagstar Bancorp&#8221;) in an all-stock transaction. The acquisition of Flagstar has been accounted for as a business combination. The Company recorded the estimate of fair value based on initial valuations available at December 1, 2022. The Company continues to review these valuations and certain of these estimated fair values are considered preliminary as of June 30, 2023, and subject to adjustment for up to one year after December 1, 2022. While the Company believes that the information available on December 1, 2022 provided a reasonable basis for estimating fair value, the Company may obtain additional information and evidence during the measurement period that would result in changes to the estimated fair value amounts. Valuations subject to change include, but are not limited to, loans and leases, certain deposits, intangibles, deferred tax assets and liabilities and certain other assets and other liabilities.

The investment securities designated as having a continuous loss position for twelve months or more at June 30, 2023 consisted of fifty-nine agency collateralized mortgage obligations, six capital trusts notes, nine asset-backed securities, ten corporate bonds, thirty-eight US government agency bonds, 249 mortgage-backed securities, one mutual fund, and one municipal bond. The investment securities designated as having a continuous loss position for twelve months or more at December 31, 2022 consisted of twenty-three agency collateralized mortgage obligations, five capital trusts notes, seven asset-backed securities, two corporate bonds, thirty-three US government agency bonds, 133 mortgage-backed securities, one mutual fund, and one municipal bond. 

The Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions at least quarterly to determine if an allowance for credit losses is required. We also assess whether (i) we intend to sell, or (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria is met, any previously recognized allowances are charged off and the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. If neither of the aforementioned criteria are met, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited 

by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. 

In the first quarter of 2023, the company held a $ 20 million corporate bond in Signature Bank which was placed into receivership on March 12, 2023. We have taken a $ 20 million provision for credit loss and charged-off this security during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

None of the remaining unrealized losses identified as of June 30, 2023 or December 31, 2022 relates to the marketability of the securities or the issuers&#8217; ability to honor redemption obligations. Rather, the unrealized losses relate to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and do not indicate credit-related impairment. Management based this conclusion on an analysis of each issuer including a detailed credit assessment of each issuer. The Company does not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the positions before the recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. As such, no allowance for credit losses remains with respect to debt securities as of June 30, 2023. 

Note 6 - Loans and Leases

Loans with Government Guarantees 

Substantially all LGG are insured or guaranteed by the FHA or the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Nonperforming repurchased loans in this portfolio earn interest at a rate based upon the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rate from the time the underlying loan becomes 60 days delinquent until the loan is conveyed to HUD (if foreclosure timelines are met), which is not paid by the FHA until claimed. The Bank has a unilateral option to repurchase loans sold to GNMA if the loan is due, but unpaid, for three consecutive months (typically referred to as 90 days past due) and can recover losses through a claims process from the guarantor. These loans are recorded in loans held for investment and the liability to repurchase the loans is recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Certain loans within our portfolio may be subject to 

indemnifications and insurance limits which expose us to limited credit risk. As of June 30, 2023, LGG loans totaled $ 614 million and the repurchase liability was $ 333 million. 

Repossessed assets and the associated net claims related to government guaranteed loans are recorded in other assets and was $ 13 million at June 30, 2023. 

Loans Held-for-Sale 

Loans held-for-sale at June 30, 2023 totaled $ 2.2 billion, up from $ 1.1 billion at December 31, 2022. The Signature Transaction contributed $ 360 million in Small Business Administration ("SBA") loans to this increase. We classify loans as held for sale when we originate or purchase loans that we intend to sell. We have elected the fair value option for nearly all of this portfolio, except the SBA loans. We estimate the fair value of mortgage loans based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans, where available, or by discounting estimated cash flows using observable inputs inclusive of interest rates, prepayment speeds and loss assumptions for similar collateral. 

Asset Quality 

All asset quality information excludes LGG that are insured by U.S government agencies. 

A loan generally is classified as a non-accrual loan when it is 90 days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because the Company no longer expects to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, management ceases the accrual of interest owed, and previously accrued interest is charged against interest income. A loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is current and management has reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible. Interest income on non-accrual loans is recorded when received in cash. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 we had no loans that were nonperforming and still accruing. 

The following table presents information regarding the quality of the Company&#8217;s loans held for investment at June 30, 2023:

The preceding classifications are the most current ones available and generally have been updated within the last twelve months. In addition, they follow regulatory guidelines and can generally be described as follows: pass loans are of satisfactory quality; special mention loans have potential weaknesses that deserve management&#8217;s close attention; substandard loans are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged (these loans have a well-defined weakness and there is a possibility that the Company will sustain some loss); and doubtful loans, based on existing circumstances, have weaknesses that make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable. In addition, one-to-four family loans are classified based on the duration of the delinquency.

When management determines that foreclosure is probable, for loans that are individually evaluated the expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral adjusted for selling costs. When the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the reporting date and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the collateral-dependent practical expedient has been elected and expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. For CRE loans, collateral properties include office buildings, warehouse/distribution buildings, shopping centers, apartment buildings, residential and commercial tract development. The primary source of repayment on these loans is expected to come from the sale, permanent financing or lease of the real property collateral. CRE loans are impacted by fluctuations in collateral values, as well as the ability of the borrower to obtain permanent financing. 

The following table summarizes the extent to which collateral secures the Company&#8217;s collateral-dependent loans held for investment by collateral type as of June 30, 2023:

Other collateral type consists of taxi medallions, cash, accounts receivable and inventory. 

There were no significant changes in the extent to which collateral secures the Company&#8217;s collateral-dependent financial assets during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. 

At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 93 million and $ 122 million of residential mortgage loans in the process of foreclosure and no residential mortgage loans in the process of foreclosure, respectively. 

Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 

Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02- Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. For additional information on the adoption, refer to Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation. 

When borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty, the Company may make certain loan modifications as part of loss mitigation strategies to maximize expected payment. Modifications in the form of principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, or an other-than-insignificant payment delay or a term extension that have occurred in the current reporting period to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are disclosed along with the financial impact of the modifications. 

The following table summarizes the amortized cost basis of loans modified during the reporting period to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, disaggregated by class of financing receivable and type of modification:

As of June 30, 2023, there were $ 3 million one-to-four family first mortgages that were modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that received term extension and subsequently defaulted during the period and $ 3 million one-to-four family first mortgages that were combination modifications and subsequently defaulted during the period. 

The performance of loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in which modifications were made is closely monitored to understand the effectiveness of modification efforts. Loans are considered to be in payment default at 90 or more days past due. The following table depicts the performance of loans that have been modified during the reporting period:

Troubled Debt Restructurings Prior to Adoption of ASU 2022-02 

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, the Company accounted for certain loan modifications and restructurings as TDRs. In general, a modification or restructuring of a loan constituted a TDR if the Company granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. A loan modified as a TDR was generally placed on non-accrual status until the Company determined that future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured, which requires, among other things, that the borrower demonstrate performance according to the restructured terms for a period of at least six consecutive months. In determining the Company&#8217;s allowance for loan and lease losses, reasonably expected TDRs were individually evaluated and consist of criticized, classified, or maturing loans that will have a modification processed within the next three months. 

In an effort to proactively manage delinquent loans, the Company has selectively extended to certain borrowers concessions such as rate reductions, extension of maturity dates, and forbearance agreements. As of June 30, 2022, loans on which concessions were made with respect to rate reductions and/or extension of maturity dates amounted to $ 45 million. 

The following table presents information regarding the Company's TDRs as of June 30, 2022: 

June 30, 2022 (dollars in millions) Accruing Non- Accrual Total Loan Category: Multi-family $ &#8212; &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 6 &#160; Commercial real estate 16 19 35

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases 

The following table summarizes activity in the allowance for credit losses for the periods indicated:

As of June 30, 2023, the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases totaled $ 594 million, up $ 201 million compared to December 31, 2022. 

The increase in the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases from December 31, 2022 to June 30, 2023 was primarily driven by a combination of increased loan balances as a result of the Signature Transaction and changes in the macroeconomic environment both on a spot and forecasted basis, specifically the inflationary pressures leading to sharp increases in interest rates and a slow-down of prepayment activity leading to longer weighted average lives on the balance sheet. 

As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the allowance for unfunded commitments totaled $ 34 million and $ 23 million, respectively. 

The Company charges off loans, or portions of loans, in the period that such loans, or portions thereof, are deemed uncollectible. The collectability of individual loans is determined through an assessment of the financial condition and repayment capacity of the borrower and/or through an estimate of the fair value of any underlying collateral. For non-real estate-related consumer credits, the following past-due time periods determine when charge-offs are typically recorded: (1) closed-end credits are charged off in the quarter that the loan becomes 120 days past due; (2) open-end credits are charged off in the quarter that the loan becomes 180 days past due; and (3) both closed-end and open-end credits are typically charged off in the quarter that the credit is 60 days past the date the Company received notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy.

Note 8 - Leases 

Lessor Arrangements 

The Company is a lessor in the equipment finance business where it has executed direct financing leases (&#8220;lease finance receivables&#8221;). The Company produces lease finance receivables through a specialty finance subsidiary that participates in syndicated loans that are brought to them, and equipment loans and leases that are assigned to them, by a select group of nationally recognized sources, and are generally made to large corporate obligors, many of which are publicly traded, carry investment grade or near-investment grade ratings, and participate in stable industries nationwide. Lease finance receivables are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased assets and any initial direct costs incurred to originate these leases, less unearned income, which is accreted to interest income over the lease term using the interest method. 

The standard leases are typically repayable on a level monthly basis with terms ranging from 24 to 120 months. At the end of the lease term, the lessee usually has the option to return the equipment, to renew the lease or purchase the equipment at the then fair market value (&#8220;FMV&#8221;) price. For leases with a FMV renewal/purchase option, the relevant residual value assumptions are based on the estimated value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, including evaluation of key factors, such as, the estimated remaining useful life of the leased asset, its historical secondary market value including history of the lessee executing the FMV option, overall credit evaluation and return provisions. The Company acquires the leased asset at fair market value and provides funding to the respective lessee at acquisition cost, less any volume or trade discounts, as applicable. Therefore, there is generally no selling profit or loss to recognize or defer at inception of a lease. 

The residual value component of a lease financing receivable represents the estimated fair value of the leased equipment at the end of the lease term. In establishing residual value estimates, the Company may rely on industry data, historical experience, and independent appraisals and, where appropriate, information regarding product life cycle, product upgrades and competing products. Upon expiration of a lease, residual assets are remarketed, resulting in either an extension of the lease by the lessee, a lease to a new customer or purchase of the residual asset by the lessee or another party. Impairment of residual values arises if the expected fair value is less than the carrying amount. The Company assesses its net investment in lease financing receivables (including residual values) for impairment on an annual basis with any impairment losses recognized in accordance with the impairment guidance for financial instruments. As such, net investment in lease financing receivables may be reduced by an allowance for credit losses with changes recognized as provision expense. On certain lease financings, the Company obtains residual value insurance from third parties to manage and reduce the risk associated with the residual value of the leased assets. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying value of residual assets with third-party residual value insurance for at least a portion of the asset value was $ 428 million and $ 32 million, respectively. 

The Company uses the interest rate implicit in the lease to determine the present value of its lease financing receivables. 

The components of lease income were as follows:

At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying value of net investment in leases, excluding purchase accounting adjustments was $ 3.3 billion and $ 1.7 billion, respectively. The components of net investment in direct financing leases, including the carrying amount of the lease receivables, as well as the unguaranteed residual asset were as follows:

Lessee Arrangements 

The Company has operating leases for corporate offices, branch locations, and certain equipment. These leases generally have terms of 20 years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. For the vast majority of the Company&#8217;s leases, we are not reasonably certain we will exercise our options to renew to the end of all renewal option periods. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. 

ROU assets represent the Company&#8217;s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the vast majority of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, the incremental borrowing rate (FHLB borrowing rate) is used based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The implicit rate is used when readily determinable. The operating lease ROU asset is measured at cost, which includes the initial measurement of the lease liability, prepaid rent and initial direct costs incurred by the Company, less incentives received. 

Variable costs such as the proportionate share of actual costs for utilities, common area maintenance, property taxes and insurance are not included in the lease liability and are recognized in the period in which they are incurred.

Note 9 - Mortgage Servicing Rights 

The Company has investments in MSRs that result from the sale of loans to the secondary market for which we retain the servicing. The Company accounts for MSRs at their fair value. A primary risk associated with MSRs is the potential reduction in fair value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments due to loan refinancing prompted, in part, by declining interest rates or government intervention. Conversely, these assets generally increase in value in a rising interest rate environment to the extent that prepayments are slower than anticipated. The Company utilizes derivatives as economic hedges to offset changes in the fair value of the MSRs resulting from the actual or anticipated changes in prepayments stemming from changing interest rate environments. There is also a risk of valuation decline due to higher than expected default rates, which we do not believe can be effectively managed using derivatives. For further information regarding the derivative instruments utilized to manage our MSR risks, see Note 14 - Derivative and Hedging Activities. 

Changes in the fair value of residential first mortgage MSRs were as follows: 

(in millions) Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 Balance at beginning of period $ 1,034 &#160; $ 1,033 &#160; Additions from loans sold with servicing retained 43 &#160; 81 &#160; Reductions from sales ( 51 ) ( 51 )

21 &#160; 2 &#160; Fair value of MSRs at end of period $ 1,031 &#160; $ 1,031 &#160; 

(1) Changes in fair value are included within net return on mortgage servicing rights on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 

(2) Represents estimated MSR value change resulting primarily from market-driven changes which we manage through the use of derivatives. 

The following table summarizes the hypothetical effect on the fair value of servicing rights using adverse changes of 10 percent and 20 percent to the weighted average of certain significant assumptions used in valuing these assets: 

June 30, 2023 Fair Value (dollars in millions) Actual 10% adverse change 20% adverse change Option adjusted spread 5.6 &#160; % $ 1,011 &#160; $ 993 &#160; Constant prepayment rate 8.2 &#160; % 997 &#160; 966 &#160; Weighted average cost to service per loan $ 69 &#160; $ 1,021 &#160; $ 1,011 &#160; 

December 31, 2022 Fair Value (dollars in millions) Actual 10% adverse change 20% adverse change Option adjusted spread 5.9 &#160; % $ 1,012 &#160; $ 992 &#160; Constant prepayment rate 7.9 &#160; % 1,000 &#160; 970 &#160; Weighted average cost to service per loan $ 68 &#160; $ 1,023 &#160; $ 1,013 &#160; 

The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. To isolate the effect of the specified change, the fair value shock analysis is consistent with the identified adverse change, while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, a change in one assumption generally impacts other assumptions, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change. For further information on the fair value of MSRs. 

Contractual servicing and subservicing fees, including late fees and other ancillary income are presented below. Contractual servicing fees are included within net return on mortgage servicing rights on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Contractual subservicing fees including late fees and other ancillary income are included within loan administration income on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Subservicing fee income is recorded for fees earned on subserviced loans, net of third-party subservicing costs.

Note 10 - Variable Interest Entities 

We have no consolidated VIEs as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

In connection with our non-qualified mortgage securitization activities, we have retained a five percent interest in the investment securities of certain trusts ("other MBS") and are contracted as the subservicer of the underlying loans, compensated based on market rates, which constitutes a continuing involvement in these trusts. Although we have a variable interest in these securitization trusts, we are not their primary beneficiary due to the relative size of our investment in comparison to the total amount of securities issued by the VIE and our inability to direct activities that most significantly impact the VIE&#8217;s economic performance. As a result, we have not consolidated the assets and liabilities of the VIE in our Consolidated Statements of Condition. The Bank&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss is limited to our five percent retained interest in the investment securities that had a fair value of $ 183 million as of June 30, 2023 as well as the standard representations and warranties made in conjunction with the loan transfers.

Note 13 - Stock-Related Benefits Plans 

Stock Based Compensation 

At June 30, 2023, the Company had a total of 19,213,596 shares available for grants as restricted stock, options, or other forms of related rights under the 2020 Incentive Plan, which includes the remaining shares available, converted at the merger conversion factor from the legacy Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. 2016 Stock Plan. The Company granted 6,388,840 shares of restricted stock, with an average fair value of $ 9.57 per share on the date of grant, during the six months ended June 30, 2023. 

The shares of restricted stock that were granted during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, vest over a one - or five years period. Compensation and benefits expense related to the restricted stock grants is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and totaled $ 18 million and $ 14 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, including $ 9 million and $ 7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022.

Note 14 - Derivative and Hedging Activities 

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposure to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate and liquidity risks, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and, the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. 

Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in other assets and other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. The Company's policy is to present our derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Condition on a gross basis, even when provisions allowing for set-off are in place. However, for derivative contracts cleared through certain central clearing parties, variation margin payments are recognized as settlements. We are exposed to non-performance risk by the counterparties to our various derivative financial instruments. A majority of our derivatives are centrally cleared through a Central Counterparty Clearing House or consist of residential mortgage interest rate lock commitments further limiting our exposure to non-performance risk. We believe that the non-performance risk inherent in our remaining derivative contracts is minimal based on credit standards and the collateral provisions of the derivative agreements. 

Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. The Company maintains a derivative portfolio of interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, futures and forward commitments used to manage exposure to changes in interest rates and MSR asset values and to meet the needs of customers. The Company also enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. Market risk on interest rate lock commitments and mortgage LHFS is managed using corresponding forward sale commitments and US Treasury futures. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 

Derivatives designated as hedging instruments . The Company has designated certain interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges on overnight SOFR-based variable interest payments on federal home loan bank advances. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Condition and reclassified into interest expense in the same period in which the hedge transaction is recognized in earnings. At June 30, 2023, the Company had $ 69 million (net-of-tax) of unrealized gains on derivatives classified as cash flow hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company had $ 52 million ( net-of-tax) of unrealized gains on derivatives classified as cash flow hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2022. 

Derivatives that are designated in hedging relationships are assessed for effectiveness using regression analysis at inception and qualitatively thereafter, unless regression analysis is deemed necessary. All designated hedge relationships were, and are expected to be, highly effective as of June 30, 2023. 

Fair Value of Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 

The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its fixed-rate assets due to changes in interest rates. The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Such derivatives were used to hedge the changes in fair value of certain of its pools of prepayable fixed rate assets. For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income. 

The Company has entered into interest rate swaps with a notional amounts of $ 2.0 billion to hedge certain real estate loans using the portfolio layer method. For the three months ended June 30, 2023 , the floating rate received related to the net settlement of this interest rate swap was greater than the fixed rate payments. As such, interest income from loans and leases in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income was increased by $ 6 million. 

The fair value basis adjustment on our hedged real estate loans is included in loans and leases held for investment on our Consolidated Statements of Condition. The carrying amount of our hedged loans was $ 6.4 billion at June 30, 2023 , of which unrealized gains of $ 34 million were due to the fair value hedge relationship. We have designated $ 2.0 billion of this portfolio of loans in a hedging relationship as of June 30, 2023 .

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 

The Company&#8217;s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of amounts subject to variability caused by changes in interest rates from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged transaction affects income. 

Interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $ 5.5 billion and $ 2.3 billion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, were designated as cash flow hedges of certain FHLB borrowings. 

The following table presents the effect of the Company&#8217;s cash flow derivative instruments on AOCL:

Amounts reported in AOCL related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company&#8217;s variable-rate borrowings. During the next twelve months, additional interest expense reduction of $ 120 million is expected to be reclassified out of AOCL.

Note 15 - Intangible Assets 

Goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, at least once a year. There was no change in goodwill during the six months ended June 30, 2023. 

As a result of the Signature Transaction, the Company recorded $ 462 million of core deposit intangible and other intangible assets that are amortizable. 

At June 30, 2023, intangible assets consisted of the following:

The estimated amortization expense of CDI and other intangible assets for the next five years is as follows: 

(in millions) Amortization Expense 2023 $ 49 &#160; 2024 108 &#160; 2025 88 &#160; 2026 79 &#160; 2027 71 &#160; Total $ 395 &#160; 

Note 16 - Fair Value Measures 

GAAP sets forth a definition of fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value, and requires disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis. GAAP also clarifies that fair value is an &#8220;exit&#8221; price, representing the amount that would be received when selling an asset, or paid when transferring a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is thus a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

&#8226; Level 1 &#8211; Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

&#8226; Level 2 &#8211; Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

&#8226; Level 3 &#8211; Inputs to the valuation methodology are significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company&#8217;s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability. 

A financial instrument&#8217;s categorization within this valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

The following tables present assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and that were included in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition at those dates:

The Company reviews and updates the fair value hierarchy classifications for its assets on a quarterly basis. Changes from one quarter to the next that are related to the observability of inputs for a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification from one hierarchy level to another. 

A description of the methods and significant assumptions utilized in estimating the fair values of securities follows: 

Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities include highly liquid government securities and exchange-traded securities. 

If quoted market prices are not available for a specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models. These pricing models primarily use market-based or independently sourced market parameters as inputs, including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, equity or debt prices, and credit spreads. In addition to observable market information, models incorporate transaction details such as maturity and cash flow assumptions. Securities valued in this manner would generally be classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, and primarily include such instruments as mortgage-related and corporate debt securities. 

Periodically, the Company uses fair values supplied by independent pricing services to corroborate the fair values derived from the pricing models. In addition, the Company reviews the fair values supplied by independent pricing services, as well as their underlying pricing methodologies, for reasonableness. The Company challenges pricing service valuations that appear to be unusual or unexpected. 

While the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate, and consistent with those of other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair values of certain financial instruments could result in different estimates of fair values at a reporting date.

Gains and losses for individual lines do not reflect the effect of our risk management activities related to such Level 3 instruments. 

(2) Rate lock commitments are reported on a fallout-adjusted basis. Transfers out of Level 3 represent the settlement value of the commitments that are transferred to LHFS, which are classified as Level 2 assets. 

The following tables present the quantitative information about recurring Level 3 fair value financial instruments and the fair value measurements as of June 30, 2023:

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 

Certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Such instruments are subject to fair value adjustments under certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). The following tables present assets that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and that were included in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition at those dates:

These equity securities are classified as Level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares. 

(2) Represents the fair value of impaired loans, based on the value of the collateral. 

The fair values of collateral-dependent impaired loans are determined using various valuation techniques, including consideration of appraised values and other pertinent real estate and other market data. 

Other Fair Value Disclosures 

For the disclosure of fair value information about the Company&#8217;s on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments, when available, quoted market prices are used as the measure of fair value. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on present-value estimates or other valuation techniques. Such fair values are significantly affected by the assumptions used, the timing of future cash flows, and the discount rate. 

Because assumptions are inherently subjective in nature, estimated fair values cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent market quotes. Furthermore, in many cases, the estimated fair values provided would not necessarily be realized in an immediate sale or settlement of such instruments. 

The following tables summarize the carrying values, estimated fair values, and fair value measurement levels of financial instruments that were not carried at fair value on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

The methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair values for the Company&#8217;s financial instruments follow: 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks and federal funds sold. The estimated fair values of cash and cash equivalents are assumed to equal their carrying values, as these financial instruments are either due on demand or have short-term maturities. 

Securities 

If quoted market prices are not available for a specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows. These pricing models primarily use market-based or independently sourced market parameters as inputs, including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, equity or debt prices, and credit spreads. In addition to observable market information, pricing models also incorporate transaction details such as maturities and cash flow assumptions. 

Federal Home Loan Bank Stock 

Ownership in equity securities of the FHLB is generally restricted and there is no established liquid market for their resale. The carrying amount approximates the fair value. 

Loans 

The Company discloses the fair value of loans measured at amortized cost using an exit price notion. The Company determined the fair value on substantially all of its loans for disclosure purposes, on an individual loan basis. The discount rates reflect current market rates for loans with similar terms to borrowers having similar credit quality on an exit price basis. The estimated fair values of non-performing mortgage and other loans are based on recent collateral appraisals. For those loans where a discounted cash flow technique was not considered reliable, the Company used a quoted market price for each individual loan. 

MSRs 

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the MSRs are option adjusted spreads, prepayment rates and cost to service. Significant increases (decreases) in all three assumptions in isolation result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Weighted average life (in years) is used to determine the change in fair value of MSRs. For June 30, 2023, the weighted average life (in years) for the entire MSR portfolio was 6.96 . 

Rate lock commitments 

The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the rate lock commitments is the pull through rate. The pull through rate is a statistical analysis of our actual rate lock fallout history to determine the sensitivity of the residential mortgage loan pipeline compared to interest rate changes and other deterministic values. New market prices are applied based on updated loan characteristics and new fallout ratios (i.e. the inverse of the pull through rate) are applied accordingly. Significant increases (decreases) in the pull through rate in isolation result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. 

Deposits 

The fair values of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., interest-bearing checking and money market accounts, savings accounts, and non-interest-bearing accounts) are equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand. The fair values of CDs represent contractual cash flows, discounted using interest rates currently offered on deposits with similar characteristics and remaining maturities. These estimated fair values do not include the intangible value of core deposit relationships, which comprise a portion of the Company&#8217;s deposit base. 

Borrowed Funds 

The estimated fair value of borrowed funds is based either on bid quotations received from securities dealers or the discounted value of contractual cash flows with interest rates currently in effect for borrowed funds with similar maturities and structures. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments 

The fair values of commitments to extend credit and unadvanced lines of credit are estimated based on an analysis of the interest rates and fees currently charged to enter into similar transactions, considering the remaining terms of the commitments and the creditworthiness of the potential borrowers. The estimated fair values of such off-balance sheet financial instruments were insignificant at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Fair Value Option 

We elected the fair value option for certain items as discussed throughout the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements to more closely align the accounting method with the underlying economic exposure. Interest income on LHFS is accrued on the principal outstanding primarily using the "simple-interest" method. 

The following table reflects the change in fair value included in earnings of financial instruments for which the fair value option has been elected:
