 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

For the purpose of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the words &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; and the &#8220;Company&#8221; are used to refer to New York Community Bancorp, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiary, New York Community Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). 

&#160;

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING LANGUAGE 

This report, like many written and oral communications presented by New York Community Bancorp, Inc. and our authorized officers, may contain certain forward-looking statements regarding our prospective performance and strategies within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are including this statement for purposes of said safe harbor provisions. 

Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans, strategies, and expectations of the Company, are generally identified by use of the words &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;seek,&#8221; &#8220;strive,&#8221; &#8220;try,&#8221; or future or conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; or similar expressions. Although we believe that our plans, intentions, and expectations as reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will be achieved or realized. 

Our ability to predict results or the actual effects of our plans and strategies is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results, performance, or achievements could differ materially from those contemplated, expressed, or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.

&#160;

&#8226; other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, technological, and geopolitical factors affecting our operations, pricing, and services. 

In addition, the timing and occurrence or non-occurrence of events may be subject to circumstances beyond our control. 

Furthermore, on an ongoing basis, we evaluate opportunities to expand through mergers and acquisitions and opportunities for strategic combinations with other banking organizations. Our evaluation of such opportunities involves discussions with other parties, due diligence, and negotiations. As a result, we may decide to enter into definitive arrangements regarding such opportunities at any time. 

In addition to the risks and challenges described above, these types of transactions involve a number of other risks and challenges, including: 

&#8226; the ability to successfully integrate branches and operations and to implement appropriate internal controls and regulatory functions relating to such activities;

RECONCILIATIONS OF STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY, COMMON STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY, 

AND TANGIBLE COMMON STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY; 

TOTAL ASSETS AND TANGIBLE ASSETS; AND THE RELATED MEASURES 

(unaudited) 

While stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, total assets, and book value per common share are financial measures that are recorded in accordance with GAAP, tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity, tangible assets, and tangible book value per common share are not. It is management&#8217;s belief that these non-GAAP measures should be disclosed in this report and others we issue for the following reasons: 

1. Tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity is an important indication of the Company&#8217;s ability to grow organically and through business combinations, as well as its ability to pay dividends and to engage in various capital management strategies. 

2. Tangible book value per common share and the ratio of tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity to tangible assets are among the capital measures considered by current and prospective investors, both independent of, and in comparison with, the Company&#8217;s peers. 

Tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity, tangible assets, and the related non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, total assets, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate these non-GAAP measures may differ from that of other companies reporting non-GAAP measures with similar names. 

Reconciliations of our stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, and tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity; our total assets and tangible assets; and the related financial measures for the respective periods follow:

Third Quarter 2022 Overview 

At September 30, 2022, total assets were $63.0 billion, up $3.4 billion or 8% annualized compared to December 31, 2021. The year-to-date increase was due primarily to growth in our loan portfolio, and to a lesser extent, growth in the securities portfolio, offset slightly by a decline in the level of cash and cash equivalents. 

Total loans held for investment increased $3.2 billion or 9% annualized, ending the quarter at $49.0 billion compared to December 31, 2021. Our loan growth continues to be driven by growth in two categories: multi-family loans and specialty finance loans. 

During the current third quarter, the Company reinvested a portion of its cash balances in short-term treasury securities. Accordingly, total available-for-sale securities increased by $1.0 billion to $6.7 billion, up 18% (not annualized) compared to the second quarter of the year. At the same time, the level of cash balances declined $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. 

On the liability front, total deposits increased $6.6 billion or 25% annualized to $41.7 billion. Once again, the deposit growth was driven by growth in our BaaS business and loan-related deposits. 

Given the strong year-to-date deposit growth, wholesale borrowings declined $2.8 billion or 23% annualized to $13.1 billion compared to December 31, 2021. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2022, the Company reported net income of $152 million, up 2% compared to the $149 million that the Company reported for the three months ended September 30, 2021. Net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2022 totaled $144 million, up 3% compared to the $140 million that the Company reported for the three months September 30, 2021. Diluted EPS were $0.30 for the three months ended September 30, 2022, unchanged compared to the three months ended September 31, 2021. 

Included in the three months ended September 30, 2022 results are $4 million in merger-related expenses compared to $6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, net income totaled $478 million, up 7% compared to $446 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Net income available to common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 totaled $453 million, up 8% compared to $421 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. 

Diluted EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 were $0.96, up 7% compared to $0.90 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

Included in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 were merger-related expenses of $15 million, down modestly compared to $16 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

The key trends in the third quarter of 2022 were: 

Continued Portfolio Loan Growth 

At September 30, 2022, total loans held for investment were $49.0 billion compared to $45.7 billion, up 9% on an annualized basis. The loan portfolio has now grown over the past four consecutive quarters and continues to be driven by growth in both our multi-family and specialty finance businesses. The multi-family portfolio totaled $37.2 billion at September 30, 2022, up $2.6 billion or 10% annualized compared to December 31, 2021 and $407 million or 4% annualized compared to June 30, 2022. The specialty 

&#160;

finance portfolio also continued to increase, growing $755 million or 29% annualized to $4.3 billion compared to December 31, 2021 and $117 million or 11% annualized compared to June 30, 2022. 

The growth in the multi-family portfolio was driven by ongoing market share gains in our non-luxury. rent regulated niche within the New York City multi-family market. Growth in the specialty finance portfolio was primarily driven by draw downs on existing commitments. 

Another Strong Quarter of Deposit Growth 

Total deposits at September 30, 2022 were $41.7 billion, up $6.6 billion or 25% annualized compared to December 31, 2021 and up $461 million or 4% annualized compared to June 30, 2022. The increase was driven by growth in the Company's BaaS business and in loan-related deposits from our borrowers. 

BaaS deposits at September 30, 2022 totaled $7.9 billion, up $5.8 billion on a year-to-date basis. Loan-related deposits totaled $4.8 billion, up $793 million or 26% annualized compared to December 31, 2021. 

Stable Non-Interest Expenses 

For the three months ended September 30, 2022, non-interest expenses totaled $136 million, up 1% compared to the $135 million we reported for the three months ended September 30, 2021, but down 1% compared to the $138 million we reported during the three months ended June 30, 2022. Included in the current third quarter amount are $4 million in merger-related expenses, unchanged compared to the second-quarter 2022 amount and down $2 million compared to the $6 million in merger-related expenses we reported during third-quarter 2021. 

Recent Events 

Declaration of Dividend on Common Shares 

On October 25, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the Company&#8217;s common stock of $0.17 per share. The dividend is payable on November 17, 2022 to common shareholders of record as of November 7, 2022. 

Receipt of OCC Approval for Bank Merger and Merger Extension 

On October 28, 2022, the Company and Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. (&#34;Flagstar&#34;) jointly announced the receipt of approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Company (the &#34;OCC&#34;) to convert Flagstar Bank, FSB to a national bank to be known as Flagstar Bank, N.A., and to merge New York Community Bank into Flagstar Bank, N.A. with Flagstar Bank being the surviving entity. 

The acquisition of Flagstar by the Company is still subject to the approval of the FRB, as well as the satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions under the merger agreement, as amended, between the two companies (the &#34;Merger Agreement&#34;). The OCC approval is subject to a statutory 15-day waiting period that provides that the bank merger cannot be consummated until 15 days after OCC approval has been received, which in this case is November 11, 2022. There is no associated waiting period with the FRB approval. NYCB and Flagstar intend to consummate the holding company and bank merger promptly after FRB approval is received and the OCC waiting period ends. 

In addition, NYCB and Flagstar announced that they have mutually agreed to extend the Merger Agreement to December 31, 2022 from October 31, 2022 to provide additional time to obtain regulatory approval from the FRB. The extension was approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Flagstar shareholders will receive 4.0151 shares of Company common stock for each Flagstar share they own. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

We consider certain accounting policies to be critically important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, since they require management to make complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. The inherent sensitivity of our consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies, and the judgments, estimates, and assumptions used therein, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 

We have identified the following to be critical accounting policies: the determination of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases. 

The judgments used by management in applying these critical accounting policies may be influenced by adverse changes in the economic environment, which may result in changes to future financial results. 

&#160;

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The Company&#8217;s January 1, 2020, adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, &#8220;Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,&#8221; resulted in a significant change to our methodology for estimating the allowance since December 31, 2019. ASU No. 2016-13 replaced the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the CECL methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under CECL is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables. It also applies to off-balance sheet exposures not accounted for as insurance and net investments in leases accounted for under ASC Topic 842. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases is deducted from the amortized cost basis of a financial asset or a group of financial assets so that the balance sheet reflects the net amount the Company expects to collect. Amortized cost is the unpaid loan balance, net of deferred fees and expenses, and includes negative escrow. Subsequent changes (favorable and unfavorable) in expected credit losses are recognized immediately in net income as a credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense. Management estimates the allowance by projecting and multiplying together the probability-of-default, loss-given-default and exposure-at-default depending on economic parameters for each month of the remaining contractual term. Economic parameters are developed using available information relating to past events, current conditions, and economic forecasts. The Company&#8217;s economic forecast period is 24 months, and afterwards reverts to a historical average loss rate on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Historical credit experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, with qualitative adjustments made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency levels and terms, as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in legislation, regulation, policies, administrative practices or other relevant factors. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for forecasted prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes potential extensions or renewals. The methodology used in the estimation of the allowance for loan and lease losses, which is performed at least quarterly, is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and forecasted economic conditions. Each quarter the Company reassesses the appropriateness of the economic forecasting period, the reversion period and historical mean at the portfolio segment level, considering any required adjustments for differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, and other relevant data shifts over time. 

&#160;

The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The portfolio segment represents the level at which a systematic methodology is applied to estimate credit losses. Management believes the products within each of the entity&#8217;s portfolio segments exhibit similar risk characteristics. Smaller pools of homogenous financing receivables with homogeneous risk characteristics were modeled using the methodology selected for the portfolio segment. The macroeconomic data used in the quantitative models are based on a reasonable and supportable forecast period of 24 months. The Company leverages economic projections including property market and prepayment forecasts from established independent third parties to inform its loss drivers in the forecast. Beyond this forecast period, the Company reverts to a historical average loss rate. This reversion to the historical average loss rate is performed on a straight-line basis over 12 months. 

&#160;

Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. These include loans that are in nonaccrual status with balances above management determined materiality thresholds depending on loan class and also loans that are designated as TDR or &#8220;reasonably expected TDR&#8221; (criticized, classified, or maturing loans that will have a modification processed within the next three months). In addition, all taxi medallion loans are individually evaluated. If a loan is determined to be collateral dependent, or meets the criteria to apply the collateral dependent practical expedient, expected credit losses are determined based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, less costs to sell as appropriate. 

&#160;

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures was $7 million and $12 million, respectively. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit losses expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over their estimated life. The Company examined historical credit conversion factor (&#8220;CCF&#8221;) trends to estimate utilization rates, and chose an appropriate mean CCF based on both management judgment and quantitative analysis. Quantitative analysis involved examination of CCFs over a range of fund-up windows (between 12 and 36 months) and comparison of the mean CCF for each fund-up window with management judgment determining whether the highest mean CCF across fund-up windows made business sense. The Company applies the same standards and estimated loss rates to the credit exposures as to the related class of loans. 

&#160;

When applying this critical accounting policy, we incorporate several inputs and judgments that may be influenced by changes period to period. These include, but are not limited to changes in the economic environment and forecasts, changes in the credit profile and characteristics of the loan portfolio, and changes in prepayment assumptions which will result in provisions to or recoveries from the balance of the allowance for credit losses. 

&#160;

&#160;

While changes to the economic environment forecasts, and portfolio characteristics will change from period to period, portfolio prepayments are an integral assumption in estimating the allowance for credit losses on our mortgage loan portfolio, are subject to estimation uncertainty and changes in this assumption could have a material impact to our estimation process. Prepayment assumptions are sensitive to interest rates and existing loan terms and determine the weighted average life of the mortgage loan portfolio. Excluding other factors, as the weighted average life of the portfolio increases or decreases, so will the required amount of the allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans. 

Balance Sheet Summary 

At September 30, 2022, total assets were $63.0 billion, relatively unchanged compared to the previous quarter and up $3.4 billion or 8% annualized compared to December 31, 2021. The year-to-date increase was driven primarily by loan growth and to a lesser extent, growth in the securities portfolio. The linked-quarter change was driven by loan growth offset largely by a decline in cash balances. 

&#160;

Total loans held for investment increased $3.2 billion or 9% annualized to $49.0 billion compared to December 31, 2021 and up $447 million or 4% annualized compared to June 30, 2022. Loan growth continues to be driven by growth in both the multi-family and specialty finance portfolios. 

&#160;

On the liability side, total deposits increased $6.6 billion or 25% annualized to $41.7 billion compared to December 31, 2021 and rose $461 million or 4% annualized compared to June 30, 2022. At the same time, borrowed funds declined $2.8 billion or 22% annualized to $13.8 billion compared to December 31, 2021 and $509 million or 14% annualized compared to June 30, 2022. 

Loans and Leases 

Loans and Leases Originated for Investment 

The majority of the loans we originate are loans and leases held for investment and most of the held-for-investment loans we produce are multi-family loans. Our production of multi-family loans began over five decades ago in the five boroughs of New York City, where the majority of the rental units currently consist of non-luxury, rent-regulated apartments featuring below-market rents. In addition to multi-family loans, our portfolio of loans held for investment contains a number of CRE loans, most of which are secured by income-producing properties located in New York City and Long Island. 

In addition to multi-family and CRE loans, our specialty finance loans and leases have become an increasingly larger portion of our overall loan portfolio. The remainder of our portfolio includes smaller balances of C&#38;I loans, one-to-four family loans, ADC loans, and other loans held for investment. The majority of C&#38;I loans consist of loans to small- and mid-size businesses. 

Loan originations for the three months ended September 30, 2022 totaled $3.8 billion, up 27% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021, but down 29% compared to the record amount of loans the Company originated during the three months ended June 30, 2022. Third quarter 2022 originations exceeded the prior quarter's pipeline of $2.5 billion by $1.2 billion or 147%. 

During the current third quarter, multi-family originations totaled $1.7 billion, down slightly compared to the year-ago third quarter and down $1.2 billion compared to the record second-quarter origination volumes. Specialty finance originations totaled $1.6 billion during the current third quarter, up nearly double compared to the third quarter of 2021 and down $317 million compared to second quarter 2022. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, total loan originations were $12.6 billion, up $4 billion or 47% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. On a year-over-year basis, multi-family originations increased 32% to $7.1 billion, while specialty finance originations more than doubled to $4.1 billion.

Loans and Leases Held for Investment 

The individual held-for-investment loan portfolios are discussed in detail below. 

Multi-Family Loans 

Multi-family loans are our principal asset. The loans we produce are primarily secured by non-luxury residential apartment buildings in New York City that are rent-regulated and feature below-market rents&#8212;a market we refer to as our &#8220;Primary Lending Niche.&#8221; The majority of our multi-family loans are made to long-term owners of buildings with apartments that are subject to rent regulation and feature below-market rents. 

At September 30, 2022, total multi-family loans represented $37.2 billion or 76% of total loans and leases held for investment. 

At September 30, 2022, 71% of our multi-family loans were secured by rental apartment buildings in the New York City metro area and 3% were secured by buildings elsewhere in New York State. The remaining multi-family loans were secured by buildings outside these markets, including in the four other states in which we operate. 

In addition, 60% or $22.4 billion of the Company's overall multi-family portfolio is secured by properties in New York State, of which $19.5 billion are subject to rent regulation laws. The weighted average LTV of the rent-regulated segment of the multi-family portfolio was 57.05%, as of September 30, 2022, 358 bps below the overall multi-family weighted average LTV of 60.63%. 

Our emphasis on multi-family loans is driven by several factors, including their structure, which reduces our exposure to interest rate volatility to some degree. Another factor driving our focus on multi-family lending has been the comparative quality of the loans we produce. Reflecting the nature of the buildings securing our loans, our underwriting standards, and the generally conservative LTV ratios our multi-family loans feature at origination, a relatively small percentage of the multi-family loans that have transitioned to non-performing status have actually resulted in losses, even when the credit cycle has taken a downward turn. 

We primarily underwrite our multi-family loans based on the current cash flows produced by the collateral property, with a reliance on the &#8220;income&#8221; approach to appraising the properties, rather than the &#8220;sales&#8221; approach. The sales approach is subject to fluctuations in the real estate market, as well as general economic conditions, and is therefore likely to be more risky in the event of a downward credit cycle turn. We also consider a variety of other factors, including the physical condition of the underlying property; the net operating income of the mortgaged premises prior to debt service; the DSCR, which is the ratio of the property&#8217;s net operating income to its debt service; and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value (i.e., the LTV) of the property. 

In addition to requiring a minimum DSCR of 125% on multi-family buildings, we obtain a security interest in the personal property located on the premises, and an assignment of rents and leases. Our multi-family loans generally represent no more than 75% of the lower of the appraised value or the sales price of the underlying property, and typically feature an amortization period of 30 years. In addition, some of our multi-family loans may contain an initial interest-only period which typically does not exceed two years; however, these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis. 

&#160;

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

At September 30, 2022, CRE loans represented $6.6 billion or 13% of total loans and leases held for investment, unchanged compared to the previous quarter. 

The CRE loans originated by the Company are also secured by income-producing properties, such as office buildings, mixed-use buildings (retail storefront on the ground floor and apartment units above the ground floor), retail centers, and multi-tenanted light industrial properties. At September 30, 2022, 83% of our CRE loans were secured by properties in the New York City metro area, while properties in other parts of New York State accounted for 2% of the properties securing our CRE loans and properties in all other states accounted for 15% combined. 

Specialty Finance Loans and Leases 

At September 30, 2022, specialty finance loans and leases totaled $4.3 billion or 9% of total loans and leases held for investment. 

We produce our specialty finance loans and leases through a subsidiary that is staffed by a group of industry veterans with expertise in originating and underwriting senior securitized debt and equipment loans and leases. The subsidiary participates in syndicated loans that are brought to them, and equipment loans and leases that are assigned to them, by a select group of nationally recognized sources, and are generally made to large corporate obligors, many of which are publicly traded, carry investment grade or near-investment grade ratings, and participate in stable industries nationwide. 

The specialty finance loans and leases we fund fall into three categories: asset-based lending, dealer floor-plan lending, and equipment loan and lease financing. Each of these credits is secured with a perfected first security interest in, or outright ownership of, the underlying collateral, and structured as senior debt or as a non-cancelable lease. Asset-based and dealer floor-plan loans are priced at floating rates predominately tied to SOFR or LIBOR-replacement rates, while our equipment financing credits are priced at fixed rates at a spread over Treasuries. 

Since launching our specialty finance business in the third quarter of 2013, no losses have been recorded on any of the loans or leases in this portfolio. 

C&#38;I Loans 

At September 30, 2022, C&#38;I loans totaled $578 million or 1% of total loans and leases held for investment. 

The C&#38;I loans we produce are primarily made to small and mid-size businesses in the five boroughs of New York City and on Long Island. Such loans are tailored to meet the specific needs of our borrowers, and include term loans, demand loans, revolving lines of credit, and, to a much lesser extent, loans that are partly guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. 

A broad range of C&#38;I loans, both collateralized and unsecured, are made available to businesses for working capital (including inventory and accounts receivable), business expansion, the purchase of machinery and equipment, and other general corporate needs. In determining the term and structure of C&#38;I loans, several factors are considered, including the purpose, the collateral, and the anticipated sources of repayment. C&#38;I loans are typically secured by business assets and personal guarantees of the borrower, and include financial covenants to monitor the borrower&#8217;s financial stability. 

The interest rates on our other C&#38;I loans can be fixed or floating, with floating-rate loans being tied to prime or some other market index, plus an applicable spread. Our floating-rate loans may or may not feature a floor rate of interest. The decision to require a floor on other C&#38;I loans depends on the level of competition we face for such loans from other institutions, the direction of market interest rates, and the profitability of our relationship with the borrower. 

Acquisition, Development, and Construction Loans 

ADC loans at September 30, 2022 totaled $203 million and represented 0.41% of total loans and leases held for investment. Because ADC loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk, especially during a downturn in the business cycle, borrowers are required to provide a guarantee of repayment and completion. 

One-to-Four Family Loans 

At September 30, 2022, one-to-four family loans totaled $123 million or 0.25% of total loans and leases held for investment. These loan balances include certain mixed-use CRE with less than five residential units classified as one-to-four family loans. 

&#160;

Other Loans 

Other loans totaled $6 million at September 30, 2022 and consisted mainly of overdraft loans and loans to non-profit organizations. We currently do not offer home equity loans or home equity lines of credit. 

Lending Authority 

The loans we originate for investment are subject to federal and state laws and regulations, and are underwritten in accordance with loan underwriting policies approved by the Management Credit Committee, the Board Credit Committee, and the Board of Directors of the Bank. 

C&#38;I loans less than or equal to $3 million are approved by the joint authority of lending officers. C&#38;I loans in excess of $3 million and all multi-family, CRE, ADC, and Specialty Finance loans regardless of amount are required to be presented to the Management Credit Committee for approval. Multi-family, CRE, and C&#38;I loans in excess of $5 million and Specialty Finance in excess of $15 million are also required to be presented to the Commercial Credit Committee and the Mortgage and Real Estate Committee of the Board, as applicable so that the Committees can review the loan&#8217;s associated risks. The Commercial Credit and Mortgage and Real Estate Committees have authority to direct changes in lending practices as they deem necessary or appropriate in order to address individual or aggregate risks and credit exposures in accordance with the Bank&#8217;s strategic objectives and risk appetites. 

The Board of Directors updated certain aspects of the Company's lending authority as detailed below. These changes were effective as of July 21, 2021. 

Multi-family, CRE, ADC, and specialty finance loans less than or equal to $10 million and C&#38;I loans less than or equal to $5 million are approved by the joint authority of lending officers. C&#38;I loans in excess of $5 million and all multi-family, CRE, ADC, and specialty finance loans in excess of $10 million are required to be presented to the Management Credit Committee for approval. Multi-family, CRE, ADC, and specialty finance loans in excess of $50 million and C&#38;I loans in excess of $10 million are also required to be presented to the Board Credit Committee of the Board, so that the Committee can review the loan&#8217;s associated risks and approve the credit. The Board Credit Committee has authority to direct changes in lending practices as they deem necessary or appropriate in order to address individual or aggregate risks and credit exposures in accordance with the Bank&#8217;s strategic objectives and risk appetites. 

In addition, all loans of $50 million or more originated by the Bank continue to be reported to the Board of Directors. 

At September 30, 2022, the largest mortgage loan in our portfolio was a $329 million multi-family loan collateralized by six properties located in Brooklyn, New York. As of the date of this report, the loan has been current since origination.

A loan generally is classified as a non-accrual loan when it is 90 days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because the Company no longer expects to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, management ceases the accrual of interest owed, and previously accrued interest is charged against interest income. A loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is current and management has reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible. Interest income on non-accrual loans is recorded when received in cash. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, all of our non-performing loans were non-accrual loans. 

We monitor non-accrual loans both within and beyond our primary lending area, which is defined as including: (a) the counties that comprise our CRA Assessment area, and (b) the entirety of the following states: Arizona; Florida; New York; New Jersey; Ohio; and Pennsylvania, in the same manner. Monitoring loans generally involves inspecting and re-appraising the collateral properties; holding discussions with the principals and managing agents of the borrowing entities and/or retained legal counsel, as applicable; requesting financial, operating, and rent roll information; confirming that hazard insurance is in place or force-placing such insurance; monitoring tax payment status and advancing funds as needed; and appointing a receiver, whenever possible, to collect rents, manage the operations, provide information, and maintain the collateral properties. 

It is our policy to order updated appraisals for all non-performing loans, irrespective of loan type, that are collateralized by multi-family buildings, CRE properties, or land, in the event that such a loan is 90 days or more past due, and if the most recent appraisal on file for the property is more than one year old. Appraisals are ordered annually until such time as the loan becomes performing and is returned to accrual status. It is generally not our policy to obtain updated appraisals for performing loans. However, appraisals may be ordered for performing loans when a borrower requests an increase in the loan amount, a modification in loan terms, or an extension of a maturing loan. We do not analyze LTVs on a portfolio-wide basis. 

&#160;

Non-performing loans are reviewed regularly by management and discussed on a monthly basis with the Management Credit Committee, the Board Credit Committee, and the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank, as applicable. Collateral-dependent non-performing loans are written down to their current appraised values, less certain transaction costs. Workout specialists from our Loan Workout Unit actively pursue borrowers who are delinquent in repaying their loans in an effort to collect payment. In addition, outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to institute such action with regard to such borrowers. 

Properties and assets that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as either OREO or repossessed assets, and are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, less the estimated cost of selling the property/asset. Subsequent declines in the fair value of OREO or repossessed assets are charged to earnings and are included in non-interest expense. It is our policy to require an appraisal and an environmental assessment (in accordance with our Environmental Risk Policy) of properties classified as OREO before foreclosure, and to re-appraise the properties/assets on an as-needed basis, and not less than annually, until they are sold. We dispose of such properties/assets as quickly and prudently as possible, given current market conditions and the property&#8217;s or asset&#8217;s condition. 

To mitigate the potential for credit losses, we underwrite our loans in accordance with credit standards that we consider to be prudent. In the case of multi-family and CRE loans, we look first at the consistency of the cash flows being generated by the property to determine its economic value using the &#8220;income approach,&#8221; and then at the market value of the property that collateralizes the loan. The amount of the loan is then based on the lower of the two values, with the economic value more typically used. 

The condition of the collateral property is another critical factor. Multi-family buildings and CRE properties are inspected from rooftop to basement as a prerequisite to closing, with a member of the Board Credit Committee participating in inspections on multi-family, CRE, and ADC loans to be originated in excess of $50 million. We continue to conduct inspections as per the aforementioned policy, however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, currently full access to some properties and buildings may be limited. Furthermore, independent appraisers, whose appraisals are carefully reviewed by our experienced in-house appraisal officers and staff, perform appraisals on collateral properties. In many cases, a second independent appraisal review is performed. 

In addition to underwriting multi-family loans on the basis of the buildings&#8217; income and condition, we consider the borrowers&#8217; credit history, profitability, and building management expertise. Borrowers are required to present evidence of their ability to repay the loan from the buildings&#8217; current rent rolls, their financial statements, and related documents. 

In addition, we work with a select group of mortgage brokers who are familiar with our credit standards and whose track record with our lending officers is typically greater than ten years. Furthermore, in New York City, where the majority of the buildings securing our multi-family loans are located, the rents that tenants may be charged on certain apartments are typically restricted under certain new rent regulation laws. As a result, the rents that tenants pay for such apartments are generally lower than current market rents. Buildings with a preponderance of such rent-regulated apartments are less likely to experience vacancies in times of economic adversity. 

Reflecting the strength of the underlying collateral for these loans and the collateral structure, a relatively small percentage of our non-performing multi-family loans have resulted in losses over time. While our multi-family lending niche has not been immune to downturns in the credit cycle, the limited number of losses we have recorded, even in adverse credit cycles, suggests that the multi-family loans we produce involve less credit risk than certain other types of loans. In general, buildings that are subject to rent regulation have tended to be stable, with occupancy levels remaining more or less constant over time. Because the rents are typically below market and the buildings securing our loans are generally maintained in good condition, they have been more likely to retain their tenants in adverse economic times. In addition, we exclude any short-term property tax exemptions and abatement benefits the property owners receive when we underwrite our multi-family loans. 

To further manage our credit risk, our lending policies limit the amount of credit granted to any one borrower, and typically require minimum DSCRs of 125% for multi-family loans and 130% for CRE loans. Although we typically lend up to 75% of the appraised value on multi-family buildings and up to 65% on commercial properties, the average LTVs of such credits at origination were below those amounts at September 30, 2022. Exceptions to these LTV limitations are minimal and are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 

&#160;

The repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties. To minimize our credit risk, we originate CRE loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards, and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the property&#8217;s current income stream and DSCR. The approval of a loan also depends on the borrower&#8217;s credit history, profitability, and expertise in property management, and generally requires a minimum DSCR of 130% and a maximum LTV of 65%. In addition, the origination of CRE loans typically requires a security interest in the fixtures, equipment, and other personal property of the borrower and/or an assignment of the rents and/or leases. In addition, our CRE loans may contain an interest-only period which typically does not exceed three years; however, these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis. 

Multi-family and CRE loans are generally originated at conservative LTVs and DSCRs, as previously stated. Low LTVs provide a greater likelihood of full recovery and reduce the possibility of incurring a severe loss on a credit; in many cases, they reduce the likelihood of the borrower &#8220;walking away&#8221; from the property. Although borrowers may default on loan payments, they have a greater incentive to protect their equity in the collateral property and to return their loans to performing status. Furthermore, in the case of multi-family loans, the cash flows generated by the properties are generally below-market and have significant value. 

With regard to ADC loans, we typically lend up to 75% of the estimated as-completed market value of multi-family and residential tract projects; however, in the case of home construction loans to individuals, the limit is 80%. With respect to commercial construction loans, we typically lend up to 65% of the estimated as-completed market value of the property. Credit risk is also managed through the loan disbursement process. Loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses, and as warranted by inspection reports provided to us by our own lending officers and/or consulting engineers. 

To minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing, each of our credits is secured with a perfected first security interest or outright ownership in the underlying collateral, and structured as senior debt or as a non-cancellable lease. To further minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing, we re-underwrite each transaction. In addition, we retain outside counsel to conduct a further review of the underlying documentation. 

Other C&#38;I loans are typically underwritten on the basis of the cash flows produced by the borrower&#8217;s business, and are generally collateralized by various business assets, including, but not limited to, inventory, equipment, and accounts receivable. As a result, the capacity of the borrower to repay is substantially dependent on the degree to which the business is successful. Furthermore, the collateral underlying the loan may depreciate over time, may not be conducive to appraisal, and may fluctuate in value, based upon the operating results of the business. Accordingly, personal guarantees are also a normal requirement for other C&#38;I loans. 

The procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories, with late charges assessed, and notices mailed to the borrower, at specified dates. We attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment. When contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property, we attempt to obtain full payment, and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action. Delinquencies are addressed by our Loan Workout Unit and every effort is made to collect rather than initiate foreclosure proceedings.

(1) Does not include any past due taxi medallion-related loans at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

&#160;

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, total loans 30-89 days past due decreased to $39 million compared to $67 million at December 31, 2021, primarily due to two multi-family loans that became current during the nine months ending September 30, 2022. 

Fair values for all multi-family buildings, CRE properties, and land are determined based on the appraised value. If an appraisal is more than one year old and the loan is classified as either non-performing or as an accruing TDR, then an updated appraisal is required to determine fair value. Estimated disposition costs are deducted from the fair value of the property to determine estimated net realizable value. In the instance of an outdated appraisal on an impaired loan, we adjust the original appraisal by using a third-party index value to determine the extent of impairment until an updated appraisal is received. 

While we strive to originate loans that will perform fully, adverse economic and market conditions, among other factors, can adversely impact a borrower&#8217;s ability to repay. 

Based upon all relevant and available information as of the end of the current second quarter, management believes that the allowance for losses on loans was appropriate at that date. 

At September 30, 2022, the Company's three largest NPLs were two CRE loans with balances of $19 million and $8 million and one multi-family loan of $7 million. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

In an effort to proactively manage delinquent loans, we have selectively extended to certain borrowers such concessions as rate reductions and extensions of maturity dates, as well as forbearance agreements, when such borrowers have exhibited financial difficulty. In accordance with GAAP, we are required to account for such loan modifications or restructurings as TDRs. 

The eligibility of a borrower for work-out concessions of any nature depends upon the facts and circumstances of each transaction, which may change from period to period, and involve management&#8217;s judgment regarding the likelihood that the concession will result in the maximum recovery for the Company. 

Loans modified as TDRs are placed on non-accrual status until we determine that future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured. This generally requires that the borrower demonstrate performance according to the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months. At September 30, 2022, non-accrual TDRs included taxi medallion-related loans with a combined balance of $3 million. 

At September 30, 2022, loans on which concessions were made with respect to rate reductions and/or extensions of maturity dates totaled $45 million. 

Based on the number of loans performing in accordance with their revised terms, our success rates for restructured CRE and multi-family loans, was 100%. The success rates for restructured one-to-four family and other loans were 100% and 32%, respectively, at September 30, 2022.

On a limited basis, we may provide additional credit to a borrower after a loan has been placed on non-accrual status or classified as a TDR if, in management&#8217;s judgment, the value of the property after the additional loan funding is greater than the initial value of the property plus the additional loan funding amount. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, no such additions 

&#160;

were made. Furthermore, the terms of our restructured loans typically would not restrict us from cancelling outstanding commitments for other credit facilities to a borrower in the event of non-payment of a restructured loan. 

Except for the non-accrual loans and TDRs disclosed in this filing, we did not have any potential problem loans at the end of the current quarter that would have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of a borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms and that would have resulted in such disclosure if that were the case.

Federal Home Loan Bank Stock 

As a member of the FHLB-NY, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of its capital stock, and to the extent FHLB borrowings are utilized, may further invest in FHLB stock. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Bank held FHLB-NY stock in the amount of $630 million and $734 million, respectively. FHLB-NY stock continued to be valued at par, with no impairment required at that date. 

Dividends from the FHLB-NY to the Bank totaled $9 million and $8 million, respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, and $25 million for both nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. 

Bank-Owned Life Insurance 

BOLI is recorded at the total cash surrender value of the policies in the Consolidated Statements of Condition, and the income generated by the increase in the cash surrender value of the policies is recorded in Non-Interest Income in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Reflecting an increase in the cash surrender value of the underlying policies, our investment in BOLI increased $16 million to $1.2 billion at September 30, 2022 from December 31, 2021. 

Goodwill 

We record goodwill in our Consolidated Statements of Condition in connection with certain of our business combinations. Goodwill, which is tested at least annually for impairment, refers to the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of an acquired company&#8217;s assets, net of the liabilities assumed. Goodwill totaled $2.4 billion at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Sources of Funds 

The Parent Company (i.e., the Company on an unconsolidated basis) has three primary funding sources for the payment of dividends, share repurchases, and other corporate uses: dividends paid to the Company by the Bank; capital raised through the issuance of stock; and funding raised through the issuance of debt instruments. 

On a consolidated basis, our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources: deposits; borrowed funds, primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings; the cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans; and the cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities. 

Loan repayments and sales totaled $9.3 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, up $2.1 billion from the $7.2 billion recorded in the year-earlier nine months. Cash flows from the repayment and sales of securities totaled $571 million and $1.4 billion, respectively, in the corresponding periods, while purchases of securities totaled $2.2 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. 

&#160;

Deposits 

Our ability to retain and attract deposits depends on numerous factors, including customer satisfaction, the rates of interest we pay, the types of products we offer, and the attractiveness of their terms. From time to time, we have chosen not to compete actively for deposits, depending on our access to deposits through acquisitions, the availability of lower-cost funding sources, the impact of competition on pricing, and the need to fund our loan demand. 

As of September 30, 2022, deposits totaled $41.7 billion, up $6.6 billion or 25% annualized compared to December 31, 2021 and up $461 million or 4% annualized compared to June 30, 2022. The strong increase on a year-to-date basis was driven by growth in the Company's BaaS initiative and growth in loan-related deposits. This growth moderated during the current third quarter due to seasonally lower loan growth and the impact of higher market interest rates. 

Our BaaS deposits fall into three verticals: traditional BaaS, consisting primarily of deposits from FinTech companies; banking as a service for governmental agencies, including various municipalities and the U.S. Treasury's prepaid debit card program; and mortgage as a service, catering to mortgage companies, and consisting of escrow deposit accounts for principal, interest payments, and tax payments. At September 30, 2022, traditional BaaS deposits totaled $5.3 billion, government BaaS deposits totaled $579 million, and mortgage as a service deposits totaled $2.0 billion. 

The following table indicates the amount of time deposits, by account, that are in excess of the FDIC insurance limit (currently $250,000) by time remaining until maturity as of September 30, 2022:

Borrowed Funds 

Borrowed funds consist primarily of wholesale borrowings (i.e., FHLB-NY advances, repurchase agreements, and federal funds purchased) and, to a far lesser extent, junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes. At September 30, 2022, total borrowed funds declined $2.8 billion or 22% annualized to $13.8 billion compared to December 31, 2021 and down $509 million compared to June 30, 2022. At September 30, 2022, total borrowings represented 22% of total assets compared to 28% of total assets at December 31, 2021 and 23% of total assets at June 30, 2022. The year-to-date decline was mainly due to a $2.3 billion or 20% annualized decrease in FHLB-NY borrowings to $12.8 billion combined with a $500 million decrease in repurchase agreements to $300 million. The linked-quarter decrease was largely due to the decrease in repurchase agreements. 

Subordinated Notes 

On November 6, 2018, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.90% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2028. The Company has used $286 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase shares of its common stock pursuant to its previously announced share repurchase program, and may use the balance of the offering towards the repurchase of its common stock or for other general corporate purposes. The Notes were offered to the public at 100% of their face amount. At September 30, 2022, the balance of subordinated notes was $297 million, which excludes certain costs related to their issuance. 

Junior Subordinated Debentures 

Junior subordinated debentures totaled $361 million at September 30, 2022, comparable to the balance at December 31, 2021. 

Risk Definitions 

The following section outlines the definitions of interest rate risk, market risk, and liquidity risk, and how the Company manages market and interest rate risk: 

Interest Rate Risk &#8211; Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (re-pricing risk); from changing rate 

&#160;

relationships among different yield curves affecting Company activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related options embedded in a bank&#8217;s products (options risk). The evaluation of interest rate risk must consider the impact of complex, illiquid hedging strategies or products, and also the potential impact on fee income (e.g. prepayment income) which is sensitive to changes in interest rates. In those situations where trading is separately managed, this refers to structural positions and not trading portfolios. 

Market Risk &#8211; Market risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from changes in the value of portfolios of financial instruments. This risk arises from market-making, dealing, and position-taking activities in interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, and commodities markets. Many banks use the term &#8220;price risk&#8221; interchangeably with market risk; this is because market risk focuses on the changes in market factors (e.g., interest rates, market liquidity, and volatilities) that affect the value of traded instruments. The primary accounts affected by market risk are those which are revalued for financial presentation (e.g., trading accounts for securities, derivatives, and foreign exchange products). 

Liquidity Risk &#8211; Liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from a bank&#8217;s inability to meet its obligations when they become due, without incurring unacceptable losses. Liquidity risk includes the inability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources. Liquidity risk also arises from a bank&#8217;s failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value. 

Management of Market and Interest Rate Risk 

We manage our assets and liabilities to reduce our exposure to changes in market interest rates. The asset and liability management process has three primary objectives: to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts; to determine the appropriate level of risk, given our business strategy, risk appetite, operating environment, capital and liquidity requirements, and performance objectives; and to manage that risk in a manner consistent with guidelines approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank. 

Market and Interest Rate Risk 

As a financial institution, we are focused on reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility. Changes in interest rates pose one of the greatest challenges to our financial performance, as such changes can have a significant impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and on the market value of all interest-earning assets, other than those possessing a short term to maturity. To reduce our exposure to changing rates, the Boards of Directors and management monitor interest rate sensitivity on a regular or as needed basis so that adjustments to the asset and liability mix can be made when deemed appropriate. 

The actual duration of held-for-investment mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities can be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment levels and market interest rates. The level of prepayments may be impacted by a variety of factors, including the economy in the region where the underlying mortgages were originated; seasonal factors; demographic variables; and the assumability of the underlying mortgages. However, the largest determinants of prepayments are interest rates and the availability of refinancing opportunities. 

We manage our interest rate risk by taking the following actions: continue to emphasize the origination and retention of intermediate-term assets, primarily in the form of multi-family and CRE loans; continue to originate certain floating rate C&#38;I loans; depending on funding needs, replace maturing wholesale borrowings with longer term borrowings; and as needed, execute interest rate swaps. 

LIBOR Transition Process 

The discontinuation of LIBOR has been developing since 2017 when the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) first called for LIBOR to be phased out by 2021. The ICE Benchmark Administration, the publisher of LIBOR discontinued publication of the one-week and two-month US Dollar LIBOR on December 31, 2021, and will discontinue publication of overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and twelve-month US Dollar LIBORs on June 30, 2023, although its use for new business was restricted after December 31, 2021, with limited exceptions. 

&#160;

In October 2020, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association announced fallback language for derivative contracts incorporating SOFR, as well as a process by which counterparties to such contracts could elect to apply the fallback language to existing derivatives on or after January 25, 2021. SOFR was identified by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a group of private-market participants convened to help ensure a successful transition from LIBOR in the United States, as the recommended replacement to US Dollar LIBOR in the United States. The adoption of the fallback protocols does not change the index for subject agreements from LIBOR to SOFR, but simply creates the legal framework for the appropriate mechanisms to occur in the future. 

The Bank established a sub-committee of ALCO to address issues related to the phase out and transition away from LIBOR. The sub-committee is led by our Chief Financial Officer and consists of personnel from various departments throughout the Bank. The Company has identified certain LIBOR-based contracts that extend beyond June 30, 2023, which may include loans and leases, securities, wholesale borrowings, derivative financial instruments, and long-term debt. The sub-committee has reviewed the associated contracts and legal agreements for conformance to the ARRC aligned fallback language and noted that certain contracts will require some form of standardization in accordance with LIBOR transition recommended fallback provisions. 

The FRB, the FDIC, and the OCC issued supervisory guidance encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. In accordance with guidance, as of after December 31, 2021 the Bank does not offer LIBOR indexed products. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis 

The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are &#8220;interest rate sensitive&#8221; and by monitoring a bank&#8217;s interest rate sensitivity &#8220;gap.&#8221; An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time frame if it will mature or reprice within that period of time. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time frame and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same period of time. 

In a rising interest rate environment, an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected, absent the effects of other factors, to experience a greater increase in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities than it would in the yield on its interest-earning assets, thus producing a decline in its net interest income. Conversely, in a declining rate environment, an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected to experience a lesser reduction in the yield on its interest-earning assets than it would in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities, thus producing an increase in its net interest income. 

In a rising interest rate environment, an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a greater increase in the yield on its interest-earning assets than it would in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities, thus producing an increase in its net interest income. Conversely, in a declining rate environment, an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a lesser reduction in the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities than it would in the yield on its interest-earning assets, thus producing a decline in its net interest income. 

At September 30, 2022, our one-year gap was a negative 26.11%, compared to a negative 7.43% at December 31, 2021. The change in our one-year gap from December 31, 2021, primarily reflects an increase in borrowings that will mature or are projected to get put back to the Company and an increase in new deposit balances that are indexed to short term rates. 

The table on the following page sets forth the amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at September 30, 2022 which, based on certain assumptions stemming from our historical experience, are expected to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except as stated below, the amounts of assets and liabilities shown as repricing or maturing during a particular time period were determined in accordance with the earlier of (1) the term to repricing, or (2) the contractual terms of the asset or liability. 

The table provides an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at September 30, 2022 on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments, and scheduled rate adjustments within a three-month period and subsequent selected time intervals. For residential mortgage-related securities, prepayment rates are forecasted at a weighted average CPR of 7.16% per annum; for multi-family and CRE loans, prepayment rates are forecasted at weighted average CPRs of 7.39% and 6.82% per annum, respectively. Borrowed funds were not assumed to prepay. 

Savings, interest bearing checking and money market accounts were assumed to decay based on a comprehensive statistical analysis that incorporated our historical deposit experience. Based on the results of this analysis, savings accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of 60% for the first five years and 40% for years six through ten. Interest-bearing checking accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of 86% for the first five years and 14% for years six through ten. The decay assumptions reflect the prolonged low 

&#160;

interest rate environment and the uncertainty regarding future depositor behavior. Including those accounts having specified repricing dates, money market accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of 80% for the first five years and 20% for years six through ten.

(1) For the purpose of the gap analysis, loans held for sale, non-performing loans and the allowances for loan losses have been excluded. 

(2) Mortgage-related and other securities, including FHLB stock, are shown at their respective carrying amounts. 

(3) Expected amount based, in part, on historical experience. 

(4) The interest rate sensitivity gap per period represents the difference between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Prepayment and deposit decay rates can have a significant impact on our estimated gap. While we believe our assumptions to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that the assumed prepayment and decay rates will approximate actual future loan and securities prepayments and deposit withdrawal activity. 

To validate our prepayment assumptions for our multi-family and CRE loan portfolios, we perform a quarterly analysis, during which we review our historical prepayment rates and compare them to our projected prepayment rates. We continually review the actual prepayment rates to ensure that our projections are as accurate as possible, since prepayments on these types of loans are not as closely correlated to changes in interest rates as prepayments on one-to-four family loans tend to be. In addition, we review the call provisions, if any, in our borrowings and investment portfolios and, on a monthly basis, compare the actual calls to our projected calls to ensure that our projections are reasonable. 

As of September 30, 2022, the impact of a 100 bp decline in market interest rates would have increased our projected prepayment rates for multi-family and CRE loans by a constant prepayment rate of 0.81% per annum. 

Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of the market, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Furthermore, in the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in calculating the table. Also, the ability of some borrowers to repay their adjustable-rate loans may be adversely impacted by an increase in market interest rates. 

&#160;

Interest rate sensitivity is also monitored through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in our Economic Value of Equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The EVE ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the EVE in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The model assumes estimated loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates, and deposit decay rates similar to those utilized in formulating the preceding Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis. 

Based on the information and assumptions in effect at September 30, 2022, the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in our EVE, assuming the changes in interest rates noted:

&#160;

The net changes in EVE presented in the preceding table are within the limits approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank. 

As with the Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the preceding interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in EVE requires that certain assumptions be made which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the EVE Analysis presented above assumes that the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured, and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve, regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Furthermore, the model does not consider the benefit of any strategic actions we may take to further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk. Accordingly, while the EVE Analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income, and may very well differ from actual results. 

We also utilize an internal net interest income simulation to manage our sensitivity to interest rate risk. The simulation incorporates various market-based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on future levels of our financial assets and liabilities. The assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the following table, due to the frequency, timing, and magnitude of changes in interest rates; changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories; and prepayments, among other factors, coupled with any actions taken to counter the effects of any such changes. 

Based on the information and assumptions in effect at September 30, 2022, the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in future net interest income for the next twelve months, assuming the changes in interest rates noted:

&#160;

(1) In general, short- and long-term rates are assumed to increase in parallel fashion across all four quarters and then remain unchanged. 

Future changes in our mix of assets and liabilities may result in greater changes to our gap, NPV, and/or net interest income simulation. 

&#160;

In the event that our EVE and net interest income sensitivities were to breach our internal policy limits, we would undertake the following actions to ensure that appropriate remedial measures were put in place: 

&#8226; Our ALCO Committee would inform the Board of Directors of the variance, and present recommendations to the Board regarding proposed courses of action to restore conditions to within-policy tolerances. 

&#8226; In formulating appropriate strategies, the ALCO Committee would ascertain the primary causes of the variance from policy tolerances, the expected term of such conditions, and the projected effect on capital and earnings. 

Where temporary changes in market conditions or volume levels result in significant increases in risk, strategies may involve reducing open positions or employing synthetic hedging techniques to more immediately reduce risk exposure. Where variance from policy tolerances is triggered by more fundamental imbalances in the risk profiles of core loan and deposit products, a remedial strategy may involve restoring balance through natural hedges to the extent possible before employing synthetic hedging techniques. Other strategies might include: 

&#8226; Asset restructuring, involving sales of assets having higher risk profiles, or a gradual restructuring of the asset mix over time to affect the maturity or repricing schedule of assets; 

&#8226; Liability restructuring, whereby product offerings and pricing are altered or wholesale borrowings are employed to affect the maturity structure or repricing of liabilities; 

&#8226; Expansion or shrinkage of the balance sheet to correct imbalances in the repricing or maturity periods between assets and liabilities; and/or 

&#8226; Use or alteration of off-balance sheet positions, including interest rate swaps, caps, floors, options, and forward purchase or sales commitments. 

In connection with our net interest income simulation modeling, we also evaluate the impact of changes in the slope of the yield curve. At September 30, 2022, our analysis indicated that an immediate inversion of the yield curve would be expected to result in a 5.66% decrease in net interest income; conversely, an immediate steepening of the yield curve would be expected to result in a 22.10% increase in net interest income. It should be noted that the yield curve changes in these scenarios were updated, given the changing market rate environment, which resulted in an increase in the income sensitivity in the steepening scenario. 

Liquidity, Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Capital Position 

Liquidity 

We manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations, and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand. 

We monitor our liquidity daily to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet our financial obligations. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. As in the past, our loan and securities portfolios provided meaningful liquidity in 2022, with cash flows from the repayment and sale of loans totaling $9.3 billion and cash flows from the repayment and sale of securities totaling $571 million. 

Additional liquidity stems from deposits and from our use of wholesale funding sources, including brokered deposits and wholesale borrowings. In addition, we have access to the Bank&#8217;s approved lines of credit with various counterparties, including the FHLB-NY. The availability of these wholesale funding sources is generally based on the amount of mortgage loan collateral available under a blanket lien we have pledged to the respective institutions and, to a lesser extent, the amount of available securities that may be pledged to collateralize our borrowings. At September 30, 2022, our available borrowing capacity with the FHLB-NY was $12.2 billion. In addition, the Bank had available-for-sale securities of $6.7 billion, of which, $6.1 billion is unpledged. 

Furthermore, the Bank has agreements with the FRB-NY that enable it to access the discount window as a further means of enhancing their liquidity. In connection with these agreements, the Bank has pledged certain loans and securities to collateralize any funds they may borrow. At September 30, 2022, the maximum amount the Bank could borrow from the FRB-NY was $1.1 billion. There were no borrowings against these lines of credit at September 30, 2022. 

&#160;

Our primary investing activity is loan production, and the volume of loans we originated for investment totaled $12.6 billion in 2022. During this time, the net cash used in investing activities totaled $4.7 billion; the net cash provided by our operating activities totaled $631 million. Our financing activities provided net cash of $3.6 billion. 

CDs due to mature or reprice in one year or less from September 30, 2022 totaled $6.8 billion, representing 75% of total CDs at that date. Our ability to attract and retain retail deposits, including CDs, depends on numerous factors, including, among others, the convenience of our branches and our other banking channels; our customers&#8217; satisfaction with the service they receive; the rates of interest we offer; the types of products we feature; and the attractiveness of their terms. 

Our decision to compete for deposits also depends on numerous factors, including, among others, our access to deposits through acquisitions, the availability of lower-cost funding sources, the impact of competition on pricing, and the need to fund our loan demand. 

The Parent Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases, the Parent Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to our stockholders. As a Delaware corporation, the Parent Company is able to pay dividends either from surplus or, in case there is no surplus, from net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. 

The Parent Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends may also depend, in part, upon dividends it receives from the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends and other capital distributions to the Parent Company is generally limited by New York State Banking Law and regulations, and by certain regulations of the FDIC. In addition, the Superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services (the &#8220;Superintendent&#8221;), the FDIC, and the FRB, for reasons of safety and soundness, may prohibit the payment of dividends that are otherwise permissible by regulations. 

Under New York State Banking Law, a New York State-chartered stock-form savings bank or commercial bank may declare and pay dividends out of its net profits, unless there is an impairment of capital. However, the approval of the Superintendent is required if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of a bank&#8217;s net profits for that year, combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years. In 2022, the Bank paid dividends totaling $250 million to the Parent Company, leaving $675 million that it could dividend to the Parent Company without regulatory approval at year-end. Additional sources of liquidity available to the Parent Company at September 30, 2022 included $104 million in cash and cash equivalents. If the Bank was to apply to the Superintendent for approval to make a dividend or capital distribution in excess of the dividend amounts permitted under the regulations, there can be no assurance that such application would be approved. 

&#160;

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Commitments 

In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of contractual obligations in order to manage our assets and liabilities, fund loan growth, operate our branch network, and address our capital needs. 

For example, we offer CDs with contractual terms to our customers, and borrow funds under contract from the FHLB-NY and various brokerage firms. These contractual obligations are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Condition under &#8220;Deposits&#8221; and &#8220;Borrowed funds,&#8221; respectively. At September 30, 2022, we had CDs of $9.1 billion and long-term debt (defined as borrowed funds with an original maturity one year or more) of $10.3 billion. 

At September 30, 2022, we also had commitments to extend credit in the form of mortgage and other loan originations, as well as commercial, performance stand-by, and financial stand-by letters of credit, totaling $5.2 billion. These off-balance sheet commitments consist of agreements to extend credit, as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract under which the loan is made. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. 

The letters of credit we issue consist of performance stand-by, financial stand-by, and commercial letters of credit. Financial stand-by letters of credit primarily are issued for the benefit of other financial institutions, municipalities, or landlords on behalf of certain of our current borrowers, and obligate us to guarantee payment of a specified financial obligation. Performance stand-by letters of credit are primarily issued for the benefit of local municipalities on behalf of certain of our borrowers. Performance letters of credit obligate us to make payments in the event that a specified third party fails to perform under non-financial contractual obligations. Commercial letters of credit act as a means of ensuring payment to a seller upon shipment of goods to a buyer. Although commercial letters of credit are used to effect payment for domestic transactions, the majority are used to settle payments in international trade. Typically, such letters of credit require the presentation of documents that describe the commercial transaction, and provide evidence of shipment and the transfer of title. The fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in &#8220;Fee income&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 

&#160;

Based upon our current liquidity position, we expect that our funding will be sufficient to fulfill these cash obligations and commitments when they are due both in the short term and long term. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2022, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

At September 30, 2022, we had no commitments to purchase securities. 

Capital Position 

On March 17, 2017, we issued 515,000 shares of preferred stock. The offering generated capital of $503 million, net of underwriting and other issuance costs, for general corporate purposes, with the bulk of the proceeds being distributed to the Bank. 

On October 24, 2018, the Company announced that it had received regulatory approval to repurchase its common stock. Accordingly, the Board of Directors approved a $300 million common share repurchase program. The repurchase program was funded through the issuance of a like amount of subordinated notes. As of September 30, 2022, the Company has repurchased a total of 29.7 million shares at an average price of $9.61 or an aggregate purchase price of $286 million, leaving $9 million remaining under the current authorization. 

Stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, and tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity include AOCL, which decreased $517 million from the balance at the end of last year and $510 million from the year-ago quarter to $602 million at September 30, 2022. The year-to-date decrease was primarily the result of a $567 million decrease in the net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities, net of tax, and a $49 million change in the net unrealized gain (loss) on cash flow hedges, net of tax, to $40 million. 

Regulatory Capital 

The Bank is subject to regulation, examination, and supervision by the NYSDFS and the FDIC (the &#8220;Regulators&#8221;). The Bank is also governed by numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, which established five categories of capital adequacy ranging from &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; to &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; Such classifications are used by the FDIC to determine various matters, including prompt corrective action and each institution&#8217;s FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to the Regulators&#8217; qualitative judgments about the components of capital and risk weightings, among other factors. 

The quantitative measures established to ensure capital adequacy require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of leverage capital to average assets and of common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital, and total capital to risk-weighted assets (as such measures are defined in the regulations). At September 30, 2022, our capital measures continued to exceed the minimum federal requirements for a bank holding company and for a bank. The following table sets forth our common equity tier 1, tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based, and leverage capital amounts and ratios on a consolidated basis and for the Bank on a stand-alone basis, as well as the respective minimum regulatory capital requirements, at that date:

At September 30, 2022, our total risk-based capital ratio exceeded the minimum requirement for capital adequacy purposes by 406 bps and the fully-phased in capital conservation buffer by 156 bps. 

&#160;

The Bank also exceeded the minimum capital requirements to be categorized as &#8220;Well Capitalized.&#8221; To be categorized as well capitalized, a bank must maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 ratio of 6.50%; a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.00%; a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 10.00%; and a minimum leverage capital ratio of 5.00%. 

Earnings Summary for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 

For the three months ended September 30, 2022, net income totaled $152 million, up 2% compared to $149 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. Net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $144 million, up 3% compared to $140 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. Diluted EPS were $0.30 for the three months ended September 30, 2022, unchanged compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021. Both net income and net income available to common stockholders include $3 million of merger-related expenses, net of income taxes, while the three months ended September 30, 2021 contain merger-related expenses of $5 million, net of income taxes. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is our primary source of income. Its level is a function of the average balance of our interest-earning assets, the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by various external factors, including the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FOMC, and market interest rates. 

Net interest income is also influenced by the level of prepayment income primarily generated in connection with the prepayment of our multi-family and CRE loans, as well as securities. Since prepayment income is recorded as interest income, an increase or decrease in its level will also be reflected in the average yields (as applicable) on our loans, securities, and interest-earning assets, and therefore in our interest rate spread and net interest margin. 

It should be noted that the level of prepayment income on loans recorded in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay during that time. Such activity is largely dependent on such external factors as current market conditions, including real estate values, and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates. In addition, while a decline in market interest rates may trigger an increase in refinancing and, therefore, prepayment income, so too may an increase in market interest rates. It is not unusual for borrowers to lock in lower interest rates when they expect, or see, that market interest rates are rising rather than risk refinancing later at a still higher interest rate. 

Year-Over-Year Comparison 

For the three months ended September 30, 2022, net interest income increased $8 million or 3% to $326 million on a year-over-year basis, but decreased $33 million or 9% on a linked-quarter basis. While interest income rose on a year-over-year basis, the aggressive pace of interest rate increases during the past quarter led to a significant increase in interest expense. This was due to both an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities along with a higher cost of funds. 

Details of the change in net interest income are as follows: 

&#8226; Total interest income increased $94 million or 23% to $509 million on a year-over-year basis. This was primarily due to growth in average loan balances, along with higher yields and growth in average securities. 

&#160;

&#8226; Total interest expense almost doubled on a year-over-year basis, increasing $86 million or 89% to $183 million compared to $97 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase was due to both an increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and in the cost of funds. 

&#8226; Average loans increased $5.3 billion or 12% on a year-over-year basis to $48.5 billion, while the average loan yield rose 16 basis points to 3.64%. 

&#8226; Average securities balances rose $711 million or 11% on a year-over-year basis to $7.4 billion as the Company redeployed a portion of its cash balances into short-term securities. During the same time period, the average yield on securities rose 53 basis points to 2.74%. 

&#8226; Interest expense on average interest-bearing deposits increased $84 million to $110 million on a year-over-year basis as the average balance of interest-bearing deposits rose $7.7 billion or 26% to $37.2 billion while the average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 83 basis points to 1.18%. 

&#8226; Most of the increase was in the interest-bearing checking and MMA category. Average interest-bearing checking and MMA balances increased $6.7 billion or 52% on a year-over-year basis to $19.4 billion. The average cost of these deposits increased 124 basis points to 1.47%. 

&#8226; Interest expense on average borrowed funds increased $2 million on a year-over-year basis to $73 million. While average borrowings declined 7% to $14.5 billion, the average cost rose 16 basis points to 2.00%. 

&#8226; Average non-interesting bearing deposits declined $425 million or 10% to $4.0 billion. 

Net Interest Margin 

For the three months ended September 30, 2022, the NIM declined 30 basis points to 2.22% compared to the previous quarter and declined 22 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2021. 

Prepayment income contributed seven basis points to the third quarter 2022 NIM, compared to 14 basis points in the previous quarter and 12 basis points in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact from prepayment income, the third-quarter 2022 NIM on a non-GAAP basis was 2.15%, down 23 basis points compared to the previous quarter and down 17 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter. 

The following table summarizes the contribution of loan and securities prepayment income on the Company&#8217;s interest income and NIM for the respective periods:

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our average balance sheet for the three-month periods, including the average yields on our interest-earning assets and the average costs of our interest-bearing liabilities. Average yields are calculated by dividing the interest income produced by the average balance of interest-earning assets. Average costs are calculated by dividing the interest expense produced by the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average balances for the quarters are derived from average balances that are calculated daily. The average yields and costs include fees, as well as premiums and discounts (including mark-to-market adjustments from acquisitions), that are considered adjustments to such average yields and costs.

Provision for (Recovery of) Credit Losses 

For the three months ended September 30, 2022, the provision for credit losses totaled $2 million compared to a recovery of credit losses of $1 million in the year-ago quarter and $9 million in the previous quarter of 2022. During the current third quarter, we recorded net charge-offs of zero, unchanged compared to the year-ago quarter and compared to a $7 million net recovery during second-quarter 2022. 

For additional information about our provisions for and recoveries of loan losses, see the discussion of the allowances for loan losses under &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; and the discussion of &#8220;Asset Quality&#8221; that appear earlier in this report. 

&#160;

Non-Interest Income 

We generate non-interest income through a variety of sources, including&#8212;among others&#8212;fee income (in the form of retail deposit fees and charges on loans); income from our investment in BOLI; gains on the sale of securities; and revenues produced through the sale of third-party investment products. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2022, non-interest income totaled $17 million, up $2 million or 13% compared to the third quarter of 2021, but down $1 million or 6% compared to the second quarter of 2022. The current third quarter includes net losses on securities of $1 million compared to no such net gains or losses on securities in either the prior-quarter or the year-ago quarter. The prior quarter included a $1.7 million gain on the sale of the Company's former headquarters building in Westbury, N.Y. 

The following table summarizes our non-interest income for the respective periods:

Non-Interest Expense 

For the three months ended September 30, 2022, total non-interest expenses were $136 million, up 1% compared to the $135 million reported for the three months ended September 30, 2021, but down 1% compared to the $138 million reported during the three months ended June 30, 2022. Included in the current third quarter are $4 million in merger-related expenses, unchanged compared to second-quarter 2022, but down 33% compared to $6 million during the third-quarter 2021. Excluding this item, total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were $132 million, down $2 million or 1% compared to the previous quarter, but up $3 million or 2% compared to the year-ago quarter. The efficiency ratio during the current third quarter was 38.57% compared to 35.57% during second-quarter 2022 and 38.84% during the year-ago third quarter. 

Income Tax Expense 

For the three months ended September 30, 2022, income tax expense totaled $53 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 25.66% compared to income tax expense of $59 million with an effective tax rate of 25.60% in the previous quarter and income tax expense of $50 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 25.19% in the year-ago quarter. The linked-quarter decrease in our income tax expense was driven primarily by a lower amount of pre-tax income. 

Earnings Summary for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, net income totaled $478 million, up 7% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Net income available to common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 totaled $453 million, up 8% compared to $421 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Diluted EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 were $0.96, up 7% compared to $0.90 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Included in both nine month periods are merger-related expenses and other one-time items of $11 million, net of income taxes and $15 million net of income taxes, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

&#160;

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $1.0 billion compared to $967 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, up 5%. The year-over-year increase was driven by a $142 million or 11% increase in total interest income to $1.4 billion, partially offset by a $92 million or 30% increase in total interest expense. 

Details of the change in net interest income are as follows: 

&#8226; Average interest-earnings assets increased $4.7 billion or 9% to $56.7 billion, while the average yield on interest-earnings assets rose seven basis points to 3.32%. 

&#160;

&#8226; Average interest-bearing liabilities grew $4.6 billion or 10% to $49.7 billion, while the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 16 basis points to 1.06%. 

&#8226; Interest income on average loans increased $114 million or 10% to $1.3 billion, driven by a $4.3 billion or 10% increase in average loan balances, while the average yield was unchanged at 3.56%. 

&#8226; Average securities balances rose 3% to $6.9 billion and the average yield increased five basis points to 2.43%. 

&#8226; Interest expense on average deposits increased $96 million or 110% to $183 million, while the average cost of deposits increased 31 basis points to 0.71%. 

&#8226; The majority of the increase in interest expense on deposits was in the interest-bearing checking and MMA category. The average balance of interest-bearing checking and MMA rose $4.2 billion or 33% to $16.9 billion. The average cost of these deposits increased 57 basis points to 0.82%. 

&#8226; Interest expense on average borrowed funds was down $4 million to $211 million due to a $404 million or 3% decline in average balances and a one basis point increase in the average cost to 1.84%. 

&#160;

Net Interest Margin 

For the nine months ended September 20, 2022, the NIM was 2.39%, down nine basis points compared to 2.48% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Prepayment income totaled $42 million compared to $63 million in the year-ago period, and contributed 10 basis points to the NIM compared to 16 basis points in the year-ago period. Excluding the impact from prepayment income, the NIM, on a non-GAAP basis was 2.29% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, down three basis points compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our average balance sheet for the six-month periods, including the 

average yields on our interest-earning assets and the average costs of our interest-bearing liabilities. Average yields are calculated by dividing the interest income produced by the average balance of interest-earning assets. Average costs are calculated by dividing the interest expense produced by the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average balances for the quarters are derived from average balances that are calculated daily. The average yields and costs include fees, as well as premiums and discounts (including mark-to-market adjustments from acquisitions), that are considered adjustments to such average yields and costs.
