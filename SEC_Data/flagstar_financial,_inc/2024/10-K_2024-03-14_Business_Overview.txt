 Item 1. Business ##TABLE_END

General 

New York Community Bancorp, Inc., (on a stand-alone basis, the &#8220;Parent Company&#8221; or, collectively with its subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is the bank holding company for Flagstar Bank, N.A. (hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). The Company went public in 1993 and has grown organically and through a series of accretive mergers and acquisitions. Effective as of December 1, 2022, in connection with the Parent Company&#8217;s acquisition of Flagstar Bancorp, (i) Flagstar Bank, FSB converted to a national bank to be known as &#8220;Flagstar Bank, N.A.&#8221; and (ii) New York Community Bank was merged with and into Flagstar Bank N.A., with Flagstar Bank N.A. continuing as the surviving entity. 

New York Community Bancorp, Inc. has market-leading positions in several national businesses, including multi-family lending, mortgage originations and servicing, and warehouse lending. The Company is the 2nd largest multi-family portfolio lender in the country and the leading multi-family portfolio lender in the New York City market area, where it specializes in rent-regulated, non-luxury apartment buildings. Flagstar Mortgage is the 7th largest bank originator of residential mortgages for the 12-months ended December 31, 2023, while we are the industry&#8217;s 5th largest sub-servicer of mortgage loans nationwide, servicing 1.4 million accounts with $382.2 billion in unpaid principal balances as of December 31, 2023. Additionally, the Company is the 2nd largest mortgage warehouse lender nationally based on total commitments.

The content of our website shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. 

Our Market 

Flagstar Bank, N.A. operates 420 branches including strong footholds in the Northeast and Midwest and exposure to high growth markets in the Southeast and West Coast. Flagstar Mortgage operates nationally through a wholesale network of approximately 3,000 third-party mortgage originators. In addition, the Bank has 134 private banking teams located in over 10 cities in the metropolitan New York City region and on the West Coast, which serve the needs of high-net worth individuals and their businesses. 

The market for the loans we produce varies, depending on the type of loan. For example, the vast majority of our multi-family loans are collateralized by rental apartment buildings in New York City, while the majority of the properties collateralizing our CRE and ADC loans are located in the Northeast and Midwest. Our specialty finance loans and leases are generally made to large corporate obligors that participate in stable industries nationwide and our warehouse loans are made to mortgage lenders across the country. 

Competition for Deposits 

We compete for deposits and customers by placing an emphasis on convenience and service and, from time to time, by offering specific products at competitive rates. In addition to our 420 branches , we have 385 ATM locations that operate 24 hours a day . Our customers also have 24-hour access to their accounts through our mobile banking app, online through our website, www.flagstar.com , or through our bank-by-phone service. We also offer certain money market accounts, certificates of deposit and checking accounts through a dedicated website: www.myBankingDirect.com. 

In addition to checking and savings accounts, retirement accounts, and CDs for both businesses and consumers, we offer a suite of cash management products to address the needs of small and mid-size businesses and professional associations. We also compete by complementing our broad selection of traditional banking products with an extensive menu of non-deposit investment products and insurance through a relationship with a third-party broker dealer and insurance agency. 

Our ability to attract and retain deposits is not only a function of short-term interest rates and industry consolidation, but also the competitiveness of the rates being offered by other financial institutions within our marketplace, including credit unions, online banks, and brokerage firms. Additionally, financial technology companies, also referred to as FinTechs, are providing nontraditional, but increasingly strong competition for deposits and customers. 

Competition for deposits is also influenced by several internal factors, including the opportunity to assume or acquire deposits through business combinations; the cash flows produced through loan and securities repayments and sales; and the availability of attractively priced wholesale funds. In addition, the degree to which we seek to compete for deposits is influenced by the liquidity needed to fund our loan production and other outstanding commitments. 

Competition for Commercial and Consumer Loans and Servicing 

Our success as a lender is substantially tied to the economic health of the markets where we lend. Local economic conditions have a significant impact on loan demand, the value of the collateral securing our credits, and the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. 

The competition we face for loans also varies with the type of loan we are originating. In New York City, where the majority of the buildings collateralizing our multi-family loans are located, we compete for such loans on the basis of timely service and the expertise that stems from being a specialist in this lending niche. In addition to the money center, regional, and local banks we compete with in this market, we compete with insurance companies and other types of lenders. Certain of the banks we compete with sell the loans they produce to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

Our ability to compete for CRE loans depends on the same factors that impact our ability to compete for multi-family credits, and the degree to which other CRE lenders choose to offer loan products similar to ours. 

Competition for our specialty finance loans, which consist primarily of asset-based, equipment financing, and dealer floor plan loans, is driven by a variety of factors, including prevailing economic conditions and the level of interest rates. Moreover, since a majority of our customers in this category are mid-to-large size publicly traded companies, we also face competition for financing from the capital markets. In addition, the majority of specialty finance loans that we originate are sourced from larger financial institutions who have many customers for these loans. Some of these customers are larger and have more capital and liquidity than the Company. 

From a lending perspective, we compete with many institutions including commercial banks, national mortgage lenders, local savings banks, financial technology companies, credit unions and commercial lenders offering mortgage loans and other consumer loans. 

In servicing, we compete primarily against non-bank servicers. The subservicing market in which we operate is also highly competitive and we face competition related to subservicing pricing and service delivery. We compete by offering quality servicing, a robust risk and compliance infrastructure and a model where our mortgage business allows for recapture services to replenish loans for subservicing clients. 

Monetary Policy 

The Company and the Bank are affected by fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, including those of the FRB which regulates the national money supply in order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures. Among the techniques available to the FRB are engaging in open market transactions of U.S. Government securities, changing the discount rate and changing reserve requirements against bank deposits. These techniques are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits. Their use may also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The effect of government policies on the earnings of the Company and the Bank cannot be predicted. 

Environmental Issues 

We encounter certain environmental risks in our lending activities and other operations. The existence of hazardous materials may make it unattractive for a lender to foreclose on the properties securing its loans. In addition, under certain conditions, lenders may become liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous materials found on such properties. We attempt to mitigate such environmental risks by requiring either that a borrower purchase environmental insurance or that an appropriate environmental site assessment be completed as part of our underwriting review on the initial granting of CRE and ADC loans, regardless of location, and of any out-of-state multi-family loans we may produce. Depending on the results of an assessment, appropriate measures are taken to address the identified risks. In addition, we order an updated environmental analysis prior to foreclosing on such properties, and typically hold foreclosed multi-family, CRE, and ADC properties in subsidiaries. 

Our attention to environmental risks also applies to the properties and facilities that house our bank operations. Prior to acquiring a large-scale property, a Phase 1 Environmental Property Assessment is typically performed by a licensed professional engineer to determine the integrity of, and/or the potential risk associated with, the facility and the property on which it is built. Properties and facilities of a smaller scale are evaluated by qualified in-house assessors, as well as by industry experts in environmental testing and remediation. This two-pronged approach identifies potential risks associated with asbestos-containing material, above and underground storage tanks, radon, electrical transformers (which may contain PCBs), ground water flow, storm and sanitary discharge, and mold, among other environmental risks. These processes assist us in mitigating environmental risk by enabling us to identify and address potential issues, including by avoiding taking ownership or control of contaminated properties. 

Subsidiary Activities 

We conduct business primarily through our wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Flagstar Bank, N.A. The Bank has formed, or acquired through merger transactions, 39 active subsidiaries. Of these, 26 are direct subsidiaries of the Bank and 13 are subsidiaries of Bank-owned entities. The Parent Company also has four direct subsidiaries (including Flagstar Bank, N.A). NYB Realty Holding Company, LLC, a subsidiary of the Bank, owns interests in 10 additional active entities organized as indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries to own interests in various real estate properties. 

The Parent Company owns special business trusts that were formed for the purpose of issuing capital and common securities and investing the proceeds thereof in the junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. See Note 12 - Borrowed Funds, in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,&#8221; for a further discussion of the Company&#8217;s special business trusts. The Parent Company also has one non-banking subsidiary that was established in connection with the acquisition of Atlantic Bank of New York and two non-banking insurance subsidiaries that were acquired in connection with the Flagstar acquisition. 

Human Capital Management 

At December 31, 2023, our workforce included 8,766 employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe our employee relations to be in good standing. 

We believe our employees are among our most significant resources and that our employees are critical to our continued success. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations. We pay our employees competitively and offer a broad range of benefits, both of which we believe are competitive with our industry peers and with other firms in the locations in which we do business. Our employees receive salaries that are subject to annual review and periodic benchmarking. Our benefits program includes a 401(k) Plan with an employer matching contribution, healthcare and other insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts and paid time off. Many of our employees are also eligible to participate in the Company&#8217;s equity award program and the Company's annual incentive program. 

We are proud to strive to maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce that reflects the demographics of the communities in which we do business. Our company recognizes that the talents of a diverse workforce are a key competitive advantage. To increase diversity within our talent pool, we work with key stakeholders in our business locations to deepen our understanding of the local labor market and better position the organization to recruit and retain talent within under-represented communities. 

We strive to create and foster a supportive environment for all of our employees, and we are proud to share our business success with individuals whose cultural and personal differences support an innovative and productive workplace. Approximately two-thirds of our workforce is female and nearly half of our workforce have diverse ethnic backgrounds. Our policies and practices reflect our commitment to diversity and inclusion in the workplace. 

A diverse workforce is critical to our long-term success. We strive to build and leverage a diverse, inclusive and engaged workforce that inspires all individuals to work together towards a common goal of superior business results by embracing the unique needs and objectives of our customers and community. We strive to achieve this by hiring great people who represent the talents, experiences, background and diversity of the communities we serve. Our commitment is reflected in the policies that govern our workforce, such as our Diversity Pledge and our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy, and is evidenced in our recruiting strategies, diversity and inclusion training and Employee resource groups, which are key to our efforts. Our Employee resource groups provide our associates access to coaching, mentoring and professional development. As of December 31, 2023, our efforts have been focused on the following eleven employee resource groups which we intend to expand across our recently combined Company: African American, Asian-Indian, Environmental, Hispanic/Latino, Interfaith, LGBTQ, Military Veterans, Native American, People with Disabilities, Women and Young Professionals. 

Our management teams and all of our employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and all employees are required to complete annual training that focuses on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of unlawful discrimination. 

Federal, State, and Local Taxation 

The Company is subject to federal, state, and local income taxes. See the discussion of "Income Taxes" in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Regulation and Supervision 

The following is a brief summary of certain statutes and regulations that significantly affect the Company and its subsidiaries. A number of other statutes and regulations may affect the Company and the Bank but are not discussed in the following paragraphs. 

General 

The Bank is a national banking association, subject to federal regulation and oversight by the OCC. The activities of the Bank are limited to those specifically authorized under the National Bank Act and related interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has authority to bring an enforcement action against the Bank for unsafe or unsound banking practices, which could include limiting the Bank&#8217;s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities, or imposing corrective capital or managerial requirements on the bank. We are also subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC, which insures the deposits of the Bank to the extent permitted by law and the requirements established by the Federal Reserve. The Bank is also subject to the supervision of the CFPB, which regulates the offering and provision of consumer financial products or services under federal consumer financial laws. The OCC, FDIC and the CFPB may take regulatory enforcement actions if we do not operate in accordance with applicable regulations, policies and directives. Proceedings may be instituted against us, or any "institution-affiliated party", such as a director, officer, employee, agent or controlling person, who engages in unsafe and unsound practices, including violations of applicable laws and regulations. The FDIC has additional authority to terminate insurance of accounts, if after notice and hearing, we are found to have engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, including violations of applicable laws and regulations. The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which to operate and is primarily intended for the protection of depositors and the FDIC's DIF rather than our shareholders. 

As a bank holding company, we are required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve. We are required to file certain reports, and we are subject to examination by, and the enforcement authority of, the Federal Reserve. Under the federal securities laws, we are also subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. 

Any change to laws and regulations, whether by the Regulatory Agencies or Congress, could have a materially adverse impact on our operations. 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

Enacted in July 2010, the DFA significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and will continue to affect, into the immediate future, the lending and investment activities and general operations of depository institutions and their holding companies. The DFA is complex and comprehensive legislation that impacts practically all aspects of a banking organization, and represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry. 

The New York Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 

In 2019, the New York State Legislature passed the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 impacting about one million rent-regulated apartment units. Among other things, the new legislation: (i) curtails rent increases from material capital improvements and Individual Apartment Improvements; (ii) all but eliminates the ability for apartments to exit rent regulation; (iii) does away with vacancy decontrol and high income deregulation; and (iv) repealed the 20 percent vacancy bonus. While it will take several years for its full impact to be known, the legislation generally limits a landlord&#8217;s ability to increase rents on rent-regulated apartments and makes it more difficult to convert rent regulated apartments to market rent apartments. 

Capital Requirements 

In 2013, the FRB and the FDIC approved revisions to their capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules to implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly called Basel III, and to address relevant provisions of the DFA. Basel III generally refers to two consultative documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2009. The Basel III rules generally refer to the rules adopted by U.S. banking regulators in December 2010 to align U.S. bank capital requirements with Basel III and with the related loss absorbency rules they issued in January 2011, which include significant changes to bank capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements. 

The Basel III rules include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective January 1, 2015, and revised the definition of what constitutes &#8220;capital&#8221; for the purposes of calculating those ratios. Under Basel III, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain minimum capital in accordance with the following ratios: (i) a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 percent; (ii) a tier 1 capital ratio of 6 percent (increased from 4 percent); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8 percent (unchanged from the prior rules); and (iv) a tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 percent. 

In addition, the Basel III rules assign higher risk weights to certain assets, such as the 150 percent risk weighting assigned to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on non-accrual status, and to certain CRE facilities that finance the acquisition, development, or construction of real property. Basel III also eliminate the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities, from tier 1 capital. In addition, tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of tier 1 capital included in total capital. Mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets, and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated percentages of common stock are required, subject to limitation, to be deducted from capital. Finally, tier 1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. 

Basel III also established a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; (consisting entirely of common equity tier 1 capital) that is 2.5 percent above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements. This resulted in an increase in the minimum common equity tier 1, tier 1, and total capital ratios to 7.0 percent, 8.5 percent, and 10.5 percent, respectively. The capital conservation buffer is now at its fully phased-in level of 2.5 percent. An institution can be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital levels fall below these amounts. Basel III also establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such capital distributions. 

On September 17, 2019, the FRB, the FDIC, and the OCC issued a final rule designed to reduce regulatory burden by simplifying several requirements in the agencies&#8217; regulatory capital rule. Most aspects of the rule apply only to banking organizations that are not subject to the &#8220;advanced approaches&#8221; in the capital rule, which are generally firms with less than $250.0 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $10.0 billion in total foreign exposure. The rule simplifies and clarifies a number of the more complex aspects of the existing capital rule. Specifically, the rule simplifies the capital treatment for certain mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions, and minority interests. 

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;) requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For such purposes, the law establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. The five capital tiers are described in more detail below. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, an institution that fails to remain &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens. Such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions, restrictions on asset growth, or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications. The FDICIA also provides for enhanced supervision authority over undercapitalized institutions, including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution. 

As a result of the Basel III rules, new definitions of the relevant measures for the five capital categories took effect on January 1, 2015. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10 percent or greater, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent or greater, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5 percent or greater, and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 5 percent or greater, and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 

An institution is deemed to be &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent or greater, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6 percent or greater, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 percent or greater, and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 percent or greater. 

An institution is deemed to be &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8 percent, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6 percent, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5 percent, or a tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4 percent. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6 percent, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4 percent, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3 percent, or a tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3 percent. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2 percent. 

&#8220;Undercapitalized&#8221; institutions are subject to growth, capital distribution (including dividend), and other limitations, and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. An institution&#8217;s compliance with such a plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5 percent of the bank&#8217;s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is &#8220;significantly undercapitalized.&#8221; Significantly undercapitalized institutions are subject to one or more additional restrictions including, but not limited to, an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized; requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, or dismiss directors or officers; and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers, and capital distributions by the parent holding company. 

Beginning 60 days after becoming &#8220;critically undercapitalized,&#8221; critically undercapitalized institutions also may not make any payment of principal or interest on certain subordinated debt, extend credit for a highly leveraged transaction, or enter into any material transaction outside the ordinary course of business. In addition, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver is required for a critically undercapitalized institution within 270 days after it obtains such status. 

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information, see the Capital section of the MD&#38;A and Note 17 - Capital. As of December 31, 2023, each of the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios exceeded those required for an institution to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under these regulations. 

Enhanced Stress Testing and Prudential Standards 

As a result of the Signature transaction, our total assets exceeded $100 billion and therefore we became classified as a Category IV banking organization under the rules issued by the federal banking agencies that tailor the application of enhanced prudential standards to large bank holding companies and the capital and liquidity rules to large bank holding companies and depository institutions under the Dodd-Frank Act and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. As a Category IV banking organization, we are subject to enhanced liquidity risk management requirements which include 

reporting, liquidity stress testing, a liquidity buffer and resolution planning, subject to the applicable transition periods. If we were to meet or exceed certain other thresholds for asset size, we would become subject to additional requirements. 

As a Category IV banking organization, we are subject to risk committee and risk management requirements, as well as capital planning, liquidity risk management, liquidity buffer and liquidity stress testing requirements. 

Stress Testing for Category IV U.S. Banking Organizations 

In 2019, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) finalized a framework that sorts large banking organizations into one of four categories of prudential standards based on their risk profiles (the &#8220;tailoring rule&#8221;). The most stringent prudential standards apply under Category I (defined as U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks and their depository institution subsidiaries), and the least stringent prudential standards apply under Category IV (defined as U.S. banking organizations with $100.0 billion or more but less than $250.0 billion in total assets and have less than $75.0 billion in cross-jurisdictional activity, weighted short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, or off-balance sheet exposure). 

In January 2021, the Board finalized a rule to update capital planning requirements for large banks to be consistent with the tailoring rule. The Board's capital planning requirements for large banks help ensure they plan for and determine their capital needs under a range of different scenarios. The rule removes the company-run stress test requirement for banking organizations subject to Category IV standards. Therefore, banking organizations subject to Category IV standards are not required to calculate forward-looking projections of capital under scenarios provided by the Board. 

The rule also aligns the frequency of the calculation of the stress capital buffer requirement with the frequency of the supervisory stress test (with both occurring every other year for banking organizations subject to Category IV standards). The rule allows a banking organization subject to Category IV standards to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test in a year in which the banking organization would not otherwise be subject to the supervisory stress test, and to receive an updated stress capital buffer requirement in that year. 

Standards for Safety and Soundness 

Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe, for the depository institutions under its jurisdiction, standards that relate to, among other things, internal controls; information and audit systems; loan documentation; credit underwriting; the monitoring of interest rate risk; asset growth; compensation; fees and benefits; and such other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. The federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness (the &#8220;Guidelines&#8221;) to implement these safety and soundness standards. The Guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the Guidelines, the agency may require the institution to provide it with an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard, as required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, (the &#8220;FDI Act&#8221;). 

FDIC, OCC, and FRB Regulations 

The discussion that follows pertains to FDIC, OCC, and FRB regulations other than those already discussed on the preceding pages. 

Additional Regulations 

The following pertains to regulations other than those already discussed on the preceding pages. 

Real Estate Lending Standards 

The FDIC and the other federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that prescribe standards for extensions of credit that (i) are secured by real estate, or (ii) are made for the purpose of financing construction or improvements on real estate. The FDIC regulations require each institution to establish and maintain written internal real estate lending standards that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices, and appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature and scope of its real estate lending activities. The standards also must be consistent with accompanying FDIC Guidelines, which include loan-to-value limitations for the different types of real estate loans. Institutions are also permitted to make a limited amount of loans that do not conform to the proposed loan-to-value limitations as long as such exceptions are reviewed and justified 

appropriately. The FDIC Guidelines also list a number of lending situations in which exceptions to the loan-to-value standards are justified. 

The FDIC, the OCC, and the FRB (collectively, the &#8220;Federal Banking Agencies&#8221;) also have issued joint guidance entitled &#8220;Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices&#8221; (the &#8220;CRE Guidance&#8221;). The CRE Guidance, which addresses land development, construction, and certain multi-family loans, as well as CRE loans, does not establish specific lending limits but, rather, reinforces and enhances the Federal Banking Agencies&#8217; existing regulations and guidelines for such lending and portfolio management. Specifically, the CRE Guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in CRE lending if (1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100 percent or more of total risk-based capital; or (2) total reported loans secured by multi-family properties, non-farm non-residential properties (excluding those that are owner-occupied), and loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 300 percent or more of total risk-based capital. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address key elements, including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of CRE lending. 

On December 13, 2019, the Federal Banking Agencies issued a final rule, which became effective on April 1, 2020, to modify the agencies&#8217; capital rules for high volatility CRE (&#8220;HVCRE&#8221;) exposures, as required by the EGRRCPA. The final rule revises the definition of HVCRE exposure to make it consistent with the statutory definition of the term included in Section 214 of the EGRRCPA, which excludes any loan made before January 1, 2015. The revised HVCRE exposure definition differs from the previous definition primarily in two ways. First, the previous definition applied to loans that financed ADC activities, whereas the new definition only applies to loans that &#8220;primarily&#8221; finance ADC activities and that are secured by land or improved real estate. This change excludes multipurpose credit facilities that primarily finance the purchase of equipment or other non-ADC activities. Second, the new definition permits the full appraised value of borrower-contributed land (less the total amount of any liens on the real property securing the HVCRE exposure) to count toward the 15 percent capital contribution of the real property&#8217;s appraised &#8220;as completed&#8221; value, which is one of the criteria for an exemption from the heightened risk weight. The final rule includes a grandfathering provision, which provides banking organizations with the option to maintain their current capital treatment for ADC loans originated on or after January 1, 2015, and before April 1, 2020. Banking organizations also will have the option to reevaluate any or all of their ADC loans originated on or after January 1, 2015, using the revised HVCRE exposure definition. 

Dividend Limitations 

The Parent Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases, the Parent Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to the Company&#8217;s shareholders. As a Delaware corporation, the Parent Company is able to pay dividends either from surplus or, in case there is no surplus, from net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. 

Various legal restrictions limit the extent to which the Company&#8217;s subsidiary bank can supply funds to the Parent Company and its non-bank subsidiaries. The Bank would require the approval of the OCC if the dividends it declares in any calendar year were to exceed the total of its respective net profits for that year combined with its respective retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfer to paid-in capital. The term &#8220;net profits&#8221; is defined as net income for a given period less any dividends paid during that period. As a result of our acquisition of Flagstar, we are also required to seek regulatory approval from the OCC for the payment of any dividend to the Parent Company through at least the period ending November 1, 2024. In 2023, dividends of $580 million were paid by the Bank to the Parent Company. 

Investment Activities 

National bank investment activities are governed by the National Bank Act and OCC regulations which, consistent with safe and sound banking practices, prescribe standards under which national banks may purchase, sell, deal in, underwrite, and hold securities. The types of investment activities that are permissible for national banks, and the calculation of limits for investments in such covered securities, are set forth in regulations promulgated by the OCC (12 CFR Part 1), as further described in the OCC&#8217;s Investment Securities Policy Statement (OCC Bulletin 1998-20). A national bank must adhere to safe and sound banking practices and the specific requirements of the OCC's regulations in conducting such investment activities. A bank must consider, as appropriate, the interest rate, credit, liquidity, price, foreign exchange, transaction, compliance, strategic, and reputation risks presented by a proposed activity, and the particular activities undertaken by the bank must be appropriate for that bank. If the OCC determines for safety and soundness reasons that a bank should calculate its investment limits more frequently than required by the OCC's Investment Securities regulations, the OCC may provide written notice to the bank 

directing the bank to calculate its investment limitations at a more frequent interval, and the bank must thereafter calculate its investment limits at that interval until further notice from the OCC. 

The GLBA and FDIC regulations also impose certain quantitative and qualitative restrictions on such activities and on a bank&#8217;s dealings with a subsidiary that engages in specified activities. 

Enforcement 

The OCC has authority to bring an enforcement action against the Bank for unsafe or unsound banking practices, which could include limiting the Bank&#8217;s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities, or imposing corrective capital or managerial requirements on the bank. In addition, the Parent Company is subject to the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve. The enforcement authority of these regulatory agencies includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders, and to remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. 

Insurance of Deposit Accounts 

The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF. The maximum deposit insurance provided by the FDIC per account owner is $250,000 for all types of accounts. 

Under the FDIC&#8217;s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based upon supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital level, and certain other factors, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments based on the assigned risk levels. An institution&#8217;s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain other factors. Assessment rates range from 1.5 to 40 basis points of the institution&#8217;s assessment base, which is calculated as average total assets minus average tangible equity. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment. Deposit insurance assessments are based on total average assets, excluding PPP loans, less average tangible common equity. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Management cannot predict what insurance assessments rates will be in the future. 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by the FDIC. Management does not know of any practice, condition, or violation that would lead to termination of the deposit insurance for the Bank. 

On November 16, 2023, the FDIC published in the Federal Register its final rule that imposes special assessments to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising from the protection of uninsured depositors in connection with the systemic risk determination announced on March 12, 2023, following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The assessment base for the special assessments is equal to an insured depository institution&#8217;s estimated uninsured deposits, reported as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits from the insured depository institution, or for insured depository institutions that are part of a holding company with one or more subsidiary insured depository institutions, at the banking organization level. The final rule calls for the FDIC to collect special assessments at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points, over eight quarterly assessment periods. Because the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination will be periodically adjusted, the FDIC retains the ability to cease collection early, extend the special assessment collection period one or more quarters beyond the initial eight-quarter collection period to collect the difference between actual or estimated losses and the amounts collected, and impose a final shortfall special assessment on a one-time basis after the receiverships for Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank terminate. The final rule set an effective date of April 1, 2024, with special assessments collected beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024 (i.e., January 1 through March 31, 2024, with an invoice payment date of June 28, 2024). 

In February 2024, we received notification from the FDIC that the estimated loss attributable to the protection of uninsured depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank is $20.4 billion, an increase of approximately $4.1 billion from the estimate of $16.3 billion described in the final rule. The FDIC plans to provide institutions subject to the special assessment an updated estimate of each institution&#8217;s quarterly and total special assessment expense with its first quarter 2024 special assessment invoice, to be released in June 2024. We expect an increase in special assessment expense, which is not expected to be material, on or around June 2024 based on the FDIC&#8217;s modified loss estimate. 

Holding Company Regulations 

Federal Regulation. The Company is currently subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the BHCA, as administered by the FRB. 

Acquisition, Activities and Change in Control . The Company may only conduct, or acquire control of companies engaged in activities permissible for a bank holding company pursuant to the BHCA. Further, we generally are required to obtain Federal Reserve approval before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank, bank holding company, savings associations or savings and loan holding company if we would own or control more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of that entity. Additionally, we are prohibited from acquiring control of a depository institution that is not federally insured or retaining control for more than one year after the date that institution becomes uninsured. 

We may not be acquired unless the transaction is approved by the Federal Reserve. In addition, the GLBA generally restricts a company from acquiring us if that company is engaged directly or indirectly in activities that are not permissible for a bank holding company or financial holding company. 

Capital Requirements. The Company and the Bank are currently subject to the regulatory capital framework and guidelines reached by Basel III as adopted by the OCC and Federal Reserve. The OCC and Federal Reserve have risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to measure capital adequacy with regard to a banking organization&#8217;s balance sheet, including off-balance sheet exposures such as unused portions of loan commitments, letters of credit and recourse arrangements. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information, see the Capital section of the MD&#38;A and Note 17 -Capital. 

Holding Company Limitations on Capital Distributions. Our ability to make any capital distributions to our stockholders, including dividends and share repurchases, is subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve and contingent upon their non-objection to such planned distributions which typically considers our capital adequacy, comprehensiveness and effectiveness of capital planning and the prudence of the proposed capital action. 

Acquisition of the Holding Company 

Federal Restrictions 

Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act (&#8220;CIBCA&#8221;), a notice must be submitted to the FRB if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire 10 percent or more of the Company&#8217;s shares of outstanding common stock, unless the FRB has found that the acquisition will not result in a change in control of the Company. Under the CIBCA, the FRB generally has 60 days within which to act on such notices, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer; the convenience and needs of the communities served by the Company, the Bank; and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Under the BHCA, any company would be required to obtain approval from the FRB before it may obtain &#8220;control&#8221; of the Company within the meaning of the BHCA. Control generally is defined to mean the ownership or power to vote 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the Company, the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of the Company&#8217;s directors, or the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the Company. Under the BHCA, an existing bank holding company would be required to obtain the FRB&#8217;s approval before acquiring more than 5 percent of the Company&#8217;s voting stock. See &#8220;Holding Company Regulation&#8221; earlier in this report. 

Banking Regulation 

Limitation on Capital Distributions . The OCC and FRB regulate all capital distributions made by the Bank, directly or indirectly, to the holding company, including dividend payments. An application to the OCC by the Bank may be required based on a number of factors including whether the Bank would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution or if the total amount of all capital distributions (including each proposed capital distribution) for the applicable calendar year exceeds net income for that year to date plus the retained net income for the preceding two years. As a result of our acquisition of Flagstar, we are required to seek regulatory approval from the OCC for the payment of any dividend to the Parent Company through at least the period ending November 1, 2024, which could restrict our ability to pay the common stock dividend. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

Under current federal law, transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB&#8217;s Regulation W promulgated thereunder. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the institution or its subsidiaries may engage in &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10 percent of the institution&#8217;s capital stock and surplus, and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20 percent of such capital stock and surplus. Section 23A also establishes specific collateral requirements for loans or extensions of credit to, or guarantees or acceptances on letters of credit issued on behalf of, an affiliate. Section 23B requires that covered transactions and a broad list of other specified transactions be on terms substantially the same as, or at least as favorable to, the institution or its subsidiaries as similar transactions with non-affiliates. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by the Company to its executive officers and directors. However, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act contains a specific exemption for loans made by an institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with other federal banking laws. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, and FRB Regulation O adopted thereunder, govern loans by a bank to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

Federal Regulation 

Under the CRA, as implemented by OCC regulations, an institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA generally does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, nor does it limit an institution&#8217;s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. However, institutions are rated on their performance in meeting the needs of their communities. Performance is tested in three areas: (1) lending, to evaluate the institution&#8217;s record of making loans in its assessment areas; (2) investment, to evaluate the institution&#8217;s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low- or moderate-income individuals and businesses; and (3) service, to evaluate the institution&#8217;s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices. The CRA requires each federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of a financial institution, to assess and assign one of four ratings to the institution&#8217;s record of meeting the credit needs of the community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the institution, including applications for charters, branches and other deposit facilities, relocations, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions of assets or assumptions of liabilities, and bank holding company and savings and loan holding company acquisitions. The CRA also requires that all institutions make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. 

On October 24, 2023, the OCC, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve issued a final rule amending the agencies&#8217; CRA regulations. The final rule (i) encourages banks to expand access to credit, investment and banking services in low- and moderate-income communities, (ii) adapts to changes in the banking industry, including mobile and online banking, (iii) provides greater clarity and consistency in the application of CRA regulations and (iv) tailors CRA evaluations and data collection to bank size and type. Under the final rule, the agencies will evaluate bank performance across the varied activities they conduct and communities in which they operate so that the CRA continues to be an effective tool to address inequities in access to credit and financial services. The final rule also updates existing CRA regulations to evaluate lending outside traditional assessment areas generated by the growth of non-branch delivery systems, such as online and mobile banking, branchless banking, and hybrid models. In addition, the final rule implements a new metrics-based approach to evaluating bank retail lending and community development financing, using benchmarks based on peer and demographic data. Most of the final rule&#8217;s requirements will become effective beginning on January 1, 2026 and the remaining requirements, including the final rule&#8217;s data reporting requirements, will become effective on January 1, 2027. 

Community Pledge Agreement with the National Community Reinvestment Coalition 

On January 24, 2022, the Company and the National Community Reinvestment Coalition ("NCRC") announced the Company's commitment to provide $28.0 billion in loans, investments, and other financial support to communities and people of color, low- and moderate-income ("LMI") families and communities, and small businesses. The Company's Community Pledge Agreement was developed with NCRC and its members in conjunction with the Company's merger with Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. The agreement includes $22.0 billion in community lending and affordable housing commitments and $6.0 billion of residential mortgage originations to underserved and LMI borrowers, and in LMI and majority-minority neighborhoods over a five-year period. The Company will also provide $542 million in loans to small businesses with less than $1 million in revenues and in LMI and majority-minority communities; $16.5 million in philanthropic support to nonprofit organizations that meet the needs of LMI and majority-minority communities and individuals; greater access to banking products and services; and the continuation of the Company's responsible multi-family lending practices. 

Bank Secrecy and Anti-Money Laundering 

The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act (&#8220;BSA&#8221;) and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, commonly referred to as the &#8220;USA PATRIOT Act&#8221; or the &#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;. The BSA requires all financial institutions to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA includes various record keeping and reporting requirements such as cash transaction and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligence requirements. The Bank is also required to comply with the U.S. Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals, individuals, entities and others. The USA PATRIOT Act contains prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence standards intended to prevent the use of the United States financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Patriot Act requires banks and other depository institutions, brokers, dealers and certain other businesses involved in the transfer of money to establish anti-money laundering programs, including employee training and independent audit requirements meeting minimum standards specified by the Patriot Act, to follow standards for customer identification and maintenance of customer identification records, and to compare customer lists against lists of suspected terrorists, terrorist organizations and money launderers. The Patriot Act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition. 

We have developed and operate an enterprise-wide anti-money laundering program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations. Our anti-money laundering program is also designed to prevent our products from being used to facilitate business in certain countries or territories, or with certain individuals or entities, including those on designated lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Controls and other U.S. and non-U.S. sanctions authorities. Our anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance programs include policies, procedures, reporting protocols, and internal controls designed to identify, monitor, manage, and mitigate the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. These controls include procedures and processes to detect and report potentially suspicious transactions, perform consumer due diligence, respond to requests from law enforcement, and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments. Our programs are designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and to assist in managing risk associated with money laundering and terrorist financing. 

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 

The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, foreign nationals, and others. These are typically known as the &#8220;OFAC&#8221; rules, based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control. The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with, or investment in, a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from, and exports to, a sanctioned country and prohibitions on &#8220;U.S. persons&#8221; engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off, or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. 

Data Privacy 

Federal and state law contains extensive consumer privacy protection provisions. The GLBA requires financial institutions to periodically disclose their privacy practices and policies relating to sharing such information and enable retail customers to opt out of the Company&#8217;s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. The GLBA also requires financial institutions to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, and imposes certain limitations on the ability to share consumers&#8217; nonpublic personal information with non-affiliated third-parties. Privacy requirements, including notice and opt out requirements, under the GLBA and the FCRA are enforced by the FTC and by the CFPB through UDAAP laws and regulations, and are a standard component of CFPB examinations. State entities also may initiate actions for alleged violations of privacy or security requirements under state law. 

Furthermore, an increasing number of state, federal, and international jurisdictions have enacted, or are considering enacting, privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;), which became effective on January 1, 2020, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;), which regulates the collection, control, sharing, disclosure and use and other processing of personal information of data subjects in the EU and the European Economic Area. The CCPA gives residents of California expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used, and also provides for civil penalties for violations and private rights of action for data breaches. Meanwhile, the GDPR provides data subjects with greater control over the collection and use of their personal information (such as the &#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221;) and has specific requirements relating to cross-border transfers of personal information to certain jurisdictions, including to the United States, with fines for noncompliance of up to the greater of 20 million euros or up to 4 percent of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company. In addition, California approved a new privacy law in 2020, the California Privacy Rights Act (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;), which significantly modifies the CCPA, including by expanding consumers&#8217; rights with respect to certain personal information and creating a new state agency to oversee implementation and enforcement efforts. 

Cybersecurity 

The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (the &#8220;CISA&#8221;) is intended to improve cybersecurity in the U.S. through sharing of information about security threats between the U.S. government and private sector organizations, including financial institutions such as the Company. The CISA also authorizes companies to monitor their own systems, notwithstanding any other provision of law, and allows companies to carry out defensive measures on their own systems from potential cyber-attacks. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted to address, among other things, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having those Officers certify that they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting; that they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System 

The Bank is a member of the FHLB-NY and FHLB-Indianapolis. As a member of the FHLB-NY, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of FHLB-NY capital stock. At December 31, 2023 the Bank held $861 million of FHLB-NY stock and $329 million of FHLB-Indianapolis shares. 

Federal Securities Law 

The Company&#8217;s common stock and certain other securities listed on the cover page of this report are registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). The Company is subject to the information and proxy solicitation requirements, insider trading restrictions, and other requirements under the Exchange Act. 

Consumer Protection Regulations 

The activities of the Company&#8217;s banking subsidiary, including its lending and deposit gathering activities, is subject to a variety of consumer laws and regulations designed to protect consumers. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements, and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients and monitor account activity when taking deposits from, making loans to, or engaging in other types of transactions with, such clients. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties, operating restrictions, and reputational damage to the financial institution. 

Applicable consumer protection laws, and their implementing regulations, include, but may not be limited to, the DFA, Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), Truth in Savings Act (Regulation DD), Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B), Electronic Funds Transfer Act (Regulation E), Fair Housing Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (Regulation C), Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (Regulation F), Fair Credit Reporting Act (Regulation V), as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, Expedited Funds Availability (Regulation CC), Reserve Requirements (Regulation D), Insider Transactions (Regulation O), Privacy of Consumer Information (Regulation P), Margin Stock Loans (Regulation U), Right To Financial Privacy Act, Flood Disaster Protection Act, Homeowners Protection Act, Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Regulation X), Telephone Consumer Protection Act, CAN-SPAM Act, Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act, the Military Lending Act, and the Homeownership Counseling Act. Additionally, we are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, and Section 1031 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (&#8220;UDAAP&#8221;) in connection with any consumer financial product or service. 

In addition, the Bank and its subsidiaries are subject to certain state laws and regulations designed to protect consumers. Many states have consumer protection laws analogous to, or in addition to, the federal laws listed above, such as usury laws, state debt collection practices laws, and requirements regarding loan disclosures and terms, credit discrimination, credit reporting, money transmission, recordkeeping, and unfair or deceptive business practices. 

Certain states have adopted laws regulating and requiring licensing, registration, notice filing, or other approval for parties that engage in certain activity regarding consumer finance transactions. Furthermore, certain states and localities have adopted laws requiring licensing, registration, notice filing, or other approval for consumer debt collection or servicing, and/or purchasing or selling consumer loans. The licensing statutes vary from state to state and prescribe different requirements, including but not limited to: restrictions on loan origination and servicing practices (including limits on the type, amount, and manner of our fees), interest rate limits, disclosure requirements, periodic examination requirements, surety bond and minimum specified net worth requirements, periodic financial reporting requirements, notification requirements for changes in principal officers, stock ownership or corporate control, restrictions on advertising, and requirements that loan forms be submitted for review. We may also be subject to supervision and examination by applicable state regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we may offer consumer financial products or services. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 

The Bank is subject to oversight by the CFPB within the Federal Reserve System. The CFPB was established under the DFA to implement and enforce rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit acts and practices that are deemed to be unfair, deceptive, or abusive. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that (1) materially interfere with a consumer&#8217;s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service, or (2) take unreasonable advantage of a consumer&#8217;s (a) lack of understanding on the part of the consumer of the material risks, costs, or conditions of the product or service; (b) the inability of the consumer to protect his/her own interest in selecting or using a financial product or service; or (c) the reasonable reliance by the consumer on a financial institution to act in the interests of the consumer. 

The CFPB has exclusive examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations by institutions under its supervision and is authorized, individually or jointly 

with the federal banking agencies, to conduct investigations to determine whether any person is, or has, engaged in conduct that violates such laws or regulations. The CFPB has the authority to investigate possible violations of federal consumer financial law, hold hearings, and commence civil litigation. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB also may institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or an injunction. 

The CFPB is also authorized to collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. The CFPB is authorized to pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for violations of federal consumer financial laws. In these proceedings, the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief) and monetary penalties which, for 2023, range from $6,813 per day for minor violations of federal consumer financial laws (including the CFPB&#8217;s own rules) to $34,065 per day for reckless violations and $1,362,567 per day for knowing violations. The CFPB monetary penalty amounts are adjusted annually for inflation. Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations under Title X, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the CFPB (but not for civil penalties). 

In May 2022, the CFPB issued an Interpretive Rule to clarify the authority of states to enforce federal consumer financial protections laws under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (&#8220;CFPA&#8221;). Specifically, the CFPB confirmed that (1) states can enforce the CFPA, including the provision making it unlawful for covered persons or service providers to violate any provision of federal consumer financial protection law; (2) the enforcement authority of states under section 1042 of the CFPA is generally not subject to certain limits applicable to the CFPB&#8217;s enforcement authority, such that States may be able to bring actions against a broader cross-section of companies than the CFPB; and (3) state attorneys general and regulators may bring (or continue to pursue) actions under their CFPA authority even if the CFPB is pursuing a concurrent action against the same entity. See CFPB Interpretive Rule regarding Section 1042 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (87 FR 31940, May 26, 2022). 

Supervision and Regulation of Mortgage Banking Operations 

Our mortgage banking business is subject to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (&#8220;HUD&#8221;), the Federal Housing Administration, the Veterans&#8217; Administration (&#8220;VA&#8221;) and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with respect to originating, processing, selling and servicing mortgage loans. Those rules and regulations, among other things, prohibit discrimination and establish underwriting guidelines, which include provisions for inspections and appraisals, require credit reports on prospective borrowers, and fix maximum loan amounts. Lenders are required annually to submit audited financial statements to Fannie Mae, FHA and VA. Each of these regulatory entities has its own financial requirements. We are also subject to examination by Fannie Mae, FHA and VA to assure compliance with the applicable regulations, policies and procedures. Mortgage origination activities are subject to, among others, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Report Act, the National Flood Insurance Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and related regulations that prohibit discrimination and require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit terms and settlement costs. Our mortgage banking operations are also affected by various state and local laws and regulations and the requirements of various private mortgage investors. 

Enterprise Risk Management 

The Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s Boards of Directors are actively engaged in the process of overseeing the efforts made by the Enterprise Risk Management department to identify, measure, monitor, mitigate, and report risk. The Company has established an ERM program that reinforces a strong risk culture to support sound risk management practices. The Board is responsible for the approval and oversight of the ERM program and framework. 

ERM is responsible for setting and aligning the Company&#8217;s Risk Appetite Policy with the goals and objectives set forth in the budget, and the strategic and capital plans. Internal controls and ongoing monitoring processes capture and address heightened risks that threaten the Company&#8217;s ability to achieve our goals and objectives, including the recognition of safety and soundness concerns and consumer protection. Additionally, ERM monitors key risk indicators against the established risk warning levels and limits, as well as elevated risks identified by the Chief Risk Officer. 

Recent Events 

Declaration of Dividend on Common Shares 

On January 30, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the Company&#8217;s common stock $0.05 per share, which represented a reduction from the prior quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share. The dividend was paid on February 28, 2024 to common stockholders of record as of February 14, 2024. On March 7, 2024, the Company announced that future quarterly cash dividends on shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock would be further reduced to $0.01 per share. 

Equity Capital Raise 

On March 7, 2024, we entered into separate investment agreements with (a) affiliates of funds managed by Liberty 77 Capital, L.P.

(&#8220; Reverence &#8221;), and (d) certain other investors (the &#8220; Other Investors &#8221; and, collectively with Liberty, Reverence and Hudson Bay, the &#8220; Investors &#8221;, and the investments agreements entered into with each of the Investors on March 7, 2024, collectively, the &#8220; Original Investment Agreements &#8221;). On March 11, 2024, NYCB entered into separate amendments to the Original Investment Agreements with Liberty (such agreement, as amended, the &#8220; Liberty Investment Agreement &#8221;), Hudson Bay (such agreements, as amended, the &#8220; Hudson Bay Investment Agreements &#8221;) and Reverence (such agreement, as amended, the &#8220; Reverence Agreement &#8221; and, collectively with the Liberty Agreement, the Hudson Bay Agreements and the Original Investment Agreements of the Other Investors, the &#8220; Investment Agreements &#8221;). 

Pursuant to the Investment Agreements, on March 11, 2024, the Investors invested an aggregate of approximately $1.05 billion in the Company in exchange for the sale and issuance by the Company of (a) 76,630,965 shares of our common stock, at a purchase price per share of $2.00, (b) 192,062 shares of a new series of our preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, designated as Series B Noncumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220; Series B Preferred Stock &#8221;), at a price per share of $2,000, each share of which is convertible into 1,000 shares of common stock (or, in certain limited circumstances, one share of Series C Preferred Stock (as defined below)), (c) 256,307 shares of a new series of our preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, designated as Series C Noncumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220; Series C Preferred Stock &#8221;, together with the Series B Preferred Stock, the &#8220; Preferred Stock &#8221;), at a price per share of $2,000, each share of which is convertible into 1,000 shares of common stock, and (d) warrants (the &#8220; Issued Warrants &#8221;), which may not be exercised until 180 days after issuance thereof, affording the holder thereof the right, until the seven-year anniversary of the issuance of such Issued Warrant, to purchase for $2,500 per share, shares of a new class of non-voting, common-equivalent preferred stock of the Company (the &#8220; Series D NVCE Stock &#8221;), each share of Series D NVCE Stock is convertible into 1,000 shares of common stock (or, in certain limited circumstances, one share of Series C Preferred Stock), and all of which shares of Series D NVCE Stock, upon issuance, will represent the right (on an as converted basis) to receive 315,000,000 million shares of common stock.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

There are various risks and uncertainties that are inherent to our business. Primary among these are (1) interest rate risk, which arises from movements in interest rates; (2) credit risk, which arises from an obligor&#8217;s failure to meet the terms of any contract with a bank or to otherwise perform as agreed; (3) risks related to our financial statements; (4) liquidity and dividend risk, which arises from a bank&#8217;s inability to meet its obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses, and related risks regarding our ability to pay dividends; (5) legal/compliance risk, which arises from violations of, or non-conformance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards; (6) financial and market risk, which arises from changes in the value of portfolios of financial instruments, as well as other matters that may dilute the value of our securities; (7) strategic risk, which is the risk of loss arising from the execution of our strategic initiatives and business strategies, including our acquisition and integration of other companies we acquire; (8) operational risk, which arises from problems with service or product delivery; and (9) reputational risk, which arises from negative public opinion resulting in a significant decline in stockholder value. 

Following is a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and the value of our shares. The failure to properly identify, monitor, and mitigate any of the below referenced risks, could result in increased regulatory risk and could potentially have an adverse impact on the Company. Additional risks that are not currently known to us, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, also may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by those risk factors.

&#8226; Dividends on our Series A, B and C Preferred Stock are discretionary and noncumulative, and may not be paid if such payment will result in our failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. 

&#8226; Our Series A, B, and C Preferred Stocks have preferential rights over common stockholders, potentially impacting our liquidity and financial condition. 

Legal/Compliance Risks 

&#8226; Inability to fulfill minimum capital requirements could limit our ability to conduct or expand our business, pay a dividend, or result in termination of our FDIC deposit insurance, and thus impact our financial condition, our results of operations, and the market value of our stock. 

&#8226; Our results of operations could be materially affected by restrictions on our operations imposed by bank regulators, changes in bank regulation, or by our ability to comply with certain existing laws, rules, and regulations governing our industry. 

&#8226; As a Category IV banking organization, we are subject to stringent regulations, including reporting, capital stress testing, and liquidity risk management and non-compliance could result in regulatory risks and restrictions on our activities. 

&#8226; Noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering statutes/regulations could result in material financial loss. 

&#8226; Failure to comply with OFAC regulations could result in legal and reputational risks.

&#8226; Legislative and regulatory focus on data privacy and risks can subject us to heightened scrutiny and reputational damage. 

Financial and Market Risks 

&#8226; Declines in economic conditions could adversely affect the values of loans we originate and securities in which we invest. 

&#8226; Rising mortgage rates and adverse changes in mortgage market conditions could reduce mortgage revenue. 

&#8226; We are highly dependent on the Agencies to buy mortgage loans that we originate, and changes in these entities or in the manner or volume of loans they purchase or their current roles could adversely affect our business and financial condition. 

&#8226; Changes in the servicing, origination, or underwriting guidelines or criteria required by the Agencies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#8226; Future sales or issuances of our common stock or other securities (including warrants) or the issuance of securities pursuant to the exercise of warrants issued by us may dilute existing holders of our common stock and other securities, decrease the value of our common stock and other securities and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and other securities. 

Strategic Risks 

&#8226; Extensive competition for loans and deposits could adversely affect the expansion of our business and our financial condition. 

&#8226; Limitations on our ability to grow our loan portfolios could adversely affect our ability to generate interest income. 

&#8226; The inability to engage in merger transactions, or to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions in which we might engage, could adversely affect our ability to compete with other financial institutions and weaken our financial performance. 

&#8226; We may be exposed to challenges in combining the operations of acquired or merged businesses, including our recent Flagstar acquisition and Signature acquisition, into our operations, which may prevent us from achieving the expected benefits from our merger and acquisition activities. 

&#8226; The success of the Signature transaction will depend on a number of uncertain factors, including our decisions regarding the fair value of the assets acquired and the bargain purchase gain recorded on the transaction, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. 

Operational Risks 

&#8226; Our stress testing processes rely on analytical and forecasting models that may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate, which could adversely affect the effectiveness of our strategic planning and our ability to pursue certain corporate goals. 

&#8226; The Company, entities that we have acquired, and certain of our service providers have experienced information technology security breaches and may be vulnerable to future security breaches, which have resulted in, and could result in, additional expenses, exposure to civil litigation, increased regulatory scrutiny, losses, and a loss of customers. 

&#8226; We rely on third parties to perform certain key business functions, which may expose us to further operational risk. 

&#8226; Failure to keep pace with technological changes could have a material adverse impact on our ability to compete for loans and deposits, and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations. 

&#8226; The inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely impact our operations. 

&#8226; The transition to a new Chief Executive Officer will be critical to our success and our business may be adversely impacted if we do not successfully manage the transition process in a timely manner. 

&#8226; Our operations are dependent upon the soundness of other financial intermediaries and thus could expose us to systemic risk. 

&#8226; We may be terminated as a servicer or subservicer or incur costs or liabilities if we do not satisfy servicing obligations. 

&#8226; We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans, pay fees or indemnify buyers against losses. 

&#8226; We utilize third-party mortgage originators which subjects us to strategic, reputation, compliance and operational risk. 

&#8226; We are subject to various legal or regulatory investigations and proceedings. 

&#8226; We may be required to pay interest on mortgage escrow accounts under state law despite Federal preemption. 

&#8226; We could be exposed to fraud risks that affect our operations and reputation. 

Reputational Risk 

&#8226; Damage to our reputation could significantly harm the business we engage in, our competitive position and growth prospects. 

&#8226; Increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social, and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks. 

Interest Rate Risks 

Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and negatively impact the value of our loans, securities, and other assets. This could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, and capital. 

The cost of our deposits and short-term wholesale borrowings is largely based on short-term interest rates, the level of which is driven by the FOMC of the FRB. However, the yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by intermediate-term interest rates, which are set by the bond market and generally vary from day to day. The level of our net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates, and the pace at which such movements occur. If the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest-earning assets, the result could be a reduction in net interest income and, with it, a reduction in our earnings. Our net interest income and earnings would be similarly impacted were the interest rates on our interest-earning assets to decline more quickly than the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, such changes in interest rates could affect our ability to originate loans and attract and retain deposits; the fair values of our securities and other financial assets; the fair values of our liabilities; and the average lives of our loan and securities portfolios. Changes in interest rates also could have an effect on loan refinancing activity, which, in turn, would impact the amount of prepayment income we receive on our multi-family and CRE loans. Because prepayment income is recorded as interest income, the extent to which it increases or decreases during any given period could have a significant impact on the level of net interest income and net income we generate during that time. Also, changes in interest rates could have an effect on the slope of the yield curve. If the yield curve were to invert or become flat, our net interest income and net interest margin could contract, adversely affecting our net income and cash flows, and the value of our assets. Moreover, higher inflation could lead to fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures, and could result in lower equity market valuations of financial services companies. 

Credit Risk 

Our allowance for credit losses might not be sufficient to cover our actual losses, which would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. 

In addition to mitigating credit risk through our underwriting processes, we attempt to mitigate such risk through the establishment of an allowance for credit losses. The process of determining whether or not the allowance is sufficient to cover potential credit losses is based on the current expected credit loss model or CECL. This methodology is described in detail under &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in this report. CECL may result in greater volatility in the level of the ACL, depending on various assumptions and factors used in this model. If the judgments and assumptions we make with regard to the allowance are incorrect, our allowance for losses on such loans might not be sufficient, and an additional provision for credit losses might need to be made. Depending on the amount of such loan loss provisions, the adverse impact on our earnings could be material. In addition, 

growth in our loan portfolio may require us to increase the allowance for credit losses on such loans by making additional provisions, which would reduce our net income. 

Furthermore, bank regulators have the authority to require us to make provisions for credit losses or otherwise recognize loan charge-offs following their periodic review of our loan portfolio, our underwriting procedures, and our allowance for losses on such loans. Any increase in the loan loss allowance or in loan charge-offs as required by such regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Our concentration in multi-family loans and CRE loans could expose us to increased lending risks and related loan losses. 

At December 31, 2023, $37.3 billion or 44.0 percent of our total loans and leases, held for investment portfolio consisted of multi-family loans and $10.5 billion or 12.4 percent consisted of CRE loans. These types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the properties and the sale of such properties securing the loans. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four family residential loans. Also, many of our borrowers have more than one of these types of loans outstanding. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four family residential real estate loan. In addition, if loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 

The CRE loans we make are secured by income-producing properties such as office buildings, retail centers, mixed-use buildings, and multi-tenanted light industrial properties. At December 31, 2023 , $3.4 billion, or 32.1 percent of ou r commercial real estate loan portfolio was secured by office buildings. We may incur future losses on commercial real estate loans due to declines in occupancy rates and rental rates in office buildings, which could occur as a result of less need for office space due to more people working from home or other factors. 

Our New York State multi-family loan portfolio could be adversely impacted by changes in legislation or regulation which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

On June 14, 2019, the New York State legislature passed the New York Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019. This legislation represents the most extensive reform of New York State&#8217;s rent laws in several decades and generally limits a landlord&#8217;s ability to increase rents on rent regulated apartments and makes it more difficult to convert rent regulated apartments to market rate apartments. As a result, the value of the collateral located in New York State securing the Company&#8217;s multi-family loans or the future net operating income of such properties could potentially become impaired which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Economic weakness in the New York City metropolitan region, where the majority of the properties collateralizing our multi-family, CRE, and ADC loans, and the majority of the businesses collateralizing our other C&#38;I loans, are located could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Our business depends significantly on general economic conditions in the New York City metropolitan region, where the majority of the buildings and properties securing the multi-family, CRE, and ADC loans we originate for investment and the businesses of the customers to whom we make our other C&#38;I loans are located. Accordingly, the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, and the value of the collateral securing such loans, may be significantly affected by economic conditions in this region, including changes in the local real estate market. A significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, acts of terrorism, extreme weather, or other factors beyond our control, could therefore have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because multi-family and CRE loans represent the majority of the loans in our portfolio, a decline in tenant occupancy or rents, due to such factors, or for other reasons, such as new legislation, could adversely impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans on a timely basis, which could have a negative impact on our net income. Furthermore, economic or market turmoil could occur in the near or long term. This could negatively affect our business, our financial condition, and our results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain the level of cash dividends we currently pay to our stockholders. 

Financial Statements Risk 

Our accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models. 

The processes we use to estimate expected losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models that we use for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, we may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models that we use for determining our expected losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models that we use to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what we could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in our analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Impairment in the carrying value of other intangible assets could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. 

At December 31, 2023, other intangible assets, primarily core deposit intangibles, totaled $625 million. We review our other intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. A significant decline in deposits may necessitate taking additional charges in the future related to the impairment of other intangible assets. The amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 

We may fail to maintain effective internal controls, which could impact the accuracy and timeliness of financial reporting. 

We recognize the critical importance of maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting to ensure accurate and timely financial reporting, prevent fraud, and maintain investor confidence. We have implemented a system of internal controls that is regularly reviewed and updated. However, there is a risk that we may fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which could impair our ability to report financial results accurately and in a timely manner. These risks include human error, misconduct, inadequate processes, fraud, data breaches, and non-compliance with laws and regulations. We also acknowledge the challenges posed by changes in processes, procedures, technologies, employee turnover, and labor shortages. We have identified certain material weaknesses described in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and may discover additional future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, which could divert management attention and increase our expenses, in order to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies in our controls. A "material weakness" is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Control weaknesses or failures could result in financial losses, reputational harm, loss of investor confidence, regulatory actions, and limitations on our business activities. 

Liquidity and Dividend Risks 

Failure to maintain an adequate level of liquidity could result in an inability to fulfill our financial obligations and also could subject us to material reputational and compliance risk. 

Our primary sources of liquidity are the retail and institutional deposits we gather or acquire in connection with acquisitions, and the brokered deposits we accept; borrowed funds, primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings from the FHLB-NY and various Wall Street brokerage firms; cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans; and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities. In addition, and depending on current market conditions, we have the ability to access the capital markets from time to time to generate additional liquidity. Deposit flows, calls of investment securities and wholesale borrowings, and the prepayment of loans and mortgage-related securities are strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of interest rates, whether actual or perceived; local and national economic conditions; and competition for deposits and loans in the markets we serve. Deposit outflows can occur for a number of reasons, including clients seeking higher yields, clients with uninsured deposits may seek greater financial security or clients may simply prefer to do business with our competitors, or for other reasons. The withdrawal of more deposits than we anticipate could have an adverse impact on our profitability as this source of funding, if not replaced by similar deposit funding, would need to be 

replaced with more expensive wholesale funding, the sale of interest-earning assets, other sources of funding, or a combination of them all. The replacement of deposit funding with wholesale funding could cause our overall cost of funds to increase, which would reduce our net interest income and results of operations. A decline in interest-earning assets would also lower our net interest income and results of operations. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 35.9 percent of our total deposits of $81.5 billion were not FDIC-insured. 

In addition, large-scale withdrawals of brokered or institutional deposits could require us to pay significantly higher interest rates on our retail deposits or on other wholesale funding sources, which would have an adverse impact on our net interest income and net income. Furthermore, changes to the FHLB-NY&#8217;s underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings or lending policies may limit or restrict our ability to borrow, and therefore could have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity. A decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, and meet our expenses, or to fulfill such obligations as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands. Downgrades of the credit ratings of the Company and the Bank, such as those announced by certain credit rating agencies in both February and March 2024, could result in an acceleration in deposit outflows and additional collateral needs, which this far have been modest. They could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or to purchase our securities. This could affect our growth, profitability, and financial condition, including our liquidity. 

Reduction or elimination of our quarterly cash dividend could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. 

The holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds available for such payments under applicable law and regulatory guidance, and, although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so. Furthermore, the payment of dividends falls under federal regulations that have grown more stringent in recent years. While we pay our quarterly cash dividend in compliance with current regulations, such regulations could change in the future. As a result of our acquisitions of Flagstar and Signature, we are required to seek regulatory approval from the OCC for the payment of any dividend to the Parent Company through at least the period ending November 1, 2024, which could restrict our ability to pay the common stock dividend. In the Company&#8217;s January 31, 2024 earnings release for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors reduced the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend to $0.05 per common share to accelerate the building of capital to support our balance sheet as a Category IV banking organization. Following the issuance of that earnings release, the market price of our common stock experienced a decline. On March 7, 2024, the Company announced that future quarterly cash dividends on shares of the Company's common stock would be further reduced to $0.01 per share. Any further reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend in the future due to actions to build capital or the inability to receive required regulatory approvals, or for any other reason, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 

The inability to receive dividends from our subsidiary bank could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain or increase the current level of cash dividends we pay to our stockholders. 

The Parent Company (i.e., the company on an unconsolidated basis) is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank, and a substantial portion of the revenues the Parent Company receives consists of dividends from the Bank. These dividends are the primary funding source for the dividends we pay on our common stock and the interest and principal payments on our debt. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that a bank may pay to its parent company. In addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary may be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary&#8217;s creditors. As a result of our acquisitions of Flagstar and Signature, we are required to seek regulatory approval from the OCC for the payment of any dividend to the Bancorp through at least the period ending November 1, 2024. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Parent Company, we might not be able to service our debt, pay our obligations, or pay dividends on our common stock. 

If we were to defer payments on our trust preferred capital debt securities or were in default under the related indentures, we would be prohibited from paying dividends or distributions on our common stock. 

The terms of our outstanding trust preferred capital debt securities prohibit us from (1) declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock, including our common stock; or (2) purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, under the following circumstances: (a) if an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the applicable indenture; (b) if we are in default with respect to a payment under the guarantee of the related trust preferred securities; or (c) if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet 

commenced, or a deferral period is continuing. In addition, without notice to, or consent from, the holders of our common stock, we may issue additional series of trust preferred capital debt securities with similar terms, or enter into other financing agreements, that limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. 

Dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock are discretionary and noncumulative, and may not be paid if such payment will result in our failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. 

Dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock are discretionary and noncumulative. If our Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee of the Board) does not authorize and declare a dividend on (a) the Series A Preferred Stock for any dividend period, holders of the depository shares will not be entitled to receive any dividend for that dividend period, and the unpaid dividend will cease to accrue and be payable, or (b) Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, the holders thereof will not be entitled to receive any dividend for that dividend period. For our Series A Preferred Stock, we have no obligation to pay dividends accrued for a dividend period after the dividend payment date for that period if our Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) has not declared a dividend before the related dividend payment date, whether or not dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock or any other series of our preferred stock or our common stock are declared for any future dividend period. Dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock are payable at a rate of 13 percent per annum, payable quarterly and in arrears. Additionally, under the FRB&#8217;s capital rules, dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock may only be paid out of our net income, retained earnings, or surplus related to other additional tier 1 capital instruments. If the non-payment of dividends on Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock for any dividend period would cause the Company to fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, or any agreement we may enter into with our regulators from time to time, then we would not be able to declare or pay a dividend for such dividend period. 

Our Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock initially have rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to the rights of, our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. 

The holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock initially have the right to receive a payment on account of the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our business before any payment may be made to holders of our common stock. Following the satisfaction of the liquidation preference, the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock participates with our common stock on an as-converted basis in a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Our obligations to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock could limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. The preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between the holders of our common stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and other classes of securities. 

Legal/Compliance Risks 

Inability to fulfill minimum capital requirements could limit our ability to conduct or expand our business, pay a dividend, or result in termination of our FDIC deposit insurance, and thus impact our financial condition, our results of operations, and the market value of our stock. 

We are subject to the comprehensive, consolidated supervision and regulation set forth by the FRB and the OCC. Such regulation includes, among other matters, the level of leverage and risk-based capital ratios we are required to maintain. Depending on general economic conditions, changes in our capital position could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and risk profile, and also could limit our ability to grow through acquisitions or otherwise. Compliance with regulatory capital requirements may limit our ability to engage in operations that require the intensive use of capital and therefore could adversely affect our ability to maintain our current level of business or expand. Furthermore, it is possible that future regulatory changes could result in more stringent capital or liquidity requirements, including increases in the levels of regulatory capital we are required to maintain and changes in the way capital or liquidity is measured for regulatory purposes, either of which could adversely affect our business and our ability to expand. For example, federal banking regulations adopted under Basel III standards require bank holding companies and banks to undertake significant activities to demonstrate compliance with higher capital requirements. Any additional requirements to increase our capital ratios or liquidity could necessitate our liquidating certain assets, perhaps on terms that are unfavorable to us or that are contrary to our business plans. In addition, such requirements could also compel us to issue additional securities, thus diluting the value of our common stock. In addition, failure to meet established capital requirements could result in the FRB and/or OCC placing limitations or 

conditions on our activities and further restricting the commencement of new activities. The failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities, including limiting our ability to pay dividends; issuing a directive to increase our capital; and terminating our FDIC deposit insurance. 

Our results of operations could be materially affected by the imposition of restrictions on our operations by bank regulators, further changes in bank regulation, or by our ability to comply with certain existing laws, rules, and regulations governing our industry. 

We are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the following entities: (1) the OCC; (2) the FDIC; (3) the FRB-NY; and (4) the CFPB, as well as state licensing restrictions and limitations regarding certain consumer finance products. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank holding company and its banking subsidiaries may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the DIF, the banking system in general, and bank customers, rather than for the benefit of a company&#8217;s stockholders. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including with respect to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank or a bank holding company, the imposition of significant fines, the ability to delay or deny merger or other regulatory applications, the payment of dividends, the classification of assets by a bank, and the adequacy of a bank&#8217;s allowance for loan losses, among other matters. Failure to comply (or to ensure that our agents and third-party service providers comply) with laws, regulations, or policies, including our failure to obtain any necessary state or local licenses, could result in enforcement actions or sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Penalties for such violations may also include: revocation of licenses; fines and other monetary penalties; civil and criminal liability; substantially reduced payments by borrowers; modification of the original terms of loans, permanent forgiveness of debt, or inability to, directly or indirectly, collect all or a part of the principal of or interest on loans provided by the Bank. Changes in such regulation and supervision, or changes in regulation or enforcement by such authorities, whether in the form of policy, regulations, legislation, rules, orders, enforcement actions, ratings, or decisions, could have a material impact on the Company, our subsidiary bank and other affiliates, and our operations. In addition, failure of the Company or the Bank to comply with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and capital. See &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; in Part I, Item 1, &#8220;Business&#8221; earlier in this filing for a detailed description of the federal, state, and local regulations to which the Company and the Bank are subject. 

As a Category IV banking organization with over $100 billion in assets, we are subject to stringent regulations, including reporting, capital stress testing, and liquidity risk management. Non-compliance could result in regulatory risks and restrictions on our activities. 

As a result of the Signature transaction, our total assets exceeded $100 billion and therefore we became classified as a Category IV banking organization under the rules issued by the federal banking agencies that tailor the application of enhanced prudential standards to large bank holding companies and the capital and liquidity rules to large bank holding companies and depository institutions under the Dodd-Frank Act and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. As a Category IV banking organization we are subject to enhanced liquidity risk management requirements which include reporting, liquidity stress testing, a liquidity buffer and resolution planning, subject to the applicable transition periods. If we were to meet or exceed certain other thresholds for asset size, we would become subject to additional requirements. Failure to meet these requirements could expose us to compliance risks, higher penalties, increased expectations, and limitations on our activities. As a Category IV banking organization, we are required to implement and maintain an adequate liquidity risk management and monitoring process to ensure compliance with these requirements, and our failure to ensure compliance may have adverse consequences on our operations, reputation and future profitability. We anticipate incurring significant expenses to develop policies, programs, and systems that comply with the enhanced standards applicable to us. 

Noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could result in material financial loss. 

The BSA and the USA Patriot Act contain anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The BSA, as amended by the USA Patriot Act, requires depository institutions to undertake activities including maintaining an anti-money laundering program, verifying the identity of clients, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions above a certain threshold, and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies. FINCEN, a unit of the U.S. Treasury Department that administers the BSA, is authorized to impose significant civil monetary penalties for violations of these requirements. If our BSA policies, procedures and systems are deemed to be deficient, or the BSA policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to reputational risk and potential liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay 

dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Failure to comply with OFAC regulations could result in legal and reputational risks. 

The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, foreign nationals, and other potentially exposed persons. These are typically referred to as the "OFAC" rules, given their administration by the United States Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. 

Our enterprise risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating the risks to which we are subject, based upon the size, scope, and complexity of the Company. 

As a financial institution, we are subject to a number of risks, including interest rate, credit, liquidity, legal/compliance, market, strategic, operational, and reputational. Our ERM framework is designed to minimize the risks to which we are subject, as well as any losses stemming from such risks. Although we seek to identify, measure, monitor, report, and control our exposure to such risks, and employ a broad and diverse set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process, those techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated. For example, economic and market conditions, heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, and increases in the overall complexity of our operations, among other developments, have resulted in the creation of a variety of risks that were previously unknown and unanticipated, highlighting the intrinsic limitations of our risk monitoring and mitigation techniques. As a result, the further development of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, an ineffective ERM framework, as well as other risk factors, could result in a material increase in our FDIC insurance premiums. 

If federal, state, or local tax authorities were to determine that we did not adequately provide for our taxes, our income tax expense could be increased, adversely affecting our earnings. 

The amount of income taxes we are required to pay on our earnings is based on federal, state, and local legislation and regulations. We provide for current and deferred taxes in our financial statements, based on our results of operations, business activity, legal structure, interpretation of tax statutes, assessment of risk of adjustment upon audit, and application of financial accounting standards. We may take tax return filing positions for which the final determination of tax is uncertain, and our net income and earnings per share could be reduced if a federal, state, or local authority were to assess additional taxes that have not been provided for in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will achieve our anticipated effective tax rate. Unanticipated changes in tax laws or related regulatory or judicial guidance, or an audit assessment that denies previously recognized tax benefits, could result in our recording tax expenses that materially reduce our net income. 

We are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions. 

The CRA requires the Federal Reserve and OCC to assess our performance in meeting the credit needs of the communities we serve, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. If the Federal Reserve or OCC determines that we need to improve our performance or are in substantial non-compliance with CRA requirements, various adverse regulatory consequences may ensue. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CFPB, the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. The CFPB is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider, identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are &#8220;unfair, deceptive, or abusive&#8221; in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution&#8217;s performance under the CRA, fair lending laws or regulations, or consumer lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution&#8217;s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, state attorneys general have indicated that they intend to take a more active role in enforcing consumer protection laws, including through use of Dodd-Frank Act provisions that authorize state attorneys general to enforce certain provisions of federal consumer financial laws and obtain civil money 

penalties and other relief available to the CFPB. If we become subject to such investigation, the required response could result in substantial costs and a diversion of the attention and resources of our management. 

Legislative and regulatory focus on data privacy and risks can subject us to heightened scrutiny and reputational damage. 

Data privacy and cybersecurity risks have become a subject of heightened legislative and regulatory focus in recent years. Federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed regulations to enhance cyber risk management standards, which would apply to us and our third-party service providers. These regulations focus on areas such as cyber risk governance, management of dependencies, incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. State-level legislation and regulations have also been proposed or adopted, requiring notification to individuals in the event of a security breach of their personal data. Examples include the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and other state-level privacy, data protection, and data security laws and regulations. We collect, maintain, and use non-public personal information of our customers, clients, employees, and others. The sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of this information are governed by federal and state laws. Compliance with these laws is essential to protect the privacy of personal information and avoid potential liability and reputational damage. Failure to comply with privacy laws and regulations may expose us to fines, litigation, or regulatory enforcement actions. It may also require changes to our systems, business practices, or privacy policies, which could adversely impact our operating results. Privacy initiatives have imposed and will continue to impose additional operational burdens on us. These initiatives may limit our ability to pursue desirable business initiatives and increase the risks associated with any future use of personal data. New privacy and data protection initiatives, such as the CCPA, may require changes to policies, procedures, and technology for information security and data segregation. Non-compliance with these initiatives may make us more vulnerable to operational failures and subject to monetary penalties, litigation, or regulatory enforcement actions. 

Financial and Market Risks 

A decline in economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the loans we originate and the securities in which we invest. 

Declines in real estate values and an increase in the financial stress on borrowers stemming from high unemployment or other adverse economic conditions, could negatively affect our borrowers and, in turn, the repayment of the loans in our portfolio. Deterioration in economic conditions also could subject us and our industry to increased regulatory scrutiny, and could result in an increase in loan delinquencies, an increase in problem assets and foreclosures, and a decline in the value of the collateral for our loans, which could reduce our customers&#8217; borrowing power. Deterioration in local economic conditions could drive the level of loan losses beyond the level we have provided for in our loan loss allowance; this, in turn, could necessitate an increase in our provisions for loan losses, which would reduce our earnings and capital. Furthermore, declines in the value of our investment securities could result in our having to record losses based on the other-than-temporary impairment of securities, which would reduce our earnings and also could reduce our capital. In addition, continued economic weakness could reduce the demand for our products and services, which would adversely impact our liquidity and the revenues we produce. 

Rising mortgage rates and adverse changes in mortgage market conditions could reduce mortgage revenue. 

The residential real estate mortgage lending business is sensitive to changes in interest rates, especially long-term interest rates. Lower interest rates generally increase the volume of mortgage originations, while higher interest rates generally cause that volume to decrease. Therefore, our mortgage performance is typically correlated to fluctuations in interest rates, primarily the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate. Historically, mortgage origination volume and sales for the Bank and for other financial institutions have risen and fallen in response to these and other factors. An increase in interest rates and/or a decrease in our mortgage production volume could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results. The 10-year U.S. Treasury rate was 3.97 percent at December 31, 2023 , and averaged 2.96 percent during 2023, 101 basis points higher than average rates experienced during 2022 . The sustained higher rates experienced throughout 2023 negatively impacted the mortgage market including our loan origination volume and refinancing activity. In addition to being affected by interest rates, the secondary mortgage markets are also subject to investor demand for residential mortgage loans and investor yield requirements for these loans. These conditions may fluctuate or worsen in the future. Adverse market conditions, including increased volatility, changes in interest rates and mortgage spreads and reduced market demand, could result in greater risk in retaining mortgage loans pending their sale to investors. A prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may result in a reduction of our loan mortgage production volume and could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Our mortgage origination business is also subject to the cyclical and seasonal trends of the real estate market. The cyclical nature of our industry could lead to periods of growth in the mortgage and real estate markets followed by periods of declines 

and losses in such markets. Seasonal trends have historically reflected the general patterns of residential and commercial real estate sales, which typically peak in the spring and summer seasons. One of the primary influences on our mortgage business is the aggregate demand for mortgage loans, which is affected by prevailing interest rates, housing supply and demand, residential construction trends, and overall economic conditions. If we are unable to respond to the cyclical nature of our industry by appropriately adjusting our operations or relying on the strength of our other product offerings during cyclical downturns, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, the fair value of our MSRs is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in market implied interest rate volatility. Decreases in interest rates can trigger an increase in actual repayments and market expectation for higher levels of repayments in the future which have a negative impact on MSR fair value. Conversely, higher rates typically drive lower repayments which results in an increase in the MSR fair value. We utilize derivatives to manage the impact of changes in the fair value of the MSRs. We may have basis risk and our risk management strategies, which rely on assumptions or projections, may not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, interest rate volatility, convexity, credit spreads, or prepayment speeds, and, as a result, the change in the fair value of MSRs may negatively impact earnings. 

We are highly dependent on the Agencies to buy mortgage loans that we originate. Changes in these entities and changes in the manner or volume of loans they purchase or their current roles could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We generate mortgage revenues primarily from gains on the sale of single-family residential loans pursuant to programs currently offered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and other investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. Any future changes in these programs, our eligibility to participate in such programs, their concentration limits with respect to loans purchased from us, the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of such entities could, in turn, result in a lower volume of corresponding loan originations or other administrative costs which may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or could cause us to take other actions that would be materially detrimental. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain in conservatorship and a path forward for them to emerge from conservatorship is unclear. Their roles could be reduced, modified or eliminated as a result of regulatory actions and the nature of their guarantees could be limited or eliminated relative to historical measurements. The elimination or modification of the traditional roles of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac could create additional competition in the market and significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Changes in the servicing, origination, or underwriting guidelines or criteria required by the Agencies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We are required to follow specific guidelines or criteria that impact the way we originate, underwrite or service loans. Guidelines include credit standards for mortgage loans, our staffing levels and other servicing practices, the servicing and ancillary fees that we may charge, modification standards and procedures, and the amount of non-reimbursable advances. We cannot negotiate these terms, which are subject to change at any time, with the Agencies. A significant change in these guidelines, which decreases the fees we charge or requires us to expend additional resources in providing mortgage services, could decrease our revenues or increase our costs, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, changes in the nature or extent of the guarantees provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or the insurance provided by the FHA could also have broad adverse market implications. The fees that we are required to pay to the Agencies for these guarantees have changed significantly over time and any future increases in these fees would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Future sales or issuances of our common stock or other securities (including warrants) or the issuance of securities pursuant to the exercise of warrants issued by us may dilute existing holders of our common stock and other securities, decrease the value of our common stock and other securities and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and other securities. 

During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company took decisive actions to build capital, reinforce our balance sheet, strengthen our risk management processes, and better align the Company with relevant bank peers. We significantly built our reserve levels by recording a $552 million provision for loan losses, bringing our allowance for credit losses to $992 million at December 31, 2023, reflecting our actions to build reserves during the quarter to address weakness in the office sector, potential repricing risk in the multi-family portfolio and an increase in classified assets, which better aligns the Company with its relevant bank peers, including Category IV banks. We are also subject to regulatory capital requirements and regulatory changes could result in more stringent capital or liquidity requirements, including increases in the levels of regulatory capital we are required to maintain and changes in the way capital or liquidity is measured for regulatory purposes. Accordingly, we may seek to raise additional capital, including by pursuing or effecting additional issuances of our securities. Our ability to 

raise additional capital (and the associated terms) depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the financial services and banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. 

On March 11, 2024, we completed an approximately $1.05 billion equity investment in the Company in connection with which we sold and issued (a) 76,630,965 shares of our common stock, at a purchase price per share of $2.00, (b) 192,062 shares of a new series of our preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, designated as Series B Noncumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, at a price per share of $2,000, each share of which is convertible into 1,000 shares of common stock, (c) 256,307 shares of a new series of our preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, designated as Series C Noncumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, at a price per share of $2,000, each share of which is convertible into 1,000 shares of common stock, and (d) warrants, which may not be exercised until 180 days after issuance thereof, affording the holder thereof the right, until the seven-year anniversary of the issuance of such warrant, to purchase for $2,500 per share, shares of a new class of non-voting, common-equivalent preferred stock of the Company, each share of which is convertible into 1,000 shares of common stock, and all of which shares of Series D NVCE Stock, upon issuance, will represent the right (on an as converted basis) to receive 315 million shares of common stock. Additionally, if the Company is not able to obtain certain approvals from our stockholders on or before September 9, 2024, then the Company will be required to issue to the investors in the March 2024 capital raise cash-settled warrants, which would become exercisable 60 days after their issuance if the such stockholder approvals still have not been obtained at such time, that provide the holder thereof the right, until the ten-year anniversary of the issuance of such warrant, to receive from the Company cash in an amount equal to (i) from issuance thereof until (and including) November 5, 2024, 160 percent of such holder&#8217;s investment in the Company in the March 2024 capital raise; (ii) on (and including) November 6, 2024 until (and including) January 4, 2025, 180 percent of such holder&#8217;s investment in the Company in the March 2024 capital raise; (iii) on (and including) January 5, 2025 until (and including) March 5, 2025, 200 percent of such holder&#8217;s investment in the Company in the March 2024 capital raise; and (iv) from and after March 6, 2025, 220 percent of such holder&#8217;s investment in the Company in the March 2024 capital raise, in each case, net of the exercise price (which is the amount of such holder&#8217;s investment in the Company in the March 2024 capital raise). 

Our Board of Directors has the authority, in many situations, to issue additional shares of authorized but unissued stock (including securities convertible or exchangeable for stock) in public or private offerings without any vote of our shareholders. If, in the future, the Company is required or otherwise determines to raise additional capital (including through the issuance of additional securities), any such capital raise or issuance may dilute the percentage of ownership interest of existing shareholders, may dilute the per share book value of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and other securities. No assurance can be given that, in the future, the Company will be able to (i) raise any required capital or (ii) raise capital on terms that are beneficial to shareholders. 

Strategic Risks 

Extensive competition for loans and deposits could adversely affect our ability to expand our business, as well as our financial condition and results of operations. 

Because our profitability stems from our ability to attract deposits and originate loans, our continued ability to compete for depositors and borrowers is critical to our success. Our success as a competitor depends on a number of factors, including our ability to develop, maintain, and build long-term relationships with our customers by providing them with convenience, in the form of multiple branch locations, extended hours of service, and access through alternative delivery channels; a broad and diverse selection of products and services; interest rates and service fees that compare favorably with those of our competitors; and skilled and knowledgeable personnel to assist our customers by addressing their financial needs. External factors that may impact our ability to compete include, among others, the entry of new lenders and depository institutions in our current markets and, with regard to lending, an increased focus on multi-family and CRE lending by existing competitors. 

Limitations on our ability to grow our loan portfolios could adversely affect our ability to generate interest income, as well our financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially. 

Our portfolios of multi-family and CRE loans represent the largest portion of our asset mix (56 percent of total loans held for investment as of December 31, 2023). Our leadership position in these markets has been instrumental to our production of solid earnings and our consistent record of exceptional asset quality. We monitor the ratio of our multi-family, CRE, and ADC loans (as defined in the CRE Guidance) to our total risk-based capital for compliance with regulatory guidance. Any inability to grow our multi-family and CRE loan portfolios, could negatively impact our ability to grow our earnings per share. 

The inability to engage in merger transactions, or to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions in which we might engage, could adversely affect our ability to compete with other financial institutions and weaken our financial performance. 

Our ability to engage in future mergers and acquisitions depends on our ability to identify suitable merger partners and acquisition opportunities, our ability to finance and complete negotiated transactions at acceptable prices and on acceptable terms, and our ability to obtain the necessary stockholder and regulatory approvals. If we are unable to engage in or complete a desired acquisition or merger transaction, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. As acquisitions have been a significant source of deposits, the inability to complete a business combination could require that we increase the interest rates we pay on deposits in order to attract such funding through our current branch network, or that we increase our use of wholesale funds. Increasing our cost of funds could adversely impact our net interest income and our net income. Furthermore, the absence of acquisitions could impact our ability to fulfill our loan demand. In addition, mergers and acquisitions can lead to uncertainties about the future on the part of customers and employees. Such uncertainties could cause customers and others to consider changing their existing business relationships with the company to be acquired, and could cause its employees to accept positions with other companies before the merger occurs. As a result, the ability of a company to attract and retain customers, and to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel, prior to a merger&#8217;s completion could be impaired. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that acquired operations would not adversely affect our existing profitability; that we would be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by our existing banking business; that we would be able to compete effectively in the market areas served by acquired branches; or that we would be able to manage any growth resulting from a transaction effectively. In particular, our ability to compete effectively in new markets would be dependent on our ability to understand those markets and their competitive dynamics, and our ability to retain certain key employees from the acquired institution who know those markets better than we do. 

We may be exposed to challenges in combining the operations of acquired or merged businesses, including our recent Flagstar acquisition and Signature acquisition, into our operations, which may prevent us from achieving the expected benefits from our merger and acquisition activities. 

We may not be able to fully achieve the strategic objectives and operating efficiencies that we anticipate in our merger and acquisition activities. Inherent uncertainties exist in integrating the operations of an acquired business. We may lose our customers or the customers of acquired entities as a result of the acquisitions. We may also lose key personnel from the acquired entity as a result of an acquisition. We may not discover all known and unknown factors when examining a company for acquisition or merger during the due diligence period. These factors could produce unintended and unexpected consequences for us including, but not limited to, increased compliance and legal risks, including increased litigation or regulatory actions such as fines or restrictions related to the business practices or operations of the combined business. Undiscovered factors as a result of an acquisition or merger could bring civil, criminal, and financial liabilities against us, our management, and the management of those entities we acquire or merge with. In addition, if difficulties arise with respect to the integration process, we may incur higher integration expenses than anticipated and the economic benefits expected to result from the acquisition, including revenue growth and cost savings, might not occur or might not occur to the extent we expected. Failure to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire or merge with could have an adverse effect on our profitability, return on equity, return on assets, or our ability to implement our strategy, any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The success of the Signature transaction will depend on a number of uncertain factors, including our decisions regarding the fair value of the assets acquired and the bargain purchase gain recorded on the transaction, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. 

Our acquisition of certain assets of Signature Bank in March 2023 was an FDIC-assisted transaction and the expedited nature of the FDIC-assisted transaction did not allow bidders the time and access to information customarily associated with preparing for and evaluating a negotiated transaction. As a result, fair value estimates we have made in connection with the Signature transaction may be inaccurate and subject to change, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. In addition, we may obtain additional information and evidence during the period of one year from March 20, 2023, the date we completed the Signature transaction, that may result in changes to the estimated amounts recorded as of December 31, 2023, which could change the amount of the bargain purchase gain we have recorded. Adjustments to this gain may be recorded based on additional information received after the acquisition date that affect the measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and any decrease in the amount of bargain purchase gain we have recorded could also adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. 

Operational Risks 

Our stress testing processes rely on analytical and forecasting models that may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate, which could adversely affect the effectiveness of our strategic planning and our ability to pursue certain corporate goals. 

The processes we use to estimate the effects of changing interest rates, real estate values, and economic indicators such as unemployment on our financial condition and results of operations depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Furthermore, even if our assumptions are accurate predictors of future performance, the models they are based on may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or implementation. If the models we use in the process of managing our interest rate and other risks prove to be inadequate or inaccurate, we could incur increased or unexpected losses which, in turn, could adversely affect our earnings and capital. Additionally, failure by the Company to maintain compliance with strict capital, liquidity, and other stress test requirements under banking regulations could subject us to regulatory sanctions, including limitations on our ability to pay dividends. 

The Company, entities that we have acquired, and certain of our service providers have experienced information technology security breaches and may be vulnerable to future security breaches. These incidents have resulted in, and could result in, additional expenses, exposure to civil litigation, increased regulatory scrutiny, losses, and a loss of customers, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of our stock. 

Communication and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems, and those maintained and provided to us by third-party service providers, to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger, our deposits, and our loans. In addition, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we, and entities we have acquired, take and have taken protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks, as well as the security of the computer systems, software, and networks of certain of our service providers, have been, and may in the future be, vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that have had and could have an impact on information security. With the rise and permeation of online and mobile banking, the financial services industry in particular faces substantial cybersecurity risk due to the type of sensitive information provided by customers. We, and our third-party service providers, have been and may in the future be subject to cybersecurity incidents, including those that involve the unauthorized access to customer information affecting other financial institutions and industry groups. Our systems and those of our third-party service providers and customers are regularly the subject of attempted attacks that are increasingly sophisticated, and it is possible that we or they could experience a significant event in the future that could adversely affect our business or operations. In addition, breaches of security have in the past and may in the future occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or unauthorized access to our confidential or other information, or that of our customers, clients, or counterparties. Certain previously identified cyber incidents have resulted, and future such events could result, in the breach of confidential and other information processed and stored in our computer systems and networks. These events could cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers, clients, or counterparties. Further, we may not know that an attack occurred until well after the event. Even after discovering an attempt or breach occurred, we may not know the extent of the impact of the attack for some period of time. This could cause us significant reputational damage or result in our experiencing significant losses. 

While we diligently assess applicable regulatory and legislative developments affecting our business, laws and regulations relating to cybersecurity have been frequently changing, imposing new requirements on us. In light of these conditions, we face the potential for additional regulatory scrutiny that will lead to increasing compliance and technology expenses and, in some cases, possible limitations on the achievement of our plans for growth and other strategic objectives. We may also be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks, including expenses for third-party expert consultants or outside counsel. We are currently subject to litigation regarding cyber incidents, and we also may be subject to future litigation and financial losses that either are not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance we maintain or any third-party indemnification or insurance. We believe that the impact of any previously identified cyber incidents, including those subject to ongoing investigation and remediation, will not have a material financial impact. 

In addition, we routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential, and proprietary information by e-mail and other electronic means. We have discussed, and worked with our customers, clients, and counterparties to develop secure transmission capabilities, but we do not have, and may be unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all of these constituents, and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure we will timely and sufficiently 

notify our investors of material cybersecurity risks and incidents, including the associated financial, legal, or reputational consequence of such an event, as well as reviewing and updating any prior disclosures relating to the risk or event. While we have established information security policies, procedures and controls, including an Incident Response Plan, to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions, we may not be able to anticipate all possible security breaches that could affect our systems or information and there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or will be adequately prevented or mitigated by our policies, procedures and controls if they do. 

The Company and the Bank rely on third parties to perform certain key business functions, which may expose us to further operational risk. 

We outsource certain key aspects of our data processing to certain third-party providers. While we have selected these third-party providers carefully, we cannot control their actions. Our ability to deliver products and services to our customers, to adequately process and account for our customers&#8217; transactions, or otherwise conduct our business could be adversely impacted by any disruption in the services provided by these third parties; their failure to handle current or higher volumes of usage; or any difficulties we may encounter in communicating with them. Replacing these third-party providers also could entail significant delay and expense. Our third-party providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, and other security breaches. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other third-party providers and their personnel. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by such security breaches or viruses. To the extent that the activities of our third-party providers or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and other possible liabilities. These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and oversight by federal bank regulators (such as the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) and the CFPB. As a result, if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over vendors and subcontractors or other ongoing third-party business relationships or that such third-parties have not performed appropriately, we could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines, as well as requirements for consumer remediation. In addition, the Company may not be adequately insured against all types of losses resulting from third-party failures, and our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from systems failures or other disruptions to our banking services. 

Failure to keep pace with technological changes could have a material adverse impact on our ability to compete for loans and deposits, and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Financial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of our competitors have greater resources than we do and may be better equipped to invest in and market new technology-driven products and services. 

The inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely impact our operations. 

To a large degree, our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel whose expertise, knowledge of our markets, and years of industry experience make them difficult to replace. Competition for skilled leaders in our industry can be intense, and we may not be able to hire or retain the people we would like to have working for us. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business, given the specialized knowledge of such personnel and the difficulty of finding qualified replacements on a timely basis. Furthermore, our ability to attract and retain personnel with the skills and knowledge to support our business may require that we offer additional compensation and benefits that would reduce our earnings. 

The transition to a new Chief Executive Officer will be critical to our success and our business may be adversely impacted if we do not successfully manage the transition process in a timely manner. 

Our success depends, in part, on the effectiveness of our transition to our new CEO, Joseph M. Otting, on April 1, 2024. The new CEO will be critical to executing on and achieving our vision, strategic direction, culture, products, and technology. If we are unable to execute an orderly transition and successfully integrate the new CEO into our leadership team, our operations and financial conditions may be adversely affected. 

Many aspects of our operations are dependent upon the soundness of other financial intermediaries and thus could expose us to systemic risk. 

The soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of relationships between them involving credit, trading, execution of transactions, and the like. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses, or defaults by other institutions. As such &#8220;systemic risk&#8221; may adversely affect the financial intermediaries with which we interact on a daily basis (such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, and securities firms and exchanges), we could be adversely impacted as well. 

We may be terminated as a servicer or subservicer or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions. 

At December 31, 2023, we had relationships with 10 owners of MSRs, excluding ourselves, for which we act as subservicer for the mortgage loans they own. Due to the limited number of relationships, discontinuation of existing agreements with those third parties or adverse changes in contractual terms could have a significant negative impact to our mortgage servicing revenue. The terms and conditions in which a master servicer may terminate subservicing contracts are broad and could be exercised at the discretion of the master servicer without requiring cause. Additionally, the master servicer directs the oversight of custodial deposits associated with serviced loans and, to the extent allowable, could choose to transfer the oversight of the Bank's custodial deposits to another depository institution. Further, as servicer or subservicer of loans, we have certain contractual obligations, including foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent applicable, considering alternatives to foreclosure. If we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, causing us to lose servicing income. 

We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans, pay fees or indemnify buyers against losses. 

When selling mortgage loans, we provide customary representations and warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including the Agencies, regarding loan originations. Agreements may require repurchasing, substituting mortgage loans, or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event we breach these representations or warranties. We may also face litigation and associated costs. With respect to loans that are originated through our broker or correspondent channels, the remedies against originating brokers or correspondents may be limited, posing financial risk. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may also be adversely affected. Additionally, servicing errors may lead to reimbursement obligations, we may have a significant reduction to noninterest income or an increase to noninterest expense. We may incur legal and document-related expenses from foreclosure actions. These challenges could harm our reputation or negatively affect our servicing business and, as a result, our profitability. 

The pipeline represents the UPB for loans the Agencies identified as potentially needing to be repurchased, and the estimated probable loss associated with these loans is included in our representation and warranty reserve. While we believe the level of the reserve to be appropriate, the reserve may not be adequate to cover losses for loans that we have sold or securitized for which we may be subsequently required to repurchase, pay fines or fees, or indemnify purchasers and insurers because of violations of customary representations and warranties. Additionally, the pipeline could increase substantially without warning. Our regulators, as part of their supervisory function, may review our representation and warranty reserve for losses and may recommend or require us to increase our reserve, based upon their judgment, which may differ from that of Management. 

We utilize third-party mortgage originators which subjects us to strategic, reputation, compliance, and operational risk. 

We utilize third-party mortgage originators, i.e. mortgage brokers and correspondent lenders, who are not our employees. These third parties originate mortgages or provide services to many different banks and other entities. Accordingly, they may have relationships with, or loyalties to, such banks and other parties that are different from those they have with or to us. Failure to maintain good relations with such third-party mortgage originators could have a negative impact on our market share which would negatively impact our results of operations. We rely on third-party mortgage originators to originate and document the mortgage loans we purchase or originate. While we perform due diligence on the mortgage companies with whom we do business as well as review the loan files and loan documents we purchase to attempt to detect any irregularities or legal noncompliance, we have less control over these originators than employees of the Bank. Due to regulatory scrutiny, our third-party mortgage originators could choose or be required to either reduce the scope of their business or exit the mortgage origination business altogether. The TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule issued by the CFPB establishes comprehensive mortgage disclosure requirements for lenders and settlement agents in connection with most closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property. The rule requires certain disclosures to be provided to consumers in connection with applying for and closing on a mortgage loan. The rule also mandates the use of specific disclosure forms, timing of 

communicating information to borrowers, and certain record keeping requirements. The ongoing administrative burden and the system requirements associated with complying with these rules or potential changes to these rules could impact our mortgage volume and increase costs. These arrangements with third-party mortgage originators and the fees payable by us to such third parties could also be subject to future regulatory scrutiny and restrictions. 

The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, The Consumer Protection Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit discriminatory and other lending practices by lenders, including financial institutions. Mortgage and consumer lending practices raise compliance risks resulting from the detailed and complex nature of mortgage and consumer lending laws and regulations imposed by federal Regulatory Agencies as well as the relatively independent and diverse operating channels in which loans are originated. As we originate loans through various channels, we, and our third-party originators, are especially impacted by these laws and regulations and are required to implement appropriate policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with fair lending laws and regulations and to avoid lending practices that result in the disparate treatment of, or disparate impact to, borrowers across our various locations under multiple channels. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, by us, or our third-party originators, could result in the Bank being liable for damages to individual borrowers, changes in business practices, or other imposed penalties. 

We are subject to various legal or regulatory investigations and proceedings. 

At any given time, we are involved with a number of legal and regulatory examinations as a part of reviews conducted by regulators and other parties, which may involve banking, securities, consumer protection, employment, tort, and numerous other laws and regulations. Proceedings or actions brought against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, business improvement orders, consent orders, supervisory agreements, restrictions on our business activities, or other results adverse to us, which could materially and negatively affect our business. If such claims and other matters are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject may provide a private right of action that a consumer or class of consumers may pursue to enforce these laws and regulations. We are currently subject to stockholder class and derivative actions which seek significant damages and other relief, and may be subject to similar actions in the future. Any financial liability or reputational damage could have a materially adverse effect on our business and, in turn, on our financial condition and results of operations. Claims asserted against us can be highly complicated and slow to develop, making the outcome of such proceedings difficult to predict or estimate early in the process. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that we will be exposed to a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny relating to our business and operations. Although we establish accruals for legal or regulatory proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal or regulatory proceedings where we face a risk of loss. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal and regulatory proceedings in question. As a result, our ultimate losses may be significantly higher than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies. For further information, see Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies and Item 3 - Legal Proceedings. 

We may be required to pay interest on certain mortgage escrow accounts in accordance with certain state laws despite the Federal preemption under the National Bank Act. 

In 2018, the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals held that California state law requiring mortgage servicers to pay interest on certain mortgage escrow accounts was not, as a matter of law, preempted by the National Bank Act ( Lusnak v. Bank of America ). This ruling goes against the position that regulators, national banks, and other federally-chartered financial institutions have taken regarding the preemption of state-law mortgage escrow interest requirements. The opinion issued by the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals is legal precedent only in certain parts of the western United States. We are defending similar litigation in California, and are currently appealing a federal district court judgment against us in that case to the Ninth Circuit. We are arguing that the Lusnak case was wrongly decided; we believe our situation can be distinguished from Lusnak as a matter of law and California&#8217;s interest on escrow law should be preempted as a matter of fact. If the Ninth Circuit&#8217;s holding is more broadly adopted by other Federal Circuits, including those covering states that currently have enacted, or in the future may enact, statutes requiring the payment of interest on escrow balances or if we would be required to retroactively credit interest on escrow funds, the Company&#8217;s earnings could be adversely affected. 

We could be exposed to fraud risks that affect our operations and reputation. 

We face significant risks related to fraud, which could result in financial loss, expensive litigation, and damage to our reputation. Our organization is exposed to various types of fraud, including fraud or theft by colleagues or outsiders and unauthorized transactions. We rely heavily on information provided by clients and third parties, and misrepresentations in this information can lead to funding loans that do not meet our expectations or on unfavorable terms. We bear the risk of loss associated with misrepresentations, and it can be challenging to recover any monetary losses suffered. We have implemented various controls and security measures, but the failure of any of these controls could result in a failure to detect or mitigate fraud risks in a timely manner. We are committed to ongoing investments and attention to combat fraud and enhance our security measures to protect against these risks. 

Reputational Risk 

Damage to our reputation could significantly harm the businesses we engage in, as well as our competitive position and prospects for growth. 

Our ability to attract and retain investors, customers, clients, and employees could be adversely affected by damage to our reputation resulting from various sources, including employee misconduct, litigation, or regulatory outcomes; failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality; compliance failures; unintentional disproportionate assessment of fees to customers of protected classes; unethical behavior; unintended disclosure of confidential information; and the activities of our clients, customers, and/or counterparties. Actions by the financial services industry in general, or by certain entities or individuals within it, also could have a significantly adverse impact on our reputation. Our actual or perceived failure to identify and address various issues also could give rise to reputational risk that could significantly harm us and our business prospects, including failure to properly address operational risks. These issues include legal and regulatory requirements; consumer protection, fair lending, and privacy issues; properly maintaining customer and associated personal information; record keeping; protecting against money laundering; sales and trading practices; and ethical issues. 

Increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social, and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks. 

Companies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds, and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions, and human rights. Increased ESG-related compliance costs could result in increases to our overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, and our stock price. New government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure. Additionally, concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Investors, consumers, and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. The Company and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as investor, consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. The Company and its customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, and operating process changes, among other impacts. The impact on the Company&#8217;s customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. In addition, the Company would face reductions in credit worthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. Investors could determine not to invest in the Company&#8217;s securities due to various climate change related considerations. The Company&#8217;s efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions may not be effective in protecting the Company from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in investor, consumer or business behavior.
