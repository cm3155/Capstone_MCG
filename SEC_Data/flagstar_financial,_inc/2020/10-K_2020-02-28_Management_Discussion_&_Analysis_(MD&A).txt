 ITEM 7. 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

##TABLE_END &#160;

For the purpose of this discussion and analysis, the words &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; and the &#8220;Company&#8221; are used to refer to New York Community Bancorp, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries, including New York Community Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). 

Executive Summary 

New York Community Bancorp, Inc. is the holding company for New York Community Bank, with 238 branches in Metro New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Florida, and Arizona. At December 31, 2019, we had total assets of $53.6 billion, including total loans of $41.7 billion, total deposits of $31.7 billion, and total stockholders&#8217; equity of $6.7 billion. 

Chartered in the State of New York, the Bank is subject to regulation by the FDIC, the CFPB, and the NYSDFS. In addition, the holding company is subject to regulation by the FRB, the SEC, and to the requirements of the NYSE, where shares of our common stock are traded under the symbol &#8220;NYCB&#8221; and shares of our preferred stock trade under the symbol &#8220;NYCB PA.&#8221; 

As a publicly traded company, our mission is to provide our shareholders with a solid return on their investment by producing a strong financial performance, maintaining a solid capital position, and engaging in corporate strategies that enhance the value of their shares. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company reported net income of $395.0 million, compared to the $422.4 million reported for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. Net income available to common shareholders in the comparable period was $362.2 million, versus $389.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.77 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $0.79 per diluted common share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. 

The key trends during 2019 were: 

Continued Growth in Our Loan Portfolio 

At December 31, 2019 the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio totaled $41.7 billion, up $1.7 billion or a 4.4% increase compared to the balance at December 31, 2018. The year-over-year growth in our loan portfolio was due to growth in the multi-family portfolio, the specialty finance portfolio (which is part of our C&#38;I loan portfolio), and the CRE portfolio. 

Fueled by $6.0 billion in originations and $770.8 million of repurchases, the multi-family portfolio increased $1.3 billion or 4.3% to $31.2 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to $29.9 billion at December 31, 2018, and it accounted for most of the loan growth during the current year. The specialty finance portfolio had another strong year, growing $675.8 million or 35% on a year-over-year basis to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2019, while the CRE portfolio increased $83.5 million or 1% to $7.1 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. 

Inflection Point for the NIM and Net Interest Income 

Both net interest income and the NIM declined on a year-over-year basis, but they increased during the fourth quarter of 2019, marking the first time since the end of 2015 that both of these metrics increased. The primary driver of the increase was lower funding costs which led to lower interest expense, which, in turn, drove the growth in net interest income. The NIM rose five basis points to 2.04% on a linked-quarter basis as net interest income improved $6.6 million to $242.5 million or 11% annualized compared to the third quarter of 2019. 

Operating Expenses Decline Further 

Our cost-cutting efforts continued to pay off in 2019. After declining nearly $95 million during the course of 2018, total non-interest

expense declined a further $35.4 million or 6.5% over the course of 2019. In 2019, non-interest

expense included $10.4 million of certain items related to severance costs and branch rationalization costs.

Asset Quality Remained Exceptional During the Current Year 

The Company&#8217;s asset quality metrics remained strong during full-year 2019. Total NPAs were $73.5 million or 0.14% of total assets, while non-performing

loans were $61.2 million or 0.15% of total loans. Included in these amounts was $30.4 million of non-accrual

taxi medallion-related loans. Repossessed assets were $12.3 million at year-end

2019 and included $10.3 million of repossessed taxi medallions at that time period.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $19.3 million of net charge-offs or 0.05% of average loans. This figure included $10.2 million of charge-offs related to the taxi medallion portfolio. Importantly, on a combined basis, we only recorded $659,000 of charge-offs in the MF/CRE loan portfolios or 0.00% of average loans. 

External Factors 

The following is a discussion of certain external factors that tend to influence our financial performance and the strategic actions we take. 

Interest Rates 

Among the external factors that tend to influence our performance, the interest rate environment is key. Just as short-term interest rates affect the cost of our deposits and that of the funds we borrow, market interest rates affect the yields on the loans we produce for investment and the securities in which we invest. 

As further discussed under &#8220;Loans Held for Investment&#8221; later on in this discussion, the interest rates on our multi-family loans and CRE credits generally are based on the five-year and seven-year CMT. The following table summarizes the high, low, and average five- and seven-year CMT rates in 2019 and 2018:

&#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;

Because the multi-family and CRE loans we produce generate income when they prepay (which is recorded as interest income), the impact of repayment activity can be especially meaningful. In 2019, prepayment income from loans contributed $48.9 million to interest income; in the prior year, the contribution was $44.9 million. 

Economic Indicators 

While we attribute our asset quality to the nature of the loans we produce and our conservative underwriting standards, the quality of our assets can also be impacted by economic conditions in our local markets and throughout the United States. The information that follows consists of recent economic data that we consider to be germane to our performance and the markets we serve.

Economic activity also is indicated by the Consumer Confidence Index &#174;

, which moved up to 128.2 in December 2019 from 126.2 in December 2018. An index level of 90 or more is considered indicative of a strong economy. 

The following chart illustrates the relative stability of the rental vacancy rate in New York City for all rental units and for rent stabilized units, from 1991 through 2017, as compared to the changes in average unemployment rates in New York City during those years. As the New York City rental vacancy rate is only reported every three years, the annual average unemployment rate in New York City is provided for those years only. As you can see the vacancy rates for rent stabilized units are lower, in some years, meaningfully lower, then the vacancy rates for all rental units.

Recent Events 

Dividend Declaration 

On January 28, 2020, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the Company&#8217;s common stock of $0.17 per share, payable on February 24, 2020 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on February 10, 2020. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

We consider certain accounting policies to be critically important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, since they require management to make complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. The inherent sensitivity of our consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies, and the judgments, estimates, and assumptions used therein, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 

We have identified the following to be critical accounting policies: the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the determination of the amount, if any, of goodwill impairment. 

The judgments used by management in applying these critical accounting policies may be influenced by adverse changes in the economic environment, which may result in changes to future financial results. 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable and estimable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the date of the balance sheet. Losses on loans are charged against, and recoveries of losses on loans are credited back to, the allowance for loan losses. 

The methodology used for the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was generally comparable, whereby the Bank segregated their loss factors (used for both criticized and non-criticized

loans) into a component that was primarily based on historical loss rates and a component that was primarily based on other qualitative factors that are probable to affect loan collectability. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management considers the Bank&#8217;s current business strategies and credit processes, including compliance with applicable regulatory guidelines and with guidelines approved by the Boards of Directors with regard to credit limitations, loan approvals, underwriting criteria, and loan workout procedures.

The allowance for loan losses is established based on management&#8217;s evaluation of incurred losses in the portfolio in accordance with GAAP, and is comprised of both specific valuation allowances and a general valuation allowance. 

Specific valuation allowances are established based on management&#8217;s analyses of individual loans that are considered impaired. If a loan is deemed to be impaired, management measures the extent of the impairment and establishes a specific valuation allowance for that amount. A loan is classified as impaired when, based on current information and/or events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. We apply this classification as necessary to loans individually evaluated for impairment in our portfolios. Smaller-balance homogenous loans and loans carried at the lower of cost or fair value are evaluated for impairment on a collective, rather than individual, basis. Loans to certain borrowers who have experienced financial difficulty and for which the terms have been modified, resulting in a concession, are considered TDRs and are classified as impaired. 

We primarily measure impairment on an individual loan and determine the extent to which a specific valuation allowance is necessary by comparing the loan&#8217;s outstanding balance to either the fair value of the collateral, less the estimated cost to sell, or the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate. Generally, when the fair value of the collateral, net of the estimated cost to sell, or the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the recorded investment in the loan, any shortfall is promptly charged off. 

We also follow a process to assign the general valuation allowance to loan categories. The general valuation allowance is established by applying our loan loss provisioning methodology, and reflect the inherent risk in outstanding held-for-investment

loans. This loan loss provisioning methodology considers various factors in determining the appropriate quantified risk factors to use to determine the general valuation allowance. The factors assessed begin with the historical loan loss experience for each major loan category. We also take into account an estimated historical loss emergence period (which is the period of time between the event that triggers a loss and the confirmation and/or charge-off

of that loss) for each loan portfolio segment.

The allocation methodology consists of the following components: First, we determine an allowance for loan losses based on a quantitative loss factor for loans evaluated collectively for impairment. This quantitative loss factor is based primarily on historical loss rates, after considering loan type, historical loss and delinquency experience, and loss emergence periods. The quantitative loss factors applied in the methodology are periodically re-evaluated

and adjusted to reflect changes in historical loss levels, loss emergence periods, or other risks. Lastly, we allocate an allowance for loan losses based on qualitative loss factors. These qualitative loss factors are designed to account for losses that may not be provided for by the quantitative loss component due to other factors evaluated by management, which include, but are not limited to:

and recovery practices; ##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#8226; The effect of other external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements, on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio. ##TABLE_END &#160;

By considering the factors discussed above, we determine an allowance for loan losses that is applied to each significant loan portfolio segment to determine the total allowance for loan losses. 

The historical loss period we use to determine the allowance for loan losses on loans is a rolling 36-quarter look-back period, as we believe this produces an appropriate reflection of our historical loss experience. 

The process of establishing the allowance for losses on loans also involves: 

##TABLE_START &#160; &#8226; Periodic inspections of the loan collateral by qualified in-house

and external property appraisers/inspectors; ##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#8226; Regular meetings of executive management with the pertinent Board committees, during which observable trends in the local economy and/or the real estate market are discussed; ##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#8226; Assessment of the aforementioned factors by the pertinent members of the Board of Directors and management when making a business judgment regarding the impact of anticipated changes on the future level of loan losses; and ##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#8226; Analysis of the portfolio in the aggregate, as well as on an individual loan basis, taking into consideration payment history, underwriting analyses, and internal risk ratings. ##TABLE_END &#160;

In order to determine their overall adequacy, the loan loss allowance is reviewed quarterly by management Board Committees and the Board of Directors of the Bank, as applicable. 

We charge off loans, or portions of loans, in the period that such loans, or portions thereof, are deemed uncollectible. The collectability of individual loans is determined through an assessment of the financial condition and repayment capacity of the borrower and/or through an estimate of the fair value of any underlying collateral. For non-real

estate-related consumer credits, the following past-due

time periods determine when charge-offs are typically recorded: (1) closed-end

credits are charged off in the quarter that the loan becomes 120 days past due; (2) open-end

credits are charged off in the quarter that the loan becomes 180 days past due; and (3) both closed-end

and open-end

credits are typically charged off in the quarter that the credit is 60 days past the date we received notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy.

The level of future additions to the respective loan loss allowance is based on many factors, including certain factors that are beyond management&#8217;s control, such as changes in economic and local market conditions, including declines in real estate values, and increases in vacancy rates and unemployment. Management uses the best available information to recognize losses on loans or to make additions to the loan loss allowance; however, the Bank may be required to take certain charge-offs and/or recognize further additions to the loan loss allowance, based on the judgment of regulatory agencies with regard to information provided during their examinations of the Bank. 

An allowance for unfunded commitments is maintained separate from the allowance for loan losses and is included in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. 

See Note 6, Allowance for Loan Losses for a further discussion of our allowance for loan losses. 

Goodwill Impairment 

We have significant intangible assets related to goodwill. As of December 31, 2019, we had goodwill of $2.4 billion. In connection with our acquisitions, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets. Our goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually as of year-end

or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. These impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We have identified one reporting unit which is the same as our operating segment and reportable segment. If we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments may change, which may result in adjustments to the recorded goodwill balance.

For annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If we conclude that this is the case, we must perform the two-step

test described below. If we conclude based on the qualitative assessment that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we have completed our goodwill impairment test and do not need to perform the two-step

test.

Step one requires the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value in order to identify potential impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of its net assets, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit, potential impairment is indicated at the reporting unit level and step two of the impairment test is performed. 

Step two requires that when potential impairment is indicated in step one, we compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires a valuation of the reporting unit&#8217;s tangible and (non-goodwill)

intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination. Any excess in the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, no triggering events were identified that indicated that the value of goodwill may be impaired. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company&#8217;s annual goodwill impairment assessment, using step one of the quantitative test, found no indication of goodwill impairment. 

Income Taxes 

In estimating income taxes, management assesses the relative merits and risks of the tax treatment of transactions, taking into account statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position. In this process, management also relies on tax opinions, recent audits, and historical experience. Although we use the best available information to record income taxes, underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances such as changes in tax laws and judicial guidance influencing our overall or transaction-specific tax position. 

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and the carryforward of certain tax attributes such as net operating losses. A valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to be unrealizable, based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income, considering the prudence and feasibility of tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates, and future taxable income levels. 

In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made. Conversely, if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease in income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made. Subsequently recognized tax benefits associated with valuation allowances recorded in a business combination would be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Balance Sheet Summary 

At December 31, 2019, total assets were $53.6 billion, up $1.7 billion or 3.4% on a year-over-year basis. Our asset growth was largely the result of loan growth and to a much lesser extent, growth in the securities portfolio. This was funded through a combination of growth in deposits and in wholesale borrowings, and by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. 

Total loans held for investment rose $1.7 billion or 4.3% on a year-over-year basis to $41.9 billion, as the multi-family loan portfolio increased $1.3 billion or 4.3% to $31.2 billion and the C&#38;I loan portfolio rose $626.0 million or 26.2% to $3.0 billion. 

Total securities, consisting mainly of available-for-sale

securities increased $241.8 million or 4.3% on a year-over-year basis, to $5.9 billion.

On the liability side, total deposits rose $892.7 million or 2.9% to $31.7 billion compared to the balance at year-end

2018, while total borrowed funds increased $349.7 million or 2.5% to $14.6 billion. Most of the growth in borrowings occurred in the fourth quarter of the year.

Total stockholders&#8217; equity at December 31, 2019 was $6.7 billion, relatively unchanged compared to the balance at December 31, 2018. Common stockholders&#8217; equity to total assets was 11.57% compared to 11.85% at December 31, 2018. Book value per common share was $13.29 at December 31, 2019 compared to $12.99 at December 31, 2018. 

Excluding goodwill of $2.4 billion at both December 31, 2019 and 2018, tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity totaled $3.8 billion at year-end

2019, up $66.2 million or 1.8% compared to year-end

2018. Tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity to tangible assets was 7.39% at December 31, 2019 compared to 7.51% at December 31, 2018. Tangible book value per common share at December 31, 2019 was $8.09 compared to $7.85 at December 31, 2018.

Loans 

Loans Held for Investment 

The majority of the loans we produce are multi-family loans. Our production of multi-family loans began several decades ago in the five boroughs of New York City, where the majority of the rental units currently consist of rent-regulated apartments featuring below-market rents. 

In addition to multi-family loans, our loan portfolio contains a large number of CRE credits, most of which are secured by income-producing properties located in New York City and on Long Island. 

In addition to multi-family loans and CRE loans, our portfolio includes substantially smaller balances of one-to-four

family loans, ADC loans, and other loans held for investment, with C&#38;I loans comprising the bulk of the other loan portfolio. Specialty finance loans and leases account for most of our C&#38;I credits, with the remainder consisting primarily of loans to small and mid-size 

businesses, referred to as other C&#38;I loans.

In 2019, we originated $10.6 billion of loans, a $540.5 million or a 5.4% increase from the prior year. The higher level of originations was largely driven by an increase in specialty finance originations and CRE originations, offset by a decline in multi-family originations. During full-year 2019, the Bank originated $6.0 billion of multi-family loans, down 9.7% compared to full-year 2018, while specialty finance loans grew $882.9 million or 46.1%, to $2.8 billion, and CRE originations increased $259.5 million or 26.8%. 

In addition to the strong origination volumes over the course of 2019, during the fourth quarter of the year, the Company also opportunistically repurchased $770.8 million of primarily multi-family loans it previously originated and sold to other financial institutions. These loans were originally sold by the Company in order to manage the balance sheet below the $50 billion in asset SIFI threshold in place at the time. 

Multi-Family Loans 

Multi-family loans are our principal asset. The loans we produce are primarily secured by non-luxury

residential apartment buildings in New York City that feature rent-regulated units and below-market rents&#8212;a market we refer to as our &#8220;primary lending niche.&#8221; Consistent with our emphasis on multi-family lending, multi-family loan originations represented $6.0 billion, or 56.4%, of the loans we produced for investment in 2019.

At December 31, 2019, multi-family loans represented $31.2 billion, or 74.5%, of total loans held for investment, reflecting a year-over-year increase of $1.3 billion, or 4.3% and the average multi-family loan had a principal balance of $6.4 million and $6.1 million; the expected weighted average life of the portfolio was 2.0 years at December 31, 2019 compared to 2.6 years at December 31, 2018. 

The majority of our multi-family loans were secured by rental apartment buildings. In addition, 77.9% of our multi-family loans were secured by buildings in the metro New York City area and 3.0% were secured by buildings elsewhere in New York State. The remaining multi-family loans were secured by buildings outside these markets, including in the four other states served by our retail branch offices. 

At December 31, 2019, $18.7 billion or 60.0% of the Company&#8217;s total multi-family loan portfolio is secured by properties in New York State and, therefore, are subject to the new rent regulation laws. The weighted average LTV of the NYS rent regulated multi-family portfolio was 53.17% as of December 31, 2019, compared to a weighted average LTV of 56.86% for the entire multi-family loan portfolio at that date. 

In addition to underwriting multi-family loans on the basis of the buildings&#8217; income and condition, we consider the borrowers&#8217; credit history, profitability, and building management expertise. Borrowers are required to present evidence of their ability to repay the loan from the buildings&#8217; current rent rolls, their financial statements, and related documents. 

While a percentage of our multi-family loans are ten-year

fixed rate credits, the vast majority of our multi-family loans feature a term of ten or twelve years, with a fixed rate of interest for the first five or seven years of the loan, and an alternative rate of interest in years six through ten or eight through twelve. The rate charged in the first five or seven years is generally based on intermediate-term interest rates plus a spread.

During the remaining years, the loan resets to an annually adjustable rate that is tied to the prime rate of interest, plus a spread. Alternately, the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the five-year fixed advance rate of the FHLB-NY,

plus a spread. The fixed-rate option also requires the payment of one percentage point of the then-outstanding loan balance. In either case, the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five-or

seven-year term. As the rent roll increases, the typical property owner seeks to refinance the mortgage, and generally does so before the loan reprices in year six or eight.

Multi-family loans that refinance within the first five or seven years are typically subject to an established prepayment penalty schedule. Depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment, the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the then-current loan balance. If a loan extends past the fifth or seventh year and the borrower selects the fixed-rate option, the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten or eight through twelve. For example, a ten-year

multi-family loan that prepays in year three would generally be expected to pay a prepayment penalty equal to three percentage points of the remaining principal balance. A twelve-year multi-family loan that prepays in year one or two would generally be expected to pay a penalty equal to five percentage points.

Because prepayment penalties are recorded as interest income, they are reflected in the average yields on our loans and interest-earning assets, our net interest rate spread and net interest margin, and the level of net interest income we record. No assumptions are involved in the recognition of prepayment income, as such income is only recorded when cash is received. 

Our success as a multi-family lender partly reflects the solid relationships we have developed with the market&#8217;s leading mortgage brokers, who are familiar with our lending practices, our underwriting standards, and our long-standing practice of basing our loans on the cash flows produced by the properties. The process of producing such loans is generally four to six weeks in duration and, because the multi-family market is largely broker-driven, the expense incurred in sourcing such loans is substantially reduced. 

Our emphasis on multi-family loans is driven by several factors, including their structure, which reduces our exposure to interest rate volatility to some degree. Another factor driving our focus on multi-family lending has been the comparative quality of the loans we produce. Reflecting the nature of the buildings securing our loans, our underwriting standards, and the generally conservative LTV ratios our multi-family loans feature at origination, a relatively small percentage of the multi-family loans that have transitioned to non-performing

status have actually resulted in losses, even when the credit cycle has taken a downward turn.

We primarily underwrite our multi-family loans based on the current cash flows produced by the collateral property, with a reliance on the &#8220;income&#8221; approach to appraising the properties, rather than the &#8220;sales&#8221; approach. The sales approach is subject to fluctuations in the real estate market, as well as general economic conditions, and is therefore likely to be more risky in the event of a downward credit cycle turn. We also consider a variety of other factors, including the physical condition of the underlying property; the net operating income of the mortgaged premises prior to debt service; the DSCR, which is the ratio of the property&#8217;s net operating income to its debt service; and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value (i.e., the LTV) of the property. 

In addition to requiring a minimum DSCR of 120% on multi-family buildings, we obtain a security interest in the personal property located on the premises, and an assignment of rents and leases. Our multi-family loans generally represent no more than 75% of the lower of the appraised value or the sales price of the underlying property, and typically feature an amortization period of 30 years. In addition, our multi-family loans may contain an initial interest-only period which typically does not exceed two years; however, these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis. 

Accordingly, while our multi-family lending niche has not been immune to downturns in the credit cycle, the limited number of losses we have recorded, even in adverse credit cycles, suggests that the multi-family loans we produce involve less credit risk than certain other types of loans. In general, buildings that are subject to rent regulation have tended to be stable, with occupancy levels remaining more or less constant over time. Because the rents are typically below market and the buildings securing our loans are generally maintained in good condition, they have been more likely to retain their tenants in adverse economic times. In addition, we exclude any short-term property tax exemptions and abatement benefits the property owners receive when we underwrite our multi-family loans. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

At December 31, 2019, CRE loans represented $7.1 billion, or 16.9%, of total loans held for investment, reflecting a year-over-year increase of $83.1 million or 1.2% compared to December 31, 2018. The average CRE loan had a principal balance of $6.6 million at the end of this December, as compared to $6.1 million at the prior year-end.

In addition, the portfolio had an expected weighted average life of 2.3 years and 2.7 years at the corresponding dates.

CRE loans represented $1.2 billion, or 11.6%, of the loans we originated in 2019, as compared to $966.7 million, or 9.6%, in the prior year. 

The CRE loans we produce are secured by income-producing properties such as office buildings, retail centers, mixed-use 

buildings, and multi-tenanted light industrial properties. At December 31, 2019, 85.7% of our CRE loans were secured by properties in the metro New York City area, while properties in other parts of New York State accounted for 2.3% of the properties securing our CRE credits, while all other states accounted for 12.0%, combined.

The terms of our CRE loans are similar to the terms of our multi-family credits. While a small percentage of our CRE loans feature ten-year

fixed-rate terms, they primarily feature a fixed rate of interest for the first five or seven years of the loan that is generally based on intermediate-term interest rates plus a spread. During years six through ten or eight through twelve, the loan resets to an annually adjustable rate that is tied to the prime rate of interest, plus a spread .

Alternately, the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the five-year fixed advance rate of the FHLB-NY

plus a spread. The fixed-rate option also requires the payment of an amount equal to one percentage point of the then-outstanding loan balance. In either case, the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five- or seven-year term.

Prepayment penalties apply to our CRE loans, as they do our multi-family credits. Depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment, the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the then-current loan balance. If a loan extends past the fifth or seventh year and the borrower selects the fixed rate option, the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten or eight through twelve. Our CRE loans tend to refinance within two to three years of origination, as reflected in the expected weighted average life of the CRE portfolio noted above. 

The repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties. To minimize our credit risk, we originate CRE loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards, and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the property&#8217;s current income stream and DSCR. The approval of a loan also depends on the borrower&#8217;s credit history, profitability, and expertise in property management, and generally requires a minimum DSCR of 130% and a maximum LTV of 65%. In addition, the origination of CRE loans typically requires a security interest in the fixtures, equipment, and other personal property of the borrower and/or an assignment of the rents and/or leases. In addition, our CRE loans may contain an interest-only period which typically does not exceed three years; however, these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis. 

C&#38;I Loans 

Our C&#38;I loans are divided into two categories: Specialty Finance Loans and Leases and other C&#38;I loans, as further described below. 

Specialty Finance Loans and Leases 

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, specialty finance loans and leases represented $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of total loans held for investment. 

We produce our specialty finance loans and leases through a subsidiary that is staffed by a group of industry veterans with expertise in originating and underwriting senior securitized debt and equipment loans and leases. The subsidiary participates in syndicated loans that are brought to them, and equipment loans and leases that are assigned to them, by a select group of nationally recognized sources, and are generally made to large corporate obligors, many of which are publicly traded, carry investment grade or near-investment grade ratings, and participate in stable industries nationwide. 

The specialty finance loans and leases we fund fall into three categories: asset-based lending, dealer floor-plan lending, and equipment loan and lease financing. Each of these credits is secured with a perfected first security interest in, or outright ownership of, the underlying collateral, and structured as senior debt or as a non-cancelable

lease. Asset-based and dealer floor-plan loans are priced at floating rates predominately tied to LIBOR, while our equipment financing credits are priced at fixed rates at a spread over Treasuries.

Since launching our specialty finance business in the third quarter of 2013, no losses have been recorded on any of the loans or leases in this portfolio. 

Other C&#38;I Loans 

In the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, other C&#38;I loans declined $49.8 million to $420.1 million, and represented $391.7 million of the held-for-investment

loans we produced. Included in the balance at year-end

2019 were taxi medallion-related loans of $55.0 million.

In contrast to the loans produced by our specialty finance subsidiary, the other C&#38;I loans we produce are primarily made to small and mid-size

businesses in the five boroughs of New York City and on Long Island. Such loans are tailored to meet the specific needs of our borrowers, and include term loans, demand loans, revolving lines of credit, and, to a much lesser extent, loans that are partly guaranteed by the Small Business Administration.

A broad range of other C&#38;I loans, both collateralized and unsecured, are made available to businesses for working capital (including inventory and accounts receivable), business expansion, the purchase of machinery and equipment, and other general corporate needs. In determining the term and structure of other C&#38;I loans, several factors are considered, including the purpose, the collateral, and the anticipated sources of repayment. Other C&#38;I loans are typically secured by business assets and personal guarantees of the borrower, and include financial covenants to monitor the borrower&#8217;s financial stability. 

The interest rates on our other C&#38;I loans can be fixed or floating, with floating-rate loans being tied to prime or some other market index, plus an applicable spread. Our floating-rate loans may or may not feature a floor rate of interest. The decision to require a floor on other C&#38;I loans depends on the level of competition we face for such loans from other institutions, the direction of market interest rates, and the profitability of our relationship with the borrower. 

Acquisition, Development, and Construction Loans 

At December 31, 2019, ADC loans represented $200.6 million, or 0.5%, of total loans held for investment, as compared to $407.9 million, or 1.0%, at the prior year-end.

Originations of ADC loans totaled $91.4 million in 2019, up $34.7 million from the year-earlier amount.

At December 31, 2019, 4.2% of the loans in our ADC portfolio were for land acquisition and development; the remaining 95.8% consisted of loans that were provided for the construction of commercial properties and owner-occupied homes. Loan terms vary based upon the scope of the construction, and generally range from 18 months to two years. They also feature a floating rate of interest tied to prime, with a floor. At December 31, 2019, 70.5% of our ADC loans were for properties in New York City. 

Because ADC loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk, especially during a downturn in the credit cycle, borrowers are required to provide a guarantee of repayment and completion. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we did not recover any losses against guarantees. The risk of loss on an ADC loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial appraisal of the property&#8217;s value upon completion of construction; the developer&#8217;s experience; the estimated cost of construction, including interest; and the estimated time to complete and/or sell or lease such property. 

When applicable, as a condition to closing an ADC loan, it is our practice to require that properties meet pre-sale

or pre-lease 

requirements prior to funding.

One-to-Four

Family Loans 

At December 31, 2019, one-to-four

family loans represented $380.4 million, or 0.9%, of total loans held for investment, as compared to $446.1 million, or 1.1%, at the prior year-end.

These loan balances include certain mixed-use CRE loans with less than five residential units being classified as one-to-four

family loans. Other than these types of loans, we do not currently expect to originate traditional one-to-four

family loans.

Other Loans 

At December 31, 2019, other loans totaled $8.1 million and consisted primarily of consumer loans, most of which were overdraft loans and loans to non-profit

organizations. We currently do not offer home equity loans or lines of credit.

Lending Authority 

The loans we originate for investment are subject to federal and state laws and regulations, and are underwritten in accordance with loan underwriting policies approved by the Management Credit Committee, the Commercial Credit Committee and the Mortgage and Real Estate and Credit Committees of the Board, and the Board of Directors of the Bank. 

All multifamily, CRE, ADC, and Specialty Finance loans regardless of amount and C&#38;I loans in excess of $3.0 million are required to be presented to the Management Credit Committee for approval. Multifamily, CRE and C&#38;I loans in excess of $5.0 million and Specialty Finance in excess of $15.0 million are also required to be presented to the Commercial Credit Committee and the Mortgage and Real Estate Committee of the Board, as applicable. All C&#38;I loans less than or equal to $3.0 million are approved by the joint authority of lending officers.

All mortgage loans in excess of $50.0 million, Specialty Finance loans in excess of $15.0 million and all other C&#38;I loans in excess of $5.0 million require approval by the Mortgage and Real Estate Committee or the Credit Committee of the Board, as applicable. In addition, all loans of $20.0 million or more originated by the Bank continue to be reported to the Board of Directors.

The various Committee have authority to direct changes in lending practices as they deem necessary or appropriate in order to address individual or aggregate risks and credit exposures in accordance with the Bank&#8217;s strategic objectives and risk appetites.

In 2019, 146 loans greater than $10.0 million were originated by the Bank, with an aggregate loan balance of $4.1 billion at origination. In 2018, by comparison, 192 loans greater than $10.0 million were originated, with an aggregate loan balance at origination of $4.5 billion. 

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the largest mortgage loan in our portfolio was a $246.0 million multi-family loan originated by the Bank on February 8, 2018, which is collateralized by six properties located in Brooklyn, New York. As of the date of this report, the loan has been current since origination.

&#160;

Outstanding Loan Commitments 

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had outstanding loan commitments of $2.0 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. We also had commitments to issue letters of credit totaling $509.9 million and $508.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in &#8220;Fee income&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 

The letters of credit we issue consist of performance stand-by,

financial stand-by,

and commercial letters of credit. Financial stand-by

letters of credit primarily are issued for the benefit of other financial institutions, municipalities, or landlords on behalf of certain of our current borrowers, and obligate us to guarantee payment of a specified financial obligation. Performance stand-by

letters of credit are primarily issued for the benefit of local municipalities on behalf of certain of our borrowers. Performance letters of credit obligate us to make payments in the event that a specified third party fails to perform under non-financial

contractual obligations. Commercial letters of credit act as a means of ensuring payment to a seller upon shipment of goods to a buyer. Although commercial letters of credit are used to effect payment for domestic transactions, the majority are used to settle payments in international trade. Typically, such letters of credit require the presentation of documents that describe the commercial transaction, and provide evidence of shipment and the transfer of title.

For more information about our outstanding loan commitments and commitments to issue letters of credit at the end of this December, see the discussion of &#8220;Liquidity&#8221; later in this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. 

Asset Quality 

Loans Held for Investment and Repossessed Assets 

Total NPAs were $73.5 million or 0.14% of total assets at December 31, 2019, up 30.6% or $17.2 million compared to $56.3 million or 0.11% of total assets at December 31, 2018. Total non-accrual

mortgage loans rose $13.1 million to $22.0 million, largely due to one CRE credit that went non-performing

during the fourth quarter of 2019. Other non-accrual

loans, consisting mainly of taxi medallion-related loans, rose $2.7 million to $39.3 million compared to $36.6 million at December 31, 2018. Included in these amounts were non-accrual

taxi medallion-related loans of $30.4 million and $35.5 million, respectively.

Repossessed assets totaled $12.3 million, up $1.5 million or 13.7% compared to the balance at December 31, 2018. As is the case with other non-accrual

loans, the majority of the Company&#8217;s repossessed assets consist of taxi medallions. Taxi medallions represented $10.3 million of total repossessed assets at December 31, 2019 compared to $8.2 million at December 31, 2018.

A loan generally is classified as a &#8220;non-accrual&#8221;

loan when it is 90 days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because we no longer expect to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is placed on non-accrual

status, we cease the accrual of interest owed, and previously accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, all of our non-performing

loans were non-accrual

loans. A loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is current and we have reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible.

We monitor non-accrual

loans both within and beyond our primary lending area in the same manner. Monitoring loans generally involves inspecting and re-appraising

the collateral properties; holding discussions with the principals and managing agents of the borrowing entities and/or retained legal counsel, as applicable; requesting financial, operating, and rent roll information; confirming that hazard insurance is in place or force-placing such insurance; monitoring tax payment status and advancing funds as needed; and appointing a receiver, whenever possible, to collect rents, manage the operations, provide information, and maintain the collateral properties.

It is our policy to order updated appraisals for all non-performing

loans, irrespective of loan type, that are collateralized by multi-family buildings, CRE properties, or land, in the event that such a loan is 90 days or more past due, and if the most recent appraisal on file for the property is more than one year old. Appraisals are ordered annually until such time as the loan becomes performing and is returned to accrual status. It is not our policy to obtain updated appraisals for performing loans. However, appraisals may be ordered for performing loans when a borrower requests an increase in the loan amount, a modification in loan terms, or an extension of a maturing loan. We do not analyze current LTVs on a portfolio-wide basis.

Non-performing

loans are reviewed regularly by management and discussed on a monthly basis with the Mortgage Committee, the Credit Committee, and the Board of Directors of the Bank, as applicable. In accordance with our charge-off

policy, collateral-dependent non-performing

loans are written down to their current appraised values, less certain transaction costs. Workout specialists from our Loan Workout Unit actively pursue borrowers who are delinquent in repaying their loans in an effort to collect payment. In addition, outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to institute such action with regard to such borrowers.

Properties and other assets that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets, and are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, less the estimated cost of selling the property. Subsequent declines in the fair value of the assets are charged to earnings and are included in non-interest

expense. It is our policy to require an appraisal and an environmental assessment of properties classified as OREO before foreclosure, and to re-appraise

the properties on an as-needed

basis, and not less than annually, until they are sold. We dispose of such properties as quickly and prudently as possible, given current market conditions and the property&#8217;s condition. 

To mitigate the potential for credit losses, we underwrite our loans in accordance with credit standards that we consider to be prudent. In the case of multi-family and CRE loans, we look first at the consistency of the cash flows being generated by the property to determine its economic value using the &#8220;income approach,&#8221; and then at the market value of the property that collateralizes the loan. The amount of the loan is then based on the lower of the two values, with the economic value more typically used. 

The condition of the collateral property is another critical factor. Multi-family buildings and CRE properties are inspected from rooftop to basement as a prerequisite to approval, with a member of the Mortgage or Credit Committee participating in inspections on multi-family loans to be originated in excess of $7.5 million, and a member of the Mortgage or Credit Committee participating in inspections on CRE loans to be originated in excess of $4.0 million. Furthermore, independent appraisers, whose appraisals are carefully reviewed by our experienced in-house

appraisal officers and staff, perform appraisals on collateral properties. In many cases, a second independent appraisal review is performed.

In addition, we work with a select group of mortgage brokers who are familiar with our credit standards and whose track record with our lending officers is typically greater than ten years. Furthermore, in New York City, where the majority of the buildings securing our multi-family loans are located, the rents that tenants may be charged on certain apartments are typically restricted under certain rent-control or rent-stabilization laws. As a result, the rents that tenants pay for such apartments are generally lower than current market rents. Buildings with a preponderance of such rent-regulated apartments are less likely to experience vacancies in times of economic adversity. 

Reflecting the strength of the underlying collateral for these loans and the collateral structure, a relatively small percentage of our non-performing

multi-family loans have resulted in losses over time.

To further manage our credit risk, our lending policies limit the amount of credit granted to any one borrower, and typically require minimum DSCRs of 120% for multi-family loans and 130% for CRE loans. Although we typically lend up to 75% of the appraised value on multi-family buildings and up to 65% on commercial properties, the average LTVs of such credits at origination were below those amounts at December 31, 2019. Exceptions to these LTV limitations are minimal and are reviewed on a case-by-case

basis.

The repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties. To minimize our credit risk, we originate CRE loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards, and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the property&#8217;s current income stream and DSCR. The approval of a CRE loan also depends on the borrower&#8217;s credit history, profitability, and expertise in property management. Given that our CRE loans are underwritten in accordance with underwriting standards that are similar to those applicable to our multi-family credits, the percentage of our non-performing

CRE loans that have resulted in losses has been comparatively small over time.

Multi-family and CRE loans are generally originated at conservative LTVs and DSCRs, as previously stated. Low LTVs provide a greater likelihood of full recovery and reduce the possibility of incurring a severe loss on a credit; in many cases, they reduce the likelihood of the borrower &#8220;walking away&#8221; from the property. Although borrowers may default on loan payments, they have a greater incentive to protect their equity in the collateral property and to return their loans to performing status. Furthermore, in the case of multi-family loans, the cash flows generated by the properties are generally below-market and have significant value. 

With regard to ADC loans, we typically lend up to 75% of the estimated as-completed

market value of multi-family and residential tract projects; however, in the case of home construction loans to individuals, the limit is 80%. With respect to commercial construction loans, we typically lend up to 65% of the estimated as-completed

market value of the property. Credit risk is also managed through the loan disbursement process. Loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses, and as warranted by inspection reports provided to us by our own lending officers and/or consulting engineers. 

To minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing, each of our credits is secured with a perfected first security interest or outright ownership in the underlying collateral, and structured as senior debt or as a non-cancellable

lease. To further minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing, we re-underwrite

each transaction. In addition, we retain outside counsel to conduct a further review of the underlying documentation.

Other C&#38;I loans are typically underwritten on the basis of the cash flows produced by the borrower&#8217;s business, and are generally collateralized by various business assets, including, but not limited to, inventory, equipment, and accounts receivable. As a result, the capacity of the borrower to repay is substantially dependent on the degree to which the business is successful. Furthermore, the collateral underlying the loan may depreciate over time, may not be conducive to appraisal, and may fluctuate in value, based upon the operating results of the business. Accordingly, personal guarantees are also a normal requirement for other C&#38;I loans. 

In addition, at December 31, 2019, one-to-four

family loans, ADC loans, and other loans represented 0.9%, 0.5%, and 7.2%, of total loans held for investment, as compared to 1.1%, 1.0%, and 6.0%, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Furthermore, while 1.3% of our other loans were non-performing

at December 31, 2019, 0.45% of our one-to-four

family loans were non-performing

at that date. There were no non-performing

ADC loans at December 31, 2019.

The procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories, with late charges assessed, and notices mailed to the borrower, at specified dates. We attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment. When contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property, we attempt to obtain full payment, and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action. Delinquencies are addressed by our Loan Workout Unit and every effort is made to collect rather than initiate foreclosure proceedings.

loans 30 to 89 days past due by loan type and the changes in the respective balances from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019:

taxi medallion-related loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

##TABLE_END &#160;

Fair values for all multi-family buildings, CRE properties, and land are determined based on the appraised value. If an appraisal is more than one year old and the loan is classified as either non-performing

or as an accruing TDR, then an updated appraisal is required to determine fair value. Estimated disposition costs are deducted from the fair value of the property to determine estimated net realizable value. In the instance of an outdated appraisal on an impaired loan, we adjust the original appraisal by using a third-party index value to determine the extent of impairment until an updated appraisal is received. 

While we strive to originate loans that will perform fully, adverse economic and market conditions, among other factors, can negatively impact a borrower&#8217;s ability to repay. Historically, our level of charge-offs has been relatively low in downward credit cycles, even when the volume of non-performing

loans has increased. In 2019, we recorded net charge-offs of $19.3 million, as compared to net charge-offs of $16.5 million in the prior year. Taxi medallion-related net charge-offs accounted for $10.2 million of this year&#8217;s amount and $12.8 million of last year&#8217;s amount.

Partially reflecting the net charge-offs noted above, and the provision of $7.1 million for the allowance for loan losses, the allowance for losses on loans decreased $12.2 million, equaling $147.6 million at the end of this December from $159.8 million at December 31, 2018. Reflecting the decrease in non-performing

loans cited earlier in this discussion, the allowance for losses on loans represented 241.07% of non-performing

loans at December 31, 2019, as compared to 351.21% at the prior year-end. 

Based upon all relevant and available information at the end of this December, management believes that the allowance for losses on loans was appropriate at that date. 

The following table presents information about our five largest non-performing

loans at December 31, 2019.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

In an effort to proactively manage delinquent loans, we have selectively extended such concessions as rate reductions and extensions of maturity dates, as well as forbearance agreements, to certain borrowers who have experienced financial difficulty. In accordance with GAAP, we are required to account for such loan modifications or restructurings as TDRs. 

The eligibility of a borrower for work-out

concessions of any nature depends upon the facts and circumstances of each transaction, which may change from period to period, and involve management&#8217;s judgment regarding the likelihood that the concession will result in the maximum recovery for the Company.

Loans modified as TDRs are placed on non-accrual

status until we determine that future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured. This generally requires that the borrower demonstrate performance according to the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months.

At December 31, 2019, loans modified as TDRs totaled $40.5 million, including accruing loans of $1.3 million and non-accrual 

loans of $39.2 million. At the prior year-end,

loans modified as TDRs totaled $34.9 million, including accruing loans of $9.2 million and non-accrual

loans of $25.7 million.

Loans on which concessions were made with respect to rate reductions and/or extensions of maturity dates totaled $32.7 million and $34.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019 and 2018; loans in connection with which forbearance agreements were reached amounted to $7.8 million and $37,000 at the respective dates. 

Multi-family and CRE loans accounted for $3.6 million and zero dollars of TDRs at the end of this December, as compared to $4.2 million and zero, respectively, at the prior year-end.

Based on the number of loans performing in accordance with their revised terms, our success rate for restructured multi-family loans was 100%; for ADC loans it was 100%; and for one-to-four

loans it was 33% at the end of this December; our success rate for other loans was 88%, at that date.

On a limited basis, we may provide additional credit to a borrower after the loan has been placed on non-accrual

status or modified as a TDR if, in management&#8217;s judgment, the value of the property after the additional loan funding is greater than the initial value of the property plus the additional loan funding amount. In 2019, no such additional credit was provided. Furthermore, the terms of our restructured loans typically would not restrict us from cancelling outstanding commitments for other credit facilities to a borrower in the event of non-payment

of a restructured loan.

For additional information about our TDRs at December 31, 2019 and 2018, see the discussion of &#8220;Asset Quality&#8221; in Note 5, &#8220;Loans and Leases&#8221; in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

Except for the non-accrual

loans and TDRs disclosed in this filing, we did not have any potential problem loans at December 31, 2019 that would have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of a borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms and that would have resulted in such disclosure if that were the case.

Each of the preceding allocations was based upon an estimate of various factors, as discussed in &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; earlier in this report, and a different allocation methodology may be deemed to be more appropriate in the future. In addition, it should be noted that the portion of the allowance for losses on non-covered

loans allocated to each non-covered

loan category does not represent the total amount available to absorb losses that may occur within that category, since the total loan loss allowance is available for the entire non-covered

loan portfolio.

Total securities were $5.9 billion, or 11.0%, of total assets at the end of this December, as compared to $5.6 billion, or 10.9%, of total assets at December 31, 2018. During the second quarter of 2017, we reclassified our entire securities portfolio as &#8220;Available-for-Sale&#8221;.

Accordingly, at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had no securities designated as &#8220;Held-to-Maturity&#8221;.

During 2019, the Company purchased $93.5 million of CRA&#8212;qualified loans. Subsequently, the loans were securitized and transferred to the securities portfolio. At December 31, 2019, 35% of the securities portfolio was tied to floating rates, 34% of which is currently at floating rates, mainly one and three month LIBOR and prime.

At December 31, 2019, available-for-sale

securities were $5.9 billion and had an estimated weighted average life of 4.4 years. Included in the year-end

amount were mortgage-related securities of $3.4 billion and other debt securities of $2.5 billion.

At the prior year-end,

available-for-sale

securities were $5.6 billion, and had an estimated weighted average life of 6.2 years. Mortgage-related securities accounted for $3.0 billion of the year-end

balance, with other debt securities accounting for the remaining $2.6 billion.

The investment policies of the Company and the Bank are established by the Board of Directors and implemented by the ALCO. ALCO meets monthly or on an as-needed

basis to review the portfolios and specific capital market transactions. In addition, the securities portfolios and investment activities are reviewed monthly by the Board of Directors. Furthermore, the policy governing the investment portfolio activities is reviewed at least annually by the ALCO and ratified by the Board of Directors.

Our general investment strategy is to purchase liquid investments with various maturities to ensure that our overall interest rate risk position stays within the required limits of our investment policies. We generally limit our investments to GSE obligations and U.S. Treasury obligations. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, GSE obligations and U.S. Treasury obligations together represented 82.6% and 83.5% of total securities, respectively. The remainder of the portfolio at those dates was comprised of corporate bonds, capital trust notes, asset-backed securities, and municipal obligations. 

Federal Home Loan Bank Stock 

As members of the FHLB-NY,

the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of its capital stock. At December 31, 2019, the Bank held FHLB-NY

stock in the amount of $647.6 million. At December 31, 2018, the Bank held FHLB-NY

stock in the amount of $644.6 million. Dividends from the FHLB-NY

to the Bank totaled $39.5 million and $40.8 million, respectively, in 2019 and 2018. 

Bank-Owned Life Insurance 

BOLI is recorded at the total cash surrender value of the policies in the Consolidated Statements of Condition, and the income generated by the increase in the cash surrender value of the policies is recorded in &#8220;Non-interest

income&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Reflecting an increase in the cash surrender value of the underlying policies and the purchase of $150.0 million of additional BOLI, our investment in BOLI rose $167.4 million year-over-year to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019.

Goodwill 

We record goodwill in our consolidated statements of condition in connection with certain of our business combinations. Goodwill, which is tested at least annually for impairment, refers to the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of an acquired company&#8217;s assets, net of the liabilities assumed. Goodwill totaled $2.4 billion at both December 31, 2019 and 2018. 

For more information about the Company&#8217;s goodwill, see the discussion of &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; earlier in this report. 

Sources of Funds 

The Parent Company has four primary funding sources for the payment of dividends, share repurchases, and other corporate uses: dividends paid to the Parent Company by the Bank; capital raised through the issuance of securities; funding raised through the issuance of debt instruments; and repayments of, and income from, investment securities. 

On a consolidated basis, our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources: retail, institutional, and brokered deposits; borrowed funds, primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings; cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans; and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities. 

In 2019, loan repayments and sales generated cash flows of $8.9 billion, as compared to $8.3 billion in 2018. Cash flows from repayments accounted for $8.8 billion and $8.1 billion of the respective totals and cash flows from sales accounted for $115.3 million and $195.6 million, of the respective totals. 

In 2019, cash flows from the repayment and sale of securities respectively totaled $2.0 billion and $361.3 million, while the purchase of securities amounted to $2.5 billion for the year. By comparison, cash flows from the repayment and sale of securities totaled $817.8 million and $278.5 million, respectively, in 2018, and were offset by the purchase of securities totaling $3.3 billion. 

In 2019, the cash flows from loans and securities were primarily deployed into the production of multi-family loans held for investment, as well as held-for-investment

CRE loans and specialty finance loans and leases.

Deposits 

Total deposits increased $892.7 million or 2.9% on a year-over-year basis to $31.7 billion. Deposit growth was driven by CDs and to a lesser extent by growth in savings accounts and non-interest

bearing accounts. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, CDs rose $2.0 billion or 16.6% to $14.2 billion, while savings accounts increased $136.7 million or 2.9% to $4.8 billion and non-interest

bearing deposits increased over the same timeframe by $35.3 million or 1.5% to $2.4 billion. This was consistent with our strategy to increase the level of retail CDs.

While the vast majority of our deposits are retail in nature (i.e., they are deposits we have gathered through our branches or through business combinations), institutional deposits and municipal deposits are also part of our deposit mix. Retail deposits rose $319.7 million year-over-year to $24.4 billion, while institutional deposits declined $655.6 million to $1.1 billion at year-end. 

Municipal deposits represented $990.2 million of total deposits at the end of this December, a $28.3 million increase from the balance at December 31, 2018.

Depending on their availability and pricing relative to other funding sources, we also include brokered deposits in our deposit mix. Brokered deposits accounted for $5.2 billion of our deposits at the end of this December, compared to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2018. Brokered money market accounts represented $1.5 billion of total brokered deposits at December 31, 2019 and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2018; brokered interest-bearing checking accounts represented $1.2 billion and $786.1 million, respectively, at the corresponding dates. At December 31, 2019, we had $2.5 billion of brokered CDs, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2018. 

Borrowed Funds 

The majority of our borrowed funds are wholesale borrowings and consist of FHLB-NY

advances, repurchase agreements, and federal funds purchased, and, to a lesser extent, junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes. At December 31, 2019, total borrowed funds increased $349.7 million or 2.5% to $14.6 billion compared to the balance at December 31, 2018. The bulk of the year-over-year increase was driven by a $349.0 million or 2.6% increase in the balance of wholesale borrowings.

Wholesale Borrowings 

Wholesale borrowings totaled $13.9 billion and $13.6 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, representing 25.9% and 26.1% of total assets at the respective dates. FHLB-NY

advances accounted for $13.1 billion of the year-end

2019 balance, as compared to $13.1 billion at the prior year-end.

Pursuant to blanket collateral agreements with the Bank, our FHLB-NY

advances and overnight advances are secured by pledges of certain eligible collateral in the form of loans and securities. (For more information regarding our FHLB-NY

advances, see the discussion that appears earlier in this report regarding our membership and our ownership of stock in the FHLB-NY.)

At December 31, 2019, $8.3 billion of our wholesale borrowings had callable features compared to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2018,

Also included in wholesale borrowings were repurchase agreements of $800.0 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $500.0 million at December 31, 2018. Repurchase agreements are contracts for the sale of securities owned or borrowed by the Bank with an agreement to repurchase those securities at agreed-upon prices and dates. 

Our repurchase agreements are primarily collateralized by GSE obligations, and may be entered into with the FHLB-NY

or certain brokerage firms. The brokerage firms we utilize are subject to an ongoing internal financial review to ensure that we borrow funds only from those dealers whose financial strength will minimize the risk of loss due to default. In addition, a master repurchase agreement must be executed and on file for each of the brokerage firms we use.

We had no federal funds purchased at both December 31, 2019 and 2018. 

Junior Subordinated Debentures 

Junior subordinated debentures totaled $359.9 million at December 31, 2019, slightly higher than the balance at the prior year-end

reflecting discount accretion.

Subordinated Notes 

At December 31, 2019, the balance of subordinated notes was $295.1 million, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2018. 

See Note 9, &#8220;Borrowed Funds,&#8221; in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for a further discussion of our wholesale borrowings and our junior subordinated debentures. 

Liquidity, Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance

Sheet Commitments, and Capital Position 

Liquidity 

We manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations, and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand. 

We monitor our liquidity daily to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet our financial obligations. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $741.9 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019 and 2018. As in the past, our loan and securities portfolios provided meaningful liquidity in 2019, with cash flows from the repayment and sale of loans totaling $8.9 billion and cash flows from the repayment and sale of securities totaling $2.3 billion. 

Additional liquidity stems from deposits and from our use of wholesale funding sources, including brokered deposits and wholesale borrowings. In addition, we have access to the Bank&#8217;s approved lines of credit with various counterparties, including the FHLB-NY.

The availability of these wholesale funding sources is generally based on the amount of mortgage loan collateral available under a blanket lien we have pledged to the respective institutions and, to a lesser extent, the amount of available securities that may be pledged to collateralize our borrowings. At December 31, 2019, our available borrowing capacity with the FHLB-NY

was $7.9 billion. In addition, the Bank had available-for-sale

securities of $5.9 billion, of which, $4.5 billion is unpledged.

Furthermore, the Bank has agreements with the FRB-NY

that enable it to access the discount window as a further means of enhancing their liquidity. In connection with these agreements, the Bank has pledged certain loans and securities to collateralize any funds they may borrow. At December 31, 2019, the maximum amount the Bank could borrow from the FRB-NY

was $1.1 billion. There were no borrowings against either line of credit at December 31, 2019.

Our primary investing activity is loan production, and the volume of loans we originated for investment totaled $10.6 billion in 2019. During this time, the net cash used in investing activities totaled $2.1 billion; the net cash provided by our operating activities totaled $509.8 million. Our financing activities provided net cash of $816.1 million. 

CDs due to mature or reprice in one year or less from December 31, 2019 totaled $13.3 billion, representing 94% of total CDs at that date. Our ability to attract and retain retail deposits, including CDs, depends on numerous factors, including, among others, the convenience of our branches and our other banking channels; our customers&#8217; satisfaction with the service they receive; the rates of interest we offer; the types of products we feature; and the attractiveness of their terms. 

Our decision to compete for deposits also depends on numerous factors, including, among others, our access to deposits through acquisitions, the availability of lower-cost funding sources, the impact of competition on pricing, and the need to fund our loan demand. 

The Parent Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases, the Parent Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to our shareholders. As a Delaware corporation, the Parent Company is able to pay dividends either from surplus or, in case there is no surplus, from net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. 

The Parent Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends may also depend, in part, upon dividends it receives from the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends and other capital distributions to the Parent Company is generally limited by New York State Banking Law and regulations, and by certain regulations of the FDIC. In addition, the Superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services (the &#8220;Superintendent&#8221;), the FDIC, and the FRB, for reasons of safety and soundness, may prohibit the payment of dividends that are otherwise permissible by regulations. 

Under New York State Banking Law, a New York State-chartered stock-form savings bank or commercial bank may declare and pay dividends out of its net profits, unless there is an impairment of capital. However, the approval of the Superintendent is required if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of a bank&#8217;s net profits for that year, combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years. In 2019, the Bank paid dividends totaling $380.0 million to the Parent Company, leaving $305.7 million that it could dividend to the Parent Company without regulatory approval at year-end.

Additional sources of liquidity available to the Parent Company at December 31, 2019 included $183.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. If the Bank was to apply to the Superintendent for approval to make a dividend or capital distribution in excess of the dividend amounts permitted under the regulations, there can be no assurance that such application would be approved.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance

Sheet Commitments 

In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of contractual obligations in order to manage our assets and liabilities, fund loan growth, operate our branch network, and address our capital needs. 

For example, we offer CDs with contractual terms to our customers, and borrow funds under contract from the FHLB-NY

and various brokerage firms. These contractual obligations are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Condition under &#8220;Deposits&#8221; and &#8220;Borrowed funds,&#8221; respectively. At December 31, 2019, we had CDs of $14.2 billion and long-term debt (defined as borrowed funds with an original maturity in excess of one year) of $13.5 billion.

We also are obligated under certain non-cancelable

operating leases on the buildings and land we use in operating our branch network and in performing our back-office responsibilities. These obligations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Condition and totaled $384.2 million at December 31, 2019.

Contractual Obligations 

The following table sets forth the maturity profile of the aforementioned contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:

At December 31, 2019, we also had commitments to extend credit in the form of mortgage and other loan originations, as well as commercial, performance stand-by,

and financial stand-by

letters of credit, totaling $2.5 billion. These off-balance

sheet commitments consist of agreements to extend credit, as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract under which the loan is made. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee.

Based upon our current liquidity position, we expect that our funding will be sufficient to fulfill these obligations and commitments when they are due. 

At December 31, 2019, we had no commitments to purchase securities. 

Capital Position 

Total stockholders&#8217; equity rose $56.5 million, or 0.8%, year-over-year to $6.7 billion; common stockholders&#8217; equity represented 11.57% of total assets and a book value per common share of $13.29 at December 31, 2019. At the prior year-end,

total stockholders&#8217; equity totaled $6.7 billion, and common stockholders&#8217; equity represented 11.85% of total assets and a book value per common share of $12.99.

Tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity increased $66.2 million year-over-year to $3.8 billion. The year-end

2019 balance represented 7.39% of tangible common assets and a tangible common book value per common share of $8.09. At the prior year-end, 

tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity totaled $3.7 billion, representing 7.51% of tangible common assets and a tangible common book value per common share of $7.85.

We calculate tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity by subtracting the amount of goodwill and preferred stock recorded at the end of a period from the amount of stockholders&#8217; equity recorded at the same date. Goodwill totaled $2.4 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018 while preferred stock was $502.8 million at the end of 2019 and 2018. (See the discussion and reconciliations of stockholders&#8217; equity and tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity, total assets and tangible assets, and the related financial measures that appear on the last page of this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations.) 

Stockholders&#8217; equity and tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity both include AOCL, which is comprised of the net unrealized gain or loss on available-for-sale

securities; the net unrealized loss on the non-credit

portion of OTTI securities; the net unrealized gain on cash flow hedges; and the Company&#8217;s pension and post-retirement obligations at the end of a period. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, AOCL totaled $32.8 million and $87.7 million, respectively. The decrease in AOCL was largely the net effect of an $11.9 million decrease in net pension and post-retirement obligations to $59.1 million and the $42.0 million difference between the net unrealized loss on securities available for sale recorded at the end of this December and the net unrealized gain on securities available for sale recorded at December 31, 2018. 

As reflected in the following table, our capital measures continued to exceed the minimum federal requirements for a bank holding company at December 31, 2019 and 2018:

At December 31, 2019, the capital ratios for the Company and the Bank continued to exceed the levels required for classification as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; institutions, as defined under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, and as further discussed in Note 19, &#8220;Capital,&#8221; in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is our primary source of income. Its level is a function of the average balance of our interest-earning assets, the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by various external factors, including the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FOMC, and market interest rates. 

The cost of our deposits and borrowed funds is largely based on short-term rates of interest, the level of which is partially impacted by the actions of the FOMC. The FOMC reduces, maintains, or increases the target federal funds rate (the rate at which banks borrow funds overnight from one another) as it deems necessary. In 2018, the FOMC increased the target federal funds rate four times for a total of 100 basis points, to a target range of 2.25% to 2.50%. 

While the target federal funds rate generally impacts the cost of our short-term borrowings and deposits, the yields on our held-for-investment

loans and other interest-earning assets are typically impacted by intermediate-term market interest rates. In 2019, the five-year CMT ranged from a low of 1.32% to a high of 2.62% with an average rate of 1.95% for the year. In 2018, the five-year CMT ranged from a low of 2.25% to a high of 3.09% with an average rate of 2.75% for the year.

Another factor that impacts the yields on our interest-earning assets&#8212;and our net interest income&#8212;is the income generated by our multi-family and CRE loans and securities when they prepay. Since prepayment income is recorded as interest income, an increase or decrease in its level will also be reflected in the average yields (as applicable) on our loans, securities, and interest-earning assets, and therefore in our net interest income, our net interest rate spread, and our net interest margin. 

It should be noted that the level of prepayment income on loans recorded in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay during that time. Such activity is largely dependent on such external factors as current market conditions, including real estate values, and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates. In addition, while a decline in market interest rates may trigger an increase in refinancing and, therefore, prepayment income, so too may an increase in market interest rates. It is not unusual for borrowers to lock in lower interest rates when they expect, or see, that market interest rates are rising rather than risk refinancing later at a still higher interest rate. 

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, net interest income declined $73.6 million or 7% to $957.4 million. Total interest income rose $115.5 million or 6.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, while total interest expense rose $189.1 million or 29% for the same time period. 

Year-Over-Year Comparison 

The following factors contributed to the year-over-year decline in net interest income: 

##TABLE_START &#160; &#8226; Interest income increased $115.5 million or 6.8% to $1.8 billion on a year-over-year basis due to an $85.1 million or 5.8% increase in interest income from loans and a $51.5 million or 28.0% increase in interest income from securities. ##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#8226; The increase in interest income from loans was the result of a higher level of average loan balances in 2019 compared to 2018, as well as, a higher yield on the loans. Average loans increased $1.3 billion to $40.4 billion, up 3.2% compared to 2018. At the same time, the average yield on the loan portfolio rose ten basis points to 3.85%, year-over-year. In addition, prepayment income contributed $48.9 million and 11 basis points to interest income and the average yield from loans, respectively, compared to $44.9 million and ten basis points in the prior year. ##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#8226; The year-over-year improvement in interest income from securities was driven by a $1.5 billion increase in the average balance of securities partially offset by a ten basis point decline in the average yield to 3.72%. Prepayment income added $5.3 million and one basis point to the interest income and average yield from securities, respectively, relatively unchanged from 2018. ##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#8226; The average balance of interest-earning assets increased $1.6 billion or 3.4% to $47.5 billion and the average yield rose 12 basis points to 3.80%. ##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#8226; Interest expense increased $189.1 million to $847.8 million on a year-over-year basis as interest expense on deposits rose $150.9 million and interest expense on borrowed funds rose $38.1 million. ##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#8226; The year-over-year increase in interest expenses on deposits was due to a $1.7 billion increase in the average balance of deposits, mostly CD balances, and a 44 basis point increase in the average cost of deposits to 1.84%. ##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#8226; The year-over-year increase in interest expense from borrowed funds was driven primarily by a 29 basis point increase in the average cost of borrowings, while the average balance of borrowed funds was relatively unchanged. ##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#8226; As a result, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $1.6 billion or 4.0% to $42.3 billion and our average cost increased 39 basis points to 2.01%. ##TABLE_END &#160;

Net Interest Margin 

The direction of the Company&#8217;s net interest margin was consistent with that of its net interest income, and generally was driven by the same factors as those described above. At 2.02%, the margin was 23-basis points narrower than the margin recorded for full-year 2018. Adjusted net interest margin is a non-GAAP

financial measure, as more fully discussed below.

RECONCILIATION OF NET INTEREST MARGIN AND ADJUSTED NET INTEREST MARGIN 

While our net interest margin, including the contribution of prepayment income and the impact from our recent subordinated notes offering, is recorded in accordance with GAAP, adjusted net interest margin, which excludes the contribution of prepayment income, is not. Nevertheless, management uses this non-GAAP

measure in its analysis of our performance, and believes that this non-GAAP

measure should be disclosed in this report and other investor communications for the following reasons:

##TABLE_START &#160; 1. Adjusted net interest margin gives investors a better understanding of the effect of prepayment income on our net interest margin. Prepayment income in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay, or securities that prepay, during that period. Such activity is largely dependent on external factors such as current market conditions, including real estate values, and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates. ##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; 2. Adjusted net interest margin is among the measures considered by current and prospective investors, both independent of, and in comparison with, our peers. ##TABLE_END &#160;

Adjusted net interest margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net interest margin, which is calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate this non-GAAP

measure may differ from that of other companies reporting a non-GAAP

measure with a similar name.

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our average balance sheet for the years indicated, including the average yields on our interest-earning assets and the average costs of our interest-bearing liabilities. Average yields are calculated by dividing the interest income produced by the average balance of interest-earning assets. Average costs are calculated by dividing the interest expense produced by the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average balances for the year are derived from average balances that are calculated daily. The average yields and costs include fees, as well as premiums and discounts (including mark-to-market

adjustments from acquisitions), that are considered adjustments to such average yields and costs.

Provision for (Recoveries of) Loan Losses 

Provision for (Recovery of) Losses on Loans 

The provision for losses on loans, like the recovery of loan losses, is based on the methodology used by management in calculating the allowance for losses on such loans. Reflecting this methodology, which is discussed in detail under &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; earlier in this report, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company reported a provision for loan losses of $7.1 million, down $11.2 million or 61% compared to $18.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The year-over-year decrease was related to taxi medallion-related charge-offs during the year. 

Reflecting the 2019 provision and twelve-month net charge-offs of $19.3 million, the allowance for losses on loans of $147.6 million decreased $12.2 million at the end of this December compared to $159.8 million at the prior year-end. 

For additional information about our methodologies for recording recoveries of, and provisions for, loan losses, see the discussion of the loan loss allowance under &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; and the discussion of &#8220;Asset Quality&#8221; that appear earlier in this report. 

Non-Interest

Income 

We generate non-interest

income through a variety of sources, including&#8212;among others&#8212;fee income (in the form of retail deposit fees and charges on loans); income from our investment in BOLI; gains on sales of securities; and &#8220;other&#8221; sources, including the revenues produced through the sale of third-party investment products.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, non-interest

income totaled $84.2 million, down $7.3 million or 8% compared to the $91.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. Included in the full-year 2018 amount was revenue of $20.3 million related to our wealth management business (which was sold during 2019), versus no such revenue in full-year 2019. Also included in the full-year 2019 period were net gains on securities of $7.7 million compared to a net loss on securities of $2.0 million in full-year 2018 and a branch sale-leaseback gain of $7.9 million compared to no such gains in full-year 2018.

IMPACT OF INFLATION 

The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires that we measure our financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, nearly all of a bank&#8217;s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, the impact of interest rates on our performance is greater than the impact of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or to the same extent, as the prices of goods and services. 

IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13,

Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework &#8211; Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The purpose of ASU No. 2018-13

is to improve the effectiveness of disclosures in the notes to financial statements by facilitating clear communication of the information required by GAAP that is most important to users of each entity&#8217;s financial statements. The amendments in ASU No. 2018-13

are effective for the Company as of January 1, 2020. The amendments remove the disclosure requirements for transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the disclosure of the policy for timing of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy, and the disclosure of the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally, the amendments modify the disclosure requirements for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value and measurement uncertainty. Finally, the amendments added disclosure requirements for the changes in unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 measurements. The amendments on changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. All other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. The adoption of ASU No. 2018-13

is not expected to have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04,

Intangibles&#8212;Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. ASU No. 2017-04

eliminates the second step of the goodwill impairment test which requires an entity to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill. Instead, an entity will recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill recorded. ASU No. 2017-04

does not amend the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment. The Company plans to adopt ASU No. 2017-04

prospectively beginning January 1, 2020 and the impact of its adoption on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition, results of operations, or cash flows will be dependent upon goodwill impairment determinations made after that date.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,

Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU No. 2016-13

amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held on an amortized cost basis and available-for-sale

debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost, ASU No. 2016-13

eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. Current GAAP requires an &#8220;incurred loss&#8221; methodology for recognizing credit losses that delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. The amendments in ASU No. 2016-13

replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects the measurement of expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical loss experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For available-for-sale

debt securities, credit losses should be measured in a manner similar to current GAAP but will be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, off-balance

sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash.

The Company has developed a CECL allowance model which calculates reserves over the life of the asset or off-balance sheet credit exposure and is largely driven by portfolio characteristics, risk-grading, economic outlook, and other key methodology assumptions. The Company has leveraged analyses derived from its stress testing processes in the development of CECL models. The Company will utilize a single economic forecast over a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period and will use straight-line reversion to historical losses. The Company expects not more than a 20% increase in the allowance for credit losses, which will decrease the opening stockholders equity balance as of January 1, 2020. The Company is in the process of finalizing the review of the most recent model run and finalizing assumptions including quantative adjustments and probable troubled debt restructurings, and implementation of operational processes and internal controls. 

RECONCILIATIONS OF STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY, COMMON STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY, AND TANGIBLE COMMON STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY; TOTAL ASSETS AND TANGIBLE ASSETS; AND THE RELATED MEASURES 

While stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, total assets, and book value per common share are financial measures that are recorded in accordance with U.S. GAAP, tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity, tangible assets, and tangible book value per common share are not. It is management&#8217;s belief that these non-GAAP

measures should be disclosed in this report and others we issue for the following reasons:

##TABLE_START &#160; 1. Tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity is an important indication of the Company&#8217;s ability to grow organically and through business combinations, as well as its ability to pay dividends and to engage in various capital management strategies. ##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; 2. Tangible book value per common share and the ratio of tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity to tangible assets are among the capital measures considered by current and prospective investors, both independent of, and in comparison with, the Company&#8217;s peers. ##TABLE_END &#160;

Tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity, tangible assets, and the related non-GAAP

measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, total assets, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate these non-GAAP

measures may differ from that of other companies reporting non-GAAP

measures with similar names.

Reconciliations of our stockholders&#8217; equity, common stockholders&#8217; equity, and tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity; our total assets and tangible assets; and the related financial measures for the respective periods follow:
