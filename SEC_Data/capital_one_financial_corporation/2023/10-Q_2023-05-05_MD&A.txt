INTRODUCTION 

Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation established in 1994 and headquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Capital One&#8221;) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through digital channels, branch locations, caf&#233;s and other distribution channels. 

As of March 31, 2023, Capital One Financial Corporation&#8217;s principal operating subsidiary was Capital One, National Association (&#8220;CONA&#8221;). On October 1, 2022, the Company completed the merger of Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (&#8220;COBNA&#8221;), with and into CONA, with CONA as the surviving entity (the &#8220;Bank Merger&#8221;). The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our.&#8221; References to the &#8220;Bank&#8221; shall mean and refer to (i) CONA from and after the Bank Merger and (ii) CONA and COBNA collectively prior to the Bank Merger. 

Our consolidated total net revenues are derived primarily from lending to consumer and commercial customers net of funding costs associated with deposits, long-term debt and other borrowings. We also earn non-interest income which primarily consists of interchange income, net of reward expenses, service charges and other customer-related fees. Our expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating expenses, marketing expenses and income taxes. 

Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customers served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category. The Other category also includes unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain restructuring charges, as well as residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments. 

&#8226; Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, and international card businesses in the United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;) and Canada. 

&#8226; Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit gathering and lending activities for consumers and small businesses, and national auto lending. 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

&#8226; Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering, capital markets and treasury management services to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. Our customers typically include companies with annual revenues between $20 million and $2 billion. 

Business Developments 

We regularly explore and evaluate opportunities to acquire financial products and services as well as financial assets, including credit card and other loan portfolios, and enter into strategic partnerships as part of our growth strategy. We also explore opportunities to acquire technology companies and related assets to improve our information technology infrastructure and to deliver on our digital strategy. We may issue equity or debt to fund our acquisitions. In addition, we regularly consider the potential disposition of certain of our assets, branches, partnership agreements or lines of business.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA 

The following table presents selected consolidated financial data and performance from our results of operations for the first quarters of 2023 and 2022 and selected comparative balance sheet data as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. We also provide selected key metrics we use in evaluating our performance, including certain metrics that are computed using non-GAAP measures. We consider these metrics to be key financial measures that management uses in assessing our operating performance, capital adequacy and the level of returns generated. We believe these non-GAAP metrics provide useful insight to investors and users of our financial information as they provide an alternate measurement of our performance and assist in assessing our capital adequacy and the level of return generated. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for reported results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;), nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP measures that may be presented by other companies.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Financial Highlights 

We reported net income of $960 million ($2.31 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $8.9 billion for the first quarter of 2023. In comparison, we reported net income of $2.4 billion ($5.62 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $8.2 billion for the first quarter of 2022. 

Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the Basel III standardized approach was 12.5% as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. See &#8220;Capital Management&#8221; for additional information. 

In January 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of shares of our common stock. In April 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $5.0 billion of shares of our common stock. Under these authorizations, we repurchased $4.8 billion of shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2022 and approximately $150 million of shares of our common stock during the first three months of 2023. See &#8220;Capital Management&#8212;Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases&#8221; for additional information. 

Below are additional highlights of our performance in the first quarter of 2023. These highlights are based on a comparison between the results of the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of March 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022. We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this &#8220;Executive Summary.&#8221; 

Total Company Performance 

&#8226; Earnings: 

Our net income decreased by $1.4 billion to $960 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily driven by: 

&#9702; Higher provision for credit losses primarily driven by an allowance build in our credit card loan portfolio due to continued credit normalization and assumed economic worsening compared to an allowance release across all of our segments in the first quarter of 2022. 

&#9702; Higher non-interest expense primarily driven by increased salaries and associate benefits. 

These drivers were partially offset by: 

&#9702; Higher net interest income primarily driven by higher average loan balances in our credit card loan portfolio. 

&#8226; Loans Held for Investment: 

&#9702; Period-end loans held for investment remained substantially flat at $308.8 billion as of March 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022. 

&#9702; Average loans held for investment increased by $32.4 billion to $307.8 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily driven by growth in our credit card loan portfolio. 

&#8226; Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: 

&#9702; Our net charge-off rate increased by 110 basis points (&#8220;bps&#8221;) to 2.21% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily driven by continued credit normalization. 

&#9702; Our 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 12 bps to 3.09% as of March 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by seasonally lower auto delinquency inventories, partially offset by continued credit normalization. 

&#8226; Allowance for Credit Losses: Our allowance for credit losses increased by $1.1 billion to $14.3 billion and our allowance coverage ratio increased by 40 bps to 4.64% as of March 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for the first quarters of 2023 and 2022. We provide a discussion of our business segment results in the following section, &#8220;Business Segment Financial Performance.&#8221; This section should be read together with our &#8220;Executive Summary,&#8221; where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income represents the difference between interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, while our interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, other borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees, net of reversals, on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Table 2 below presents the average outstanding balance, interest income earned, interest expense incurred and average yield for the first quarters of 2023 and 2022 for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Nonperforming loans are included in the average loan balances below.

__________ 

(1) Average yield is calculated based on annualized interest income for the period divided by average loans during the period. Annualized interest income does not include any allocations, such as funds transfer pricing. Average yield is calculated using whole dollar values for average balances and interest income/expense. 

(2) Past due fees, net of reversals, included in interest income totaled approximately $503 million and $438 million in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

(3) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. Taxable-equivalent adjustments included in the interest income and yield computations for our commercial loans totaled approximately $18 million as of both the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, with corresponding reductions to the Other category. 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

(4) Interest income/expense in the Other category represents the impact of hedge accounting on our loan portfolios and the offsetting reduction of the taxable-equivalent adjustments of our commercial loans as described above. 

** Not meaningful. 

Net interest income increased by $789 million to $7.2 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily driven by higher average loan balances in our credit card loan portfolio. 

Net interest margin increased by 11 bps to 6.60% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily driven by higher yields in our credit card and commercial banking loan portfolios, partially offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. 

Table 3 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to: 

&#8226; changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; or 

&#8226; changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities.

(1) We calculate the change in interest income and interest expense separately for each item. The portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. When the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive. 

(2) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. 

(3) Interest income/expense in the Other category represents the impact of hedge accounting on our loan portfolios and the offsetting reduction of the taxable-equivalent adjustments of our commercial loans as described above.

(1) Includes gain of $24 million and loss of $25 million on deferred compensation plan investments for the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts have corresponding offsets in non-interest expense. 

(2) Primarily consists of revenue from Capital One Shopping, our credit card partnership agreements and gains or losses on loan sales. 

Non-interest income remained substantially flat at $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for credit losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. Our provision for credit losses increased by $2.1 billion to $2.8 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily driven by an allowance build in our credit card loan portfolio due to continued credit normalization and assumed economic worsening compared to an allowance release across all of our segments in the first quarter of 2022. 

We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for credit losses within &#8220;Credit Risk Profile&#8221; and &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 4&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments.&#8221; For information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 8.

Non-interest expense increased by $394 million to $4.9 billion in the first three months of 2023, primarily driven by increased salaries and associate benefits. 

Income Taxes 

We recorded an income tax provision of $203 million (17.5% effective income tax rate) and $542 million (18.4% effective income tax rate) in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to the impact of changes in pre-tax income and changes in tax credits, tax-exempt income and non-deductible expenses relative to our pre-tax earnings. 

We provide additional information on items affecting our income taxes and effective tax rate in &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 15&#8212;Income Taxes&#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K.

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSIS 

Total assets increased by $16.4 billion to $471.7 billion as of March 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by increases in our cash balances due to our national banking consumer deposit strategy and an increase in our available for sale securities portfolio. 

Total liabilities increased by $14.3 billion to $417.0 billion as of March 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by deposit growth. 

Stockholders&#8217; equity increased by $2.1 billion to $54.7 billion as of March 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) due to an increase in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio and net income of $960 million. 

The following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during the first quarter of 2023. Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to support the adequacy of capital while managing our liquidity requirements, our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite. 

Investment Securities 

Our investment securities portfolio consists of the following: U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency (&#8220;Agency&#8221;) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;RMBS&#8221;), agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;), U.S. Treasury securities and other securities. Agency securities include Government National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Ginnie Mae&#8221;) guaranteed securities, Federal National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Fannie Mae&#8221;) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (&#8220;Freddie Mac&#8221;) issued securities. The carrying value of our investments in Agency and U.S. Treasury securities represented 97% of our total investment securities portfolio as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

The fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio increased by $5.0 billion to $81.9 billion as of March 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022, driven by net purchases and modest decreases in relevant benchmark interest rates. See &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 2&#8212;Investment Securities&#8221; for more information. 

Loans Held for Investment 

Total loans held for investment consists of both unsecuritized loans and loans held in our consolidated trusts. Table 6 summarizes, by portfolio segment, the carrying value of our loans held for investment, the allowance for credit losses and net loan balance as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Funding Sources 

Our primary source of funding comes from retail deposits, as they are a relatively stable and lower cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios.

(2) As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , we held $76.4 billion and $80.7 billion , respectively, of estimated uninsured deposits that exclude intercompany balances. These amounts are primarily comprised of checking and savings deposits. These estimated uninsured deposits comprise approximately 22% and 24% of our total deposits as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , respectively. We estimate our uninsured amounts based on methodologies and assumptions used for our &#8220;Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income&#8221; (FFIEC 031) filed with the Federal Banking Agencies. 

Total deposits increased by $16.8 billion to $349.8 billion as of March 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by our national banking strategy, which includes originations from periodic limited time offerings in time deposits. 

Securitized debt obligations increased by $840 million to $17.8 billion as of March 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by net issuances in our auto securitization program. 

Other debt decreased by $778 million to $31.0 billion as of March 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by maturities of subordinated debt, partially offset by net issuances of senior debt. 

We provide additional information on our funding sources in &#8220;Liquidity Risk Profile&#8221; and &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 7&#8212;Deposits and Borrowings.&#8221; 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in certain activities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. These activities typically involve transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;) as well as other arrangements, such as letters of credit, loan commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of our customers and support their ongoing operations. We provide additional information regarding these types of activities in &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 5&#8212;Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations&#8221; and &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 13&#8212;Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.&#8221; 

BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 

Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments, are included in the Other category. 

The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. Our business segment results are intended to reflect each 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

segment as if it were a stand-alone business. We use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results. Our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Total interest income and non-interest income are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. The net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process, which is primarily based on a matched funding concept that takes into consideration market interest rates. Our funds transfer pricing process is managed by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a charge for the use of funds by each segment. The allocation is unique to each business segment and acquired business and is based on the composition of assets and liabilities. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the funds transfer pricing process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the business segments. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 17&#8212;Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our &#8220;managed&#8221; presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

We summarize our business segment results for the first quarters of 2023 and 2022 and provide a comparative discussion of these results for, as well as changes in our financial condition and credit performance metrics as of March 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022. We provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 12&#8212;Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers.&#8221;

Credit Card Business 

The primary sources of revenue for our Credit Card business are net interest income, net interchange income and fees collected from customers. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses. 

Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $549 million and $1.5 billion in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Key factors affecting the results of our Credit Card business for the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 include the following: 

&#8226; Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $818 million to $4.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023 primarily driven by higher average loan balances. 

&#8226; Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income decreased by $95 million to $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023 primarily driven by the absence of the gain on sale of partnership card loan portfolios in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by higher net interchange fees due to an increase in purchase volume. 

&#8226; Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses increased by $1.7 billion to $2.3 billion in the first quarter of 2023 primarily driven by an allowance build due to continued credit normalization and assumed economic worsening compared to a substantially flat allowance for credit losses in the first quarter of 2022. 

&#8226; Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $255 million to $3.0 billion in the first quarter of 2023 primarily driven by increased salaries and associate benefits. 

Loans Held for Investment: 

&#8226; Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $588 million to $137.1 billion as of March 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily due to expected seasonal paydowns. 

&#8226; Average loans held for investment increased by $23.2 billion to $134.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily driven by growth across our portfolio. 

Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: 

&#8226; The net charge-off rate increased by 188 bps to 4.06% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily driven by continued credit normalization. 

&#8226; The 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 23 bps to 3.69% as of March 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by continued credit normalization. 

Domestic Card Business 

The Domestic Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $510 million and $1.3 billion in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. In the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, the Domestic Card business accounted for greater than 90% of total net revenue of our Credit Card business.

** Not meaningful. 

Because our Domestic Card business accounts for the substantial majority of our Credit Card business, the key factors driving the results are similar to the key factors affecting our total Credit Card business. Net income for our Domestic Card business decreased in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily driven by: 

&#8226; Higher provision for credit losses primarily driven by an allowance build due to continued credit normalization and assumed economic worsening compared to a flat allowance for credit losses in the first quarter of 2022. 

&#8226; Higher non-interest expense primarily driven by increased salaries and associate benefits. 

These drivers were partially offset by: 

&#8226; Higher net interest income primarily driven by higher average loan balances. 

&#8226; Higher non-interest income primarily driven by higher net interchange fees due to an increase in purchase volume. 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Consumer Banking Business 

The primary sources of revenue for our Consumer Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits as well as service charges and customer-related fees. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses. 

Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $716 million and $650 million in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively.

&#8226; Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $247 million to $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023 primarily driven by higher deposits and margins in our retail banking business due to the increases in interest rates, partially offset by lower margins in our auto business. 

&#8226; Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $30 million to $135 million in the first quarter of 2023 primarily driven by higher interchange fees from an increase in debit card purchase volume. 

&#8226; Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses increased by $145 million to $275 million in the first quarter of 2023 primarily driven by continued credit normalization. 

&#8226; Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense remained substantially flat at $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. 

Loans Held for Investment: &#160; 

&#8226; Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $1.8 billion to $78.2 billion as of March 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by an expected increase in seasonal payments, which outpaced auto loan originations. 

&#8226; Average loans held for investment remained substantially flat at $79.0 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. 

Deposits: 

&#8226; Period-end deposits increased by $20.6 billion to $291.2 billion as of March 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by our national banking strategy, which includes originations from periodic limited time offerings in time deposits. 

Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: &#160; 

&#8226; The net charge-off rate increased by 81 bps to 1.56% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily driven by continued credit normalization in our auto loan portfolio. 

&#8226; The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 72 bps to 5.46% as of March 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by seasonally lower auto delinquency inventories. 

Commercial Banking Business 

The primary sources of revenue for our Commercial Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income earned from products and services provided to our clients such as advisory services, capital markets and treasury management. Because our Commercial Banking business has loans and investments that generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits, we present the revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses and operating costs. 

Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $54 million and $296 million in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

We have identified the following accounting estimates as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows: 

&#8226; Loan loss reserves 

&#8226; Goodwill 

&#8226; Fair value 

&#8226; Customer rewards reserve 

We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary, based on changing conditions. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates described in our 2022 Form 10-K under &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 7. MD&#38;A&#8212;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.&#8221;

Standard Guidance Adoption Timing and Financial Statement Impacts Tax Credit Investments 

ASU 2023-02, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method 

Issued March 2023 

The amendments in this update permit reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless of tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method, if certain criteria are met. Previously, only Low-Income Housing Tax Credit investments were eligible to apply the proportional amortization method. 

This ASU becomes effective for us on January 1, 2024, with early adoption permitted and can be adopted using either a retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. We are currently assessing the potential impacts of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

The level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements as described in more detail below and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments. 

Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action 

The Company and the Bank are subject to the regulatory capital requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;), respectively (the &#8220;Basel III Capital Rules&#8221;). The Basel III Capital Rules implement certain capital requirements published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (&#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;), along with certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) and other capital provisions. 

As a bank holding company (&#8220;BHC&#8221;) with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion but less than $700 billion and not exceeding any of the applicable risk-based thresholds, the Company is a Category III institution under the Basel III Capital Rules. 

The Bank, as a subsidiary of a Category III institution, is a Category III bank. Moreover, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is subject to prompt corrective action (&#8220;PCA&#8221;) capital regulations. 

Basel III and United States Capital Rules 

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, we must maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% and a total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets. In addition, we must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. We are also subject to the capital conservation buffer requirement and countercyclical capital buffer requirement, each as described below. Our capital and leverage ratios are calculated based on the Basel III standardized approach framework. 

We have elected to exclude certain elements of AOCI from our regulatory capital as permitted for a Category III institution. 

Global systemically important banks (&#8220;G-SIBs&#8221;) that are based in the U.S. are subject to an additional CET1 capital requirement known as the &#8220;G-SIB Surcharge.&#8221; We are not a G-SIB based on the most recent available data and thus we are not subject to a G-SIB Surcharge. 

Stress Capital Buffer Rule 

The Basel III Capital Rules require banking institutions to maintain a capital conservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital, above the regulatory minimum ratios. Under the Federal Reserve&#8217;s final rule to implement the stress capital buffer requirement (the &#8220;Stress Capital Buffer Rule&#8221;), the Company&#8217;s &#8220;standardized approach capital conservation buffer&#8221; includes its stress capital buffer requirement (as described below), any G-SIB Surcharge (which is not applicable to us) and the countercyclical capital buffer requirement (which is currently set at 0%) . Any determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase, unless the Federal Reserve, OCC and the FDIC, hereafter collectively referred to as the &#8220;Federal Banking Agencies,&#8221; set an earlier effective date. 

The Company&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement is recalibrated every year based on the Company&#8217;s supervisory stress test results. In particular, the Company&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement equals, subject to a floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference between the Company&#8217;s starting CET1 capital ratio and its lowest projected CET1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s supervisory stress test plus (ii) the ratio of the Company&#8217;s projected four quarters of common stock dividends (for the fourth to seventh quarters of the planning horizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets for the quarter in which the Company&#8217;s projected CET1 capital ratio reaches its minimum under the supervisory stress test. 

Based on the Company&#8217;s 2022 supervisory stress test results, the Company&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023 is 3.1%. Therefore, the Company&#8217;s minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

stress capital buffer framework are 7.6%, 9.1% and 11.1%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023 . 

The Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply to the Bank. The capital conservation buffer for the Bank continues to be fixed at 2.5%. Accordingly, the Bank&#8217;s minimum capital requirements plus its capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5% respectively. 

If the Company or the Bank fails to maintain its capital ratios above the minimum capital requirements plus the applicable capital conservation buffer requirements, it will face increasingly strict automatic limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to certain executive officers. 

As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, the Company and the Bank each exceeded the minimum capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer requirements applicable to them, and the Company and the Bank were each &#8220;well-capitalized.&#8221; The &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; standards applicable to the Company are established in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulations, and the &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; standards applicable to the Bank are established in the OCC&#8217;s PCA capital requirements. 

Market Risk Rule 

The &#8220;Market Risk Rule&#8221; supplements the Basel III Capital Rules by requiring institutions subject to the rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading book. The Market Risk Rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion or more. As of March 31, 2023, the Company and the Bank are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See &#8220;Market Risk Profile&#8221; below for additional information. 

CECL Transition Rule 

The Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final rule (the &#8220;CECL Transition Rule&#8221;) that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the current expected credit losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) standard on their regulatory capital (the &#8220;CECL Transition Election&#8221;). We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the applicable amounts presented in this Report reflect such election. 

Pursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution could elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the &#8220;day 2&#8221; ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies used a uniform &#8220;scaling factor&#8221; of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax &#8220;day 1&#8221; CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax &#8220;day 1&#8221; CECL adoption impact and the cumulative &#8220;day 2&#8221; ongoing impact are being phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year. The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025. 

Capital Impact Delayed Phase In Period 

2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 &#8220;Day 1&#8221; CECL adoption impact Capital impact delayed to 2022 25% Phased In 50% Phased In 75% Phased In Fully Phased In Cumulative &#8220;day 2&#8221; ongoing impact 25% scaling factor as an approximation of the increase in allowance under CECL 

As of December 31, 2021, we added back an aggregate amount of $2.4 billion to our regulatory capital pursuant to the CECL Transition Rule. Consistent with the rule, we have phased in 50% of this amount, leaving $1.2 billion to be phased in over 2024-2025. As of March 31, 2023, the Company&#8217;s CET1 capital ratio, reflecting the CECL Transition Rule, was 12.5% and would have been 12.2% excluding the impact of the CECL Transition Rule (or &#8220;on a fully phased-in basis&#8221;). 

For the description of the regulatory capital rules to which we are subject, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K.

Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing 

In January 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of shares of our common stock. In April 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $5.0 billion of shares of our common stock. Under these authorizations, we repurchased $4.8 billion of shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2022 and approximately $150 million of shares of our common stock during the first three months of 2023. 

On April 5, 2023, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve as part of the 2023 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (&#8220;CCAR&#8221;) cycle. The stress testing results are expected to be released by the Federal Reserve by June 30, 2023. Our 2023 supervisory stress test result will determine the size of our stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024. 

For the description of the regulatory capital planning rules and stress testing requirements to which we are subject, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K.

The declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. As a BHC, our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. The Bank is subject to regulatory restrictions that limit its ability to transfer funds to our BHC. As of March 31, 2023, funds available for dividend payments from the Bank were $3.2 billion . There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders . 

In January 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of shares of our common stock. In April 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $5.0 billion of shares of our common stock. Under these authorizations, we repurchased $4.8 billion of shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2022 and approximately $150 million of shares of our common stock during the first three months of 2023. 

The timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including regulatory approval, market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and the amount of retained earnings. The Board authorized stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases, tender offers, or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. For additional information on dividends and stock repurchases, see &#8220;Capital Management&#8212;Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing&#8221; and &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1.

Credit Risk Measurement 

We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates are the key credit quality indicator for our credit card and retail banking loan portfolios as changes in delinquency rates can provide an early warning of changes in potential future credit losses. The key indicator we monitor when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they provide insight into borrower risk profiles, which give indications of potential future credit losses. The key credit quality indicator for our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings as we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming. In addition to these credit quality indicators, we also manage and monitor other credit quality metrics such as level of nonperforming loans and net charge-off rates. 

We underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which typically include credit bureau data, such as borrower credit scores, application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions. 

Table 21 provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(1) Percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Domestic Card credit scores generally represent FICO scores. These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category. 

(2) Percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Auto credit scores generally represent average FICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category. 

In our commercial loan portfolio, we assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, some of the factors considered are the borrower&#8217;s current financial condition, historical and projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. 

We present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. See &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 3&#8212;Loans&#8221; for additional credit quality information and see &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 8.

Delinquency Rates 

We consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer&#8217;s due date, measured at each balance sheet date. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify these loans as performing until the account is charged off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. See &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories.

Interest income foregone related to nonperforming loans was $35 million and $21 million in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Foregone interest income represents the amount of interest income in excess of recognized interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms. 

(2) Nonperforming loan rates are calculated based on nonperforming loans for each category divided by period-end total loans held for investment for each respective category. 

(3) Excluding the impact of domestic credit card loans, nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 0.73% and 0.74% as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

(4) The denominators used in calculating nonperforming asset rates consist of total loans held for investment and other nonperforming assets.

Net Charge-Offs 

Net charge-offs consist of the amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest, of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts as increases to the allowance for credit losses. Uncollectible finance charges and fees are reversed through revenue and certain fraud losses are recorded in other non-interest expense. Generally, costs to recover charged off loans are recorded as collection expenses as incurred and are included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. See &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories.

Financial Difficulty Modifications to Borrowers 

We adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures on January 1, 2023. The ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs and establishes disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which results in a more than insignificant impact to the timing or amount of contractual cash flows. 

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, a modification was deemed a TDR when the contractual terms of a loan agreement were modified by granting a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. ASU 2022-02 eliminated the concession requirement for modifications. After the adoption of ASU 2022-02, a financial difficulty modification (&#8220;FDM&#8221;) occurs when a modification in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, a term extension or a combination of these modifications is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. 

The types of modifications we offer to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty have not changed as a result of ASU 2022-02. As part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (one to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

to avoid the need for repossession or foreclosure of collateral. 

We consider the impact of all loan modifications, including FDMs, when estimating the credit quality of our loan portfolio and establishing allowance levels. For our Commercial Banking customers, loan modifications are also considered in the assignment of an internal risk rating. 

In our Credit Card business, the majority of our FDMs receive an interest rate reduction and are placed on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. The effective interest rate on the loan immediately prior to the loan modification is used as the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment using the present value of expected cash flows. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, generally resulting in any loan outstanding being reflected in the appropriate delinquency category and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy. 

In our Consumer Banking business, the majority of our FDMs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction, principal reduction, or a combination of these modifications. Impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto loans where the collateral value is lower than the amortized cost. 

In our Commercial Banking business, the majority of our FDMs receive an extension. A portion of FDMs receive an interest rate reduction, principal reduction, or a combination of modifications. 

For additional information on accounting standards adopted during the three months ended March 31, 2023, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.&#8221; For more information on FDMs in the first quarter of 2023 and TDRs in the first quarter of 2022, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 3&#8212;Loans.&#8221; 

Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments 

Our allowance for credit losses represents management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual terms of our loans held for investment as of each balance sheet date. Expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off are recognized within the allowance. We also estimate expected credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for credit losses in &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K.

LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILE 

We have established liquidity practices that are intended to ensure that we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover our funding requirements and maintain adequate reserves to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we maintain liquidity reserves in the form of investment securities and certain loans that are either readily-marketable or pledgeable. 

Table 28 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Table 28: Liquidity Reserves 

(Dollars in millions) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 46,513 &#160; $ 30,856 Securities available for sale 81,925 &#160; 76,919 FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans 5,888 &#160; 6,436 Outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit secured by loans and investment securities (50) (51) Other encumbrances of investment securities (7,579) (7,583) Total liquidity reserves $ 126,697 &#160; $ 106,577 

Our liquidity reserves increased by $20.1 billion to $126.7 billion as of March 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents. In addition to these liquidity reserves, we maintain access to a diversified mix of funding sources as discussed in the &#8220;Borrowing Capacity&#8221; and &#8220;Funding&#8221; sections below. See &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 7. MD&#38;A&#8212;Risk Management&#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on our management of liquidity risk. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

We are subject to the liquidity coverage ratio (&#8220;LCR&#8221;) standard as implemented by the Federal Reserve and the OCC (the &#8220;LCR Rule&#8221;). The LCR Rule requires each of the Company and the Bank to calculate its respective LCR daily. It also requires the Company to publicly disclose, on a quarterly basis, its LCR, certain related quantitative liquidity metrics, and a qualitative discussion of its LCR. Our average LCR during the first quarter of 2023 was 148% , which exceeded the LCR Rule requirement of 100%. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. See &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional information. 

Net Stable Funding Ratio 

The net stable funding ratio (&#8220;NSFR&#8221;) rule requires the Company and the Bank to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is a weighted measure of a company&#8217;s funding sources over a one-year time horizon, calculated by applying standardized weightings to equity and liabilities based on their expected stability, that is no less than a specified percentage of its required stable funding, which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets, derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics. As a Category III institution, the Company and the Bank are each required to maintain available stable funding in an amount at least equal to 85% of its required stable funding. The NSFR rule includes a semi-annual public disclosure requirement, with the first disclosure due 45 days after the end of the second quarter of 2023 . The Company and the Bank exceeded the NSFR rule requirement as of March 31, 2023. 

Borrowing Capacity 

We maintain a shelf registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) so that we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. In addition, we also maintain a shelf registration associated with our credit card securitization trust that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $30 billion of securitized debt obligations and a shelf registration associated with our auto loan securitization trusts that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $25 billion of securitized debt obligations. The registered amounts under these shelf registration statements are 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

subject to continuing review and change in the future, including as part of the routine renewal process. 

In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have access to FHLB advances, the Federal Reserve Discount Window, the Bank Term Funding Program and the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation&#8217;s general collateral financing repurchase agreement service. The ability to borrow utilizing these sources is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the Bank&#8217;s ability to post collateral. As of March 31, 2023, we pledged both loans and securities to the FHLB to secure a maximum borrowing capacity of $19.7 billion, of which $50 million was used. Our FHLB membership is supported by our investment in FHLB stock of $15 million as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, which was determined in part based on our outstanding advances. As of March 31, 2023, we pledged loans to secure a borrowing capacity of $16.9 billion under the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Our membership with the Federal Reserve is supported by our investment in Federal Reserve stock, which totaled $1.3 billion as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

The FDIC limits the acceptance of brokered deposits to well-capitalized insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the FDIC, to adequately-capitalized institutions. The Bank was well-capitalized, as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. See &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional information. We provide additional information on the composition of deposits in &#8220;Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis&#8212;Funding Sources Composition&#8221; and in &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 7&#8212;Deposits and Borrowings.&#8221; 

Funding 

Our primary source of funding comes from retail deposits, as they are a relatively stable and lower cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and securitized debt obligations, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. See &#8220;Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis&#8212;Funding Sources Composition&#8221; for additional information on our primary sources of funding. 

In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Our future cash outflows primarily relate to deposits, borrowings and operating leases. The actual timing and amounts of future cash payments may vary over time due to a number of factors, such as early debt redemptions and changes in deposit balances. 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt 

We access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, we have access to short-term and long-term FHLB advances secured by certain investment securities, multifamily real estate loans and commercial real estate loans. 

Our short-term borrowings, which include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less, typically consist of federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase or short-term FHLB advances, and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. Our short-term borrowings decreased by $341 million to $542 million as of March 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 driven by a decrease in repurchase agreements. 

Our long-term funding, which primarily consists of securitized debt obligations and senior and subordinated notes, increased by $403 million to $48.2 billion as of March 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by net issuances in our auto securitization program as well as the impacts of basis adjustments on hedged debt. We provide more information on our securitization activity in &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 5&#8212;Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations&#8221; and on our borrowings in &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 7&#8212;Deposits and Borrowings.&#8221;

Credit Ratings 

Our credit ratings impact our ability to access capital markets and our borrowing costs. Rating agencies assign their ratings based on numerous factors, including liquidity, capital adequacy, asset quality, quality of earnings and the probability of systemic support. Significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings. 

Table 31 provides a summary of the credit ratings for the senior unsecured long-term debt of Capital One Financial Corporation and CONA as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Other Commitments 

In the normal course of business, we enter into other contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Our other contractual obligations include lending commitments, leases, purchase obligations and other contractual arrangements. 

As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our total unfunded lending commitments were $425.0 billion and $409.3 billion, respectively, primarily consisting of credit card lines and loan commitments to customers of both our Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking businesses, as well as standby and commercial letters of credit. We generally manage the potential risk of unfunded lending commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities. For additional information, refer to &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 13&#8212;Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others&#8221; in this Report. 

Our primary involvement with leases is in the capacity as a lessee where we lease premises to support our business. The majority of our leases are operating leases of office space, retail bank branches and caf&#233;s. Our operating leases expire at various dates through 2071, although some have extension or termination options. As of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $1.7 billion , in aggregate operating lease liabilities. We provide more information on our lease activity in &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 7&#8212;Premises, Equipment and Leases&#8221; in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

We have purchase obligations that represent substantial agreements to purchase goods or receive services such as data management, media and other software and third-party services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify significant terms. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $612 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, in aggregate purchase obligation liabilities. 

We also enter into various contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments, including short-term obligations such as trade payables, commitments to fund certain equity investments, obligations for pension and post-retirement benefit plans, and representation and warranty reserves. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 5&#8212;Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations,&#8221; and &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1.

MARKET RISK PROFILE 

Our primary market risk exposures include interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity pricing risk. We are exposed to market risk primarily from the following operations and activities: 

&#8226; Traditional banking activities of deposit gathering and lending; 

&#8226; Asset/liability management activities including the management of investment securities, short-term and long-term borrowings and derivatives; 

&#8226; Foreign operations in the U.K. and Canada within our Credit Card business; and 

&#8226; Customer accommodation activities within our Commercial Banking business. 

We have enterprise-wide risk management policies and limits, approved by our Board of Directors, which govern our market risk management activities. Our objective is to manage our exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. We provide additional information below about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures that we use to evaluate these exposures. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate risk represents exposure to financial instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities. Our balance sheet is structurally asset sensitive as our loans, which are primarily floating rate or fixed rate with short durations, reprice faster than our fixed rate debt and a portion of our deposits when interest rates change. We take actions to reduce the interest rate risk from this structural balance sheet position primarily by investing in fixed rate securities in our 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

investment portfolio and executing interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments. 

We use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated funding and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. 

Net Interest Income Sensitivity 

Our net interest income sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month baseline net interest income resulting from movements in interest rates. In addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. We also incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit repricing, which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta and mix as interest rates change, and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected net interest income, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in Table 32 below. At the current level of interest rates, our net interest income is expected to increase in higher rate scenarios and decrease in lower rate scenarios. Our current sensitivity to both upward and downward shocks has increased modestly as compared to December 31, 2022, primarily due to the increase in cash balances driven by the growth in our deposit balances. Cash balances reprice relatively rapidly, whereas deposit rates reprice less with both lag and beta effects. In the contexts used in this section, &#8220;beta&#8221; refers to the percentage of deposit rate repricing relative to an external reference rate such as federal funds. In our models, deposit betas vary dynamically and by product type. 

Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity 

Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures, resulting from movements in interest rates. Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure is calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and does not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected balance sheet changes. Similar to our net interest income sensitivity measure, we incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit repricing and attrition, which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta as interest rates change and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates. Other key assumptions used in the calculation include attrition assumptions for loans and other assets, term structure modeling of interest rates and discount spreads. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in Table 32 below. Our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity decreases in higher interest rate scenarios and is largely unchanged in l ower interest rate scenarios. The decrease in higher rate scenarios is due to the declines in the projected value of our fixed rate assets being only partially offset by corresponding movements in the projected value of our deposits and other liabilities. The pace of economic value of equity decrease is larger for the +200 bps scenario as our deposits are assumed to reprice more rapidly in higher interest rate environments. Our current economic value of equity sensitivity is largely unchanged as compared to December 31, 2022. 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Table 32 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected baseline net interest income and our current economic value of equity calculated under the methodology described above as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. In instances where an interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0% for that scenario. This assumption applies only to jurisdictions that do not have a practice of employing negative policy rates. In jurisdictions that have negative policy rates, we do not floor interest rates at 0%. 

Table 32: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis 

March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Estimated impact on projected baseline net interest income: +200 basis points 1.5 &#160; % 0.4 % +100 basis points 1.3 &#160; 0.8 +50 basis points 0.6 &#160; 0.4 &#8211;50 basis points (0.8) (0.7) &#8211;100 basis points (1.6) (1.3) &#8211;200 basis points (3.4) (2.6) Estimated impact on economic value of equity: +200 basis points (4.8) (4.3) +100 basis points (1.7) (1.5) +50 basis points (0.8) (0.7) &#8211;50 basis points 0.5 &#160; 0.4 &#8211;100 basis points 0.8 &#160; 0.6 &#8211;200 basis points (0.4) (0.2) 

In addition to these industry standard measures, we consider the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios in our internal interest rate risk management decisions. We also regularly review the sensitivity of our interest rate risk metrics to changes in our key modeling assumptions, such as our loan and deposit balance forecasts, mortgage prepayments and deposit repricing. 

Limitations of Market Risk Measures 

The interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities. 

There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on our existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis. 

For further information on our interest rate exposures, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 8&#8212;Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.&#8221; 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Foreign Exchange Risk 

Foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily from the intercompany funding denominated in pound sterling (&#8220;GBP&#8221;) and the Canadian dollar (&#8220;CAD&#8221;) that we provide to our businesses in the U.K. and Canada and net equity investments in those businesses. We are also exposed to foreign exchange risk due to changes in the dollar-denominated value of future earnings and cash flows from our foreign operations and from our Euro (&#8220;EUR&#8221;)-denominated borrowings. 

Our non-dollar denominated intercompany funding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose our earnings to foreign exchange transaction risk. We manage these transaction risks by using forward foreign currency derivatives and cross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures. We measure our foreign exchange transaction risk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against the value of the non-dollar denominated intercompany funding and EUR-denominated borrowings and their related hedges, which shows the impact to our earnings from foreign exchange risk. Our nominal intercompany funding outstanding was 774 million GBP and 785 million GBP as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and 1.6 billion CAD and 1.7 billion CAD as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Our nominal EUR-denominated borrowings outstanding were 1.3 billion EUR as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Our non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations expose our balance sheet to translation risk in AOCI and our capital ratios. We manage our AOCI exposure by entering into foreign currency derivatives designated as net investment hedges. We measure these exposures by applying a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation shock, which we believe approximates a significant adverse shock over a one-year time horizon, against the value of the equity invested in our foreign operations net of related net investment hedges where applicable. Our gross equity exposures in our U.K. and Canadian operations were 1.9 billion GBP as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and 2.3 billion CAD and 2.2 billion CAD as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

As a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal. 

Risk related to Customer Accommodation Derivatives 

We offer interest rate, commodity and foreign currency derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business. We offset the majority of the market risk of these customer accommodation derivatives by entering into offsetting derivatives transactions with other counterparties. We use value-at-risk (&#8220;VaR&#8221;) as the primary method to measure the market risk in our customer accommodation derivative activities on a daily basis. VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from movements observed in the recent market environment. We employ a historical simulation approach using the most recent 500 business days and use a 99 percent confidence level and a holding period of one business day. As a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties, we believe that our net exposure to market risk in our customer accommodation derivatives is minimal. For further information on our risk related to customer accommodation derivatives, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 8&#8212;Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.&#8221; 

London Interbank Offered Rate Transition 

On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;), the regulator for the administration of the London Interbank Offered Rate Transition (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;), announced that LIBOR would be phased out as an interest rate benchmark and that it will no longer compel panel banks to contribute LIBOR data beyond December 31, 2021. 

On March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration (&#8220;IBA&#8221;), the administrator of LIBOR, confirmed its intention to cease publication of the 1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar (&#8220;USD&#8221;) LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR tenors (overnight; 1, 3, 6, and 12 months) immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. The continuation of USD LIBOR as a representative rate into mid-2023 will allow many legacy USD LIBOR contracts to mature prior to cessation. Following IBA&#8217;s announcement, the FCA formally announced the future permanent cessation and loss of representativeness of LIBOR benchmarks. The Federal Banking Agencies issued further guidance that banking organizations should cease using USD LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. Consistent with the Federal Banking Agencies&#8217; guidance, we ceased entering into new contracts referencing USD LIBOR as a reference rate as of January 1, 2022, subject to certain permissible exceptions. 

On December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board adopted the final rule that implemented the LIBOR Act. The LIBOR Act identified benchmark replacement rates based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) for covered derivative 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

transactions and cash transactions where a practicable interest rate fallback method has not been established by June 30, 2023, including those in which a government-sponsored enterprise is a party. 

Our enterprise LIBOR transition program team, which has been working on this effort since 2018 and includes senior management representatives from across the enterprise, provides monthly reporting to senior management and quarterly reporting to our Board of Directors. The information provided to senior management and the Board of Directors includes exposure reporting, updates on progress toward our goals to reduce our LIBOR exposure and relevant regulatory or industry developments. 

We continue to focus our LIBOR transition efforts on: 

&#8226; monitoring established controls to prevent the origination of impermissible LIBOR indexed instruments 

&#8226; working with impacted customers and counterparties to remediate remaining LIBOR contracts and our central counterparty clearinghouses for conversion of centrally cleared USD LIBOR products 

&#8226; engaging with our clients, industry working groups, and regulators 

&#8226; preparing to transition remaining contracts, including those with hardwired fallback language, operable legacy fallback language and those covered under the scope of the LIBOR Act. 

The majority of LIBOR contracts that we have transitioned to alternative rates have employed SOFR. In the U.S., SOFR has been selected as the preferred alternative rate by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (&#8220;ARRC&#8221;) for certain U.S. dollar derivative and cash instruments. We have proactively worked with customers and prepared our systems, models, valuation tools and processes to focus originations on SOFR and other non-LIBOR rates and will continue to do so as needed. While the majority of our non-LIBOR transactions have utilized SOFR, we have also employed credit sensitive alternative rates to LIBOR, to a limited extent, in response to customer demand. 

The majority of the instruments maturing after June 30, 2023 are derivatives and commercial loans, which are summarized in the table below. Of these instruments, the majority contain fallback language which adheres to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (&#8220;ISDA&#8221;) and ARRC standards. The LIBOR Act will allow us to transition LIBOR commitments without fallback language to an identified benchmark replacement rate based on SOFR after June 30, 2023.
