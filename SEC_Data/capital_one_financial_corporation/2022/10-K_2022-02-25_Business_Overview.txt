General 

Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation established in 1994 and headquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Capital One&#8221;) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through digital channels, branch locations, Caf&#233;s and other distribution channels. 

As of December 31, 2021, our principal subsidiaries included: 

&#8226; Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (&#8220;COBNA&#8221;), which offers credit card products along with other lending products and consumer services; and 

&#8226; Capital One, National Association (&#8220;CONA&#8221;), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients. 

The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our.&#8221; COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the &#8220;Banks.&#8221; References to &#8220;this Report&#8221; or our &#8220;2021 Form 10-K&#8221; or &#8220;2021 Annual Report&#8221; are to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. All references to 2021, 2020 and 2019, refer to our fiscal years ended, or the dates, as the context requires, December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Certain business terms used in this document are defined in the &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Glossary and Acronyms&#8221; and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. 

We were the third largest issuer of Visa&#174; (&#8220;Visa&#8221;) and MasterCard&#174; (&#8220;MasterCard&#8221;) credit cards in the U.S. based on the outstanding balance of credit card loans as of December 31, 2021. In addition to credit cards, we also offer debit cards, bank lending, treasury management and depository services, auto loans and other consumer lending products in markets across the U.S. As one of the nation&#8217;s largest banks based on deposits as of December 31, 2021, we service banking customer accounts through digital channels, as well as through branch locations, Caf&#233;s, call centers and automated teller machines (&#8220;ATMs&#8221;). 

We also offer products and services outside of the U.S. principally through Capital One (Europe) plc (&#8220;COEP&#8221;), an indirect subsidiary of COBNA organized and located in the United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;), and through a branch of COBNA in Canada. Both COEP and our Canadian branch of COBNA have the authority to provide credit card loans. 

Business Developments 

We regularly explore and evaluate opportunities to acquire financial products and services as well as financial assets, including credit card and other loan portfolios, and enter into strategic partnerships as part of our growth strategy. We also explore opportunities to acquire technology companies and related assets to improve our information technology infrastructure and to deliver on our digital strategy. We may issue equity or debt to fund our acquisitions. In addition, we regularly consider the potential disposition of certain of our assets, branches, partnership agreements or lines of business.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a global public-health crisis, disrupting economies and introducing significant volatility into financial markets. We transformed how we work in order to protect the well-being of our associates and our customers, and were able to continue to serve our customers, successfully manage critical functions, and keep our lines of business operating. 

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant majority of our associates across our workforce have transitioned to working remotely, relying on our technology infrastructure and systems that have been designed for resilience and security. The majority of our associates continue to work remotely. In the future, we plan to adopt a hybrid work methodology that allows for in-office collaboration while still enabling associates to work remotely. We continue to monitor local conditions to ensure the safety of our associates. 

For the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our financial results, refer to &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;).&#8221; The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments that are still uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; under the heading &#8220; Our results of operations may be adversely affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic .&#8221;

##TABLE_START OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS ##TABLE_END

Our consolidated total net revenues are derived primarily from lending to consumer and commercial customers net of funding costs associated with our deposits, long-term debt and other borrowings. We also earn non-interest income which primarily consists of interchange income, net of reward expenses, service charges and other customer-related fees. Our expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating expenses, marketing expenses and income taxes. 

Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customers served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category. Other category also includes unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain restructuring charges, as well as residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments. 

&#8226; Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, and international card businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom. 

&#8226; Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit gathering and lending activities for consumers and small businesses, and national auto lending. 

&#8226; Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering, capital markets and treasury management services to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. Our customers typically include companies with annual revenues between $20 million and $2 billion. 

Customer usage and payment patterns, estimates of future expected credit losses, levels of marketing expense and operating efficiency all affect our profitability. In our Credit Card business, we experience fluctuations in purchase volume and the level of outstanding loan receivables due to seasonal variances in consumer spending and payment patterns which, for example, have historically been the highest around the winter holiday season. Net charge-off rates for our credit card loan portfolio also have historically exhibited seasonal patterns as well and generally tend to be the highest in the first quarter of the year. 

For additional information on our business segments, including the financial performance of each business, see &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;)&#8212;Executive Summary and Business Outlook,&#8221; &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Business Segment Financial Performance&#8221; and &#8220;Note 17&#8212;Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#8221; of this Report. 

##TABLE_START 6 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START COMPETITION ##TABLE_END

Each of our business segments operates in a highly competitive environment, and we face competition in all aspects of our business from numerous bank and non-bank providers of financial services. 

Our Credit Card business competes with international, national, regional and local issuers of Visa and MasterCard credit cards, as well as with American Express &#174; , Discover Card &#174; , private-label card brands, and, to a certain extent, issuers of debit cards. In general, customers are attracted to credit card issuers largely on the basis of price, credit limit, reward programs and other product features. 

Our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses compete with national, state and direct banks for deposits, commercial and auto loans, as well as with savings and loan associations and credit unions for loans and deposits. Our competitors also include automotive finance companies, commercial mortgage banking companies and other financial services providers that provide loans, deposits, and other similar services and products. In addition, we compete against non-depository institutions that are able to offer these products and services. 

We also consider new and emerging companies in digital and mobile payments and other financial technology providers among our competitors. We compete with many forms of payment mechanisms, systems and products, offered by both bank and non-bank providers. 

Our businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and range of their products and services, transaction execution, innovation and price. Competition varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. Our ability to compete depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain our associates and on our reputation as well as our ability to keep pace with innovation, in particular in the development of new technology platforms. There can be no assurance, however, that our ability to market products and services successfully or to obtain adequate returns on our products and services will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may later develop, or by the broader economic environment. For a discussion of the risks related to our competitive environment, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

##TABLE_START SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ##TABLE_END

General 

The regulatory framework applicable to banking organizations is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the stability of the U.S. financial system, rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors. 

As a banking organization, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision. In addition to banking laws and regulations, we are subject to various other laws and regulations, all of which directly or indirectly affect our operations and management and our ability to make distributions to shareholders. We and our subsidiaries are also subject to supervision and examination by multiple regulators. In addition to laws and regulations, state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to us and our subsidiaries. Any change in the statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us, including changes in their interpretation or implementation, could have a material effect on our business or organization. 

Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased, initially in response to the financial crisis, and more recently in light of other factors such as technological, political and market changes. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. 

The descriptions below summarize certain significant federal and state laws, as well as international laws, to which we are subject. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions summarized. They do not summarize all possible or proposed changes in current laws or regulations and are not intended to be a substitute for the related statutes or regulatory provisions. 

Banking Regulation 

Capital One Financial Corporation is a bank holding company (&#8220;BHC&#8221;) and a financial holding company (&#8220;FHC&#8221;) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHC Act&#8221;), and is subject to the requirements of the BHC Act, including approval requirements for investments in or acquisitions of banking organizations, capital adequacy standards and limitations 

##TABLE_START 7 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

on non-banking activities. As a BHC and FHC, we are subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). Permissible activities for a BHC include those activities that are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, a FHC is permitted to engage in activities considered to be financial in nature (including, for example, securities underwriting and dealing and merchant banking activities), incidental to financial activities or, if the Federal Reserve determines that they pose no risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general, activities complementary to financial activities. 

To become and remain eligible for FHC status, a BHC and its subsidiary depository institutions must meet certain criteria, including capital, management and Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) requirements. Failure to meet such criteria could result, depending on which requirements were not met, in restrictions on new financial activities or acquisitions or being required to discontinue existing activities that are not generally permissible for BHCs. 

The Banks are national associations chartered under the National Bank Act, and the deposits of which are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) up to applicable limits. The Banks are subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;), the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;). Subject to obtaining all regulatory approvals, we plan to merge the Banks in the fourth quarter of 2022. There can be no assurance that the merger will take place in this time frame. After the completion of the merger, Capital One will conduct its core banking businesses through one subsidiary bank, Capital One, National Association. 

We also are registered as a financial institution holding company under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and, as such, we are subject to periodic examination by the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions. We also face regulation in the international jurisdictions in which we conduct business. See &#8220;Regulation of Businesses by Authorities Outside the United States&#8221; below for additional details. 

Regulation of Business Activities 

The business activities of the Company and the Banks are also subject to regulation and supervision under various laws and regulations. 

Regulations of Consumer Lending Activities 

The activities of the Banks as consumer lenders are subject to regulation under various federal laws, including, for example, the Truth in Lending Act (&#8220;TILA&#8221;), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the CRA, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and the Military Lending Act, as well as under various state laws. TILA, as amended, imposes a number of restrictions on credit card practices impacting rates and fees, requires that a consumer&#8217;s ability to pay be taken into account before issuing credit or increasing credit limits, and imposes revised disclosures required for open-end credit. 

Depending on the underlying issue and applicable law, regulators may be authorized to impose penalties for violations of these statutes and, in certain cases, to order banks to compensate customers. Borrowers may also have a private right of action for certain violations. Federal bankruptcy and state debtor relief and collection laws may also affect the ability of a bank, including the Banks, to collect outstanding balances owed by borrowers. 

Debit Interchange Fees 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires that the amount of any interchange fee received by a debit card issuer with respect to debit card transactions be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction. Rules adopted by the Federal Reserve to implement these requirements limit interchange fees per debit card transaction to $0.21 plus five basis points of the transaction amount and provide for an additional $0.01 fraud prevention adjustment to the interchange fee for issuers that meet certain fraud prevention requirements. 

##TABLE_START 8 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

Privacy, Data Protection and Cybersecurity 

We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, security, and other processing of personal information. These areas have seen a considerable increase in legislative and regulatory activity over the past several years. For example, in November 2021, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC (collectively, the &#8220;Federal Banking Agencies&#8221;) issued a final rule that, among other things, requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulators as soon as possible and no later than 36 hours after determining that a significant computer-security incident has occurred. 

In addition, significant uncertainty exists as privacy, data protection and data security laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country or state to state and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. For example, in the United States we are subject to the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;), among other laws and regulations, at the federal level, and in Canada we are subject to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (&#8220;PIPEDA&#8221;). In addition, the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;) applies EU data protection laws to companies that process data of EU residents, and we also are subject to the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;U.K. GDPR&#8221;). At the U.S. state level, we are subject to a number of laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;), which became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA and its implementing regulations, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;) (which will take effect in most material respects on January 1, 2023), create obligations on covered companies to, among other things, share certain information they have collected about individuals who are California residents with those individuals, subject to some exceptions. Many other states have also enacted or are considering enactment of state-level privacy, data protection and/or data security laws and regulations, with which we may be required to comply. 

We continue to monitor privacy, data protection and data security legal developments in the jurisdictions in which we do business. For further discussion of privacy, data protection and cybersecurity, and related risks for our business, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; under the headings &#8220; We face risks related to our operational, technological and organizational infrastructure ,&#8221; &#8220; A cyber-attack or other security incident, including one that results in the theft, loss or misuse of information (including personal information), or the disabling of systems and access to information critical to business operations, may result in increased costs, reductions in revenue, reputational damage, legal exposure and business disruptions ,&#8221; and &#8220; Our required compliance with applicable laws and regulations related to privacy, data protection and data security may increase our costs, reduce our revenue, increase our legal exposure and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities .&#8221; 

Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism 

The Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (&#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;) require financial institutions, among other things, to implement a risk-based program reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and to combat the financing of terrorism, including through suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting, compliance, record-keeping and customer due diligence. 

The Patriot Act also contains financial transparency laws and provides enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanisms to the U.S. government, including due diligence and record-keeping requirements for private banking and correspondent accounts; standards for verifying customer identification at account opening; rules to produce certain records upon request of a regulator or law enforcement agency; and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement agencies in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism, money laundering and other crimes. 

The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (&#8220;AML Act&#8221;), enacted on January 1, 2021 as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, does not directly impose new requirements on banks, but requires the U.S. Treasury Department to issue National Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Priorities, which it did in June 2021, and to conduct studies and issue regulations that may, over the next few years, significantly alter some of the due diligence, recordkeeping and reporting requirements that the Bank Secrecy Act and Patriot Act impose on banks. The AML Act also contains provisions that promote increased information-sharing and use of technology, and increases penalties for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and includes whistleblower incentives, both of which could increase the prospect of regulatory enforcement. 

##TABLE_START 9 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

Funding 

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;), as discussed in &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Liquidity Risk Profile,&#8221; only well capitalized and adequately capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits. Adequately capitalized institutions, however, must obtain a waiver from the FDIC before accepting brokered deposits, and such institutions may not pay rates that significantly exceed the rates paid on deposits of similar maturity obtained from the institution&#8217;s normal market area or, for deposits obtained from outside the institution&#8217;s normal market area, the national rate on deposits of comparable maturity. In December 2020, the FDIC finalized amendments to the brokered deposit regulation that, among other things, generally clarify and narrow the scope of the &#8220;deposit broker&#8221; definition. The amendments became effective April 1, 2021, with compliance required by January 1, 2022. 

The FDIC is authorized to terminate a bank&#8217;s deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the bank&#8217;s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the bank&#8217;s regulatory agency. 

Broker-Dealer and Investment Advisory Activities 

Certain of our non-bank subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by various federal and state authorities. Capital One Investing, Inc. (formerly known as United Income, Inc.) (&#8220;Capital One Investing&#8221;) is an investment adviser registered with the SEC and primarily regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. 

Capital One Securities, Inc., KippsDeSanto &#38; Company and TripleTree, LLC are registered broker-dealers regulated by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. These broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject, among other things, to net capital rules designed to measure the general financial condition and liquidity of a broker-dealer. Under these rules, broker-dealers are required to maintain the minimum net capital deemed necessary to meet their continuing commitments to customers and others, and to keep a substantial portion of their assets in relatively liquid form. These rules also limit the ability of a broker-dealer to transfer capital to its parent companies and other affiliates. Broker-dealers are also subject to regulations covering their business operations, including sales and trading practices, public offerings, publication of research reports, use and safekeeping of client funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. 

Derivatives Activities 

Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a regulatory framework for the governance of the over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) derivatives market, including swaps and security-based swaps and the registration of certain market participants as a swap dealer. CONA provisionally registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the &#8220;CFTC&#8221;) as a swap dealer in the third quarter of 2020. Registration as a swap dealer subjects CONA to additional regulatory requirements with respect to its swaps and other derivatives activities. As a result of CONA&#8217;s swap dealer registration, it is subject to the rules of the OCC concerning capital and margin requirements for swap dealers, including the mandatory exchange of variation margin and initial margin with certain counterparties. Additionally, as a provisionally registered swap dealer, CONA is subject to requirements under the CFTC&#8217;s regulatory regime, including rules regarding business conduct standards, recordkeeping obligations, regulatory reporting and procedures relating to swaps trading. CONA&#8217;s swaps and other derivatives activities do not require it to register with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

There are various legal restrictions on the extent to which we and our non-bank subsidiaries may borrow or otherwise engage in certain types of transactions with the Banks. Under the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve regulations, the Banks and their subsidiaries are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit, purchases of assets, and certain other transactions involving its non-bank affiliates. In addition, transactions between the Banks and their non-bank affiliates are required to be on arm&#8217;s length terms and must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness. 

Volcker Rule 

We and each of our subsidiaries, including the Banks, are subject to the &#8220;Volcker Rule,&#8221; a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that contains prohibitions on proprietary trading and certain investments in, and relationships with, covered funds (hedge funds, private equity funds and similar funds), subject to certain exemptions, in each case as the applicable terms are defined in the 

##TABLE_START 10 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

Volcker Rule and the implementing regulations. The implementing regulations also require that we establish and maintain a compliance program designed to ensure adherence with the requirements of the regulations. 

Capital and Liquidity Regulation 

The Company and the Banks are subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve and OCC respectively. For a further discussion of the capital adequacy guidelines, see &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Capital Management,&#8221; &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Liquidity Risk Profile&#8221; and &#8220;Note 11&#8212;Regulatory and Capital Adequacy.&#8221; 

Basel III and United States Capital Rules 

The Company and the Banks are subject to the regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC respectively (the &#8220;Basel III Capital Rules&#8221;). The Basel III Capital Rules implement certain capital requirements published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (&#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;), along with certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions. 

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, we must maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets. In addition, we must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. We are also subject to the capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements, as described below. 

Following amendments to the Basel III Capital Rules in October 2019 to provide for tailored application of certain capital requirements across different categories of banking institutions (the &#8220;Tailoring Rules&#8221;), the Company, as a BHC with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion but less than $700 billion and not exceeding any of the applicable risk-based thresholds, is a Category III institution. 

The Banks, as subsidiaries of a Category III institution, are Category III banks. Moreover, the Banks, as insured depository institutions, are subject to prompt corrective action (&#8220;PCA&#8221;) capital regulations, as further described below. 

As a Category III institution, effective January 1, 2020, we are no longer subject to the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework and certain associated capital requirements, and we have elected to exclude certain elements of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) from our regulatory capital as permitted for a Category III institution. We remain subject to the countercyclical capital buffer requirement (which is currently set at 0%) and supplementary leverage ratio requirement of 3.0%. 

Global systemically important banks (&#8220;G-SIBs&#8221;) that are based in the U.S. are subject to an additional CET1 capital requirement known as the &#8220;G-SIB Surcharge&#8221;. We are not a G-SIB based on the most recent available data and thus we are not subject to a G-SIB Surcharge. 

Stress Capital Buffer Rule 

The Basel III Capital Rules require banking institutions to maintain a capital conservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital, above the regulatory minimum ratios. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule to implement the stress capital buffer requirement (the &#8220;Stress Capital Buffer Rule&#8221;). The stress capital buffer requirement is institution-specific and replaces the fixed 2.5% capital conservation buffer previously in place for BHCs. 

Pursuant to the Stress Capital Buffer Rule, the Federal Reserve uses the results of its supervisory stress test to determine the size of a BHC&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement. In particular, a BHC&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement equals, subject to a floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference between the BHC&#8217;s starting CET1 capital ratio and its lowest projected CET1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s supervisory stress test plus (ii) the ratio of the BHC&#8217;s projected four quarters of common stock dividends (for the fourth to seventh quarters of the planning horizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets for the quarter in which the BHC&#8217;s projected CET1 capital ratio reaches its minimum under the supervisory stress test. 

Under the Stress Capital Buffer Rule framework, the Company&#8217;s &#8220;standardized approach capital conservation buffer&#8221; includes its stress capital buffer requirement (which will be recalibrated every year based on the Company&#8217;s supervisory stress test results), any G-SIB Surcharge (which is not applicable to us) and the countercyclical capital buffer requirement (which is currently set at 0%). Any determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase, unless the Federal Banking Agencies set an earlier effective date. 

##TABLE_START 11 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

Based on the Company&#8217;s 2021 supervisory stress testing results, the Company&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022 is 2.5%. Therefore, the Company&#8217;s minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022. 

The Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply to the Banks. The capital conservation buffer for the Banks continues to be fixed at 2.5%. Accordingly, each Bank&#8217;s minimum capital requirements plus its capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5% respectively. 

If the Company or any of the Banks fails to maintain its capital ratios above the minimum capital requirements plus the applicable capital conservation buffer requirements, it will face increasingly strict automatic limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to certain executive officers. 

See also &#8220;Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfers of Funds&#8221; below for more information about the stress capital buffer determination timeline and process. 

CECL Transition Rule 

The Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final rule (the &#8220;CECL Transition Rule&#8221;) that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the current expected credit losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) standard on their regulatory capital (the &#8220;CECL Transition Election&#8221;). We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020. 

Pursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution could elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the &#8220;day 2&#8221; ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies used a uniform &#8220;scaling factor&#8221; of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax &#8220;day 1&#8221; CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax &#8220;day 1&#8221; CECL adoption impact and the cumulative &#8220;day 2&#8221; ongoing impact are being phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year. The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025.

Market Risk Rule 

The &#8220;Market Risk Rule&#8221; supplements the Basel III Capital Rules by requiring institutions subject to the rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading book. The Market Risk Rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion or more. As of December 31, 2021, the Company and CONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Market Risk Profile&#8221; for additional information. 

FDICIA and Prompt Corrective Action 

The FDICIA requires the Federal Banking Agencies to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; for banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDICIA establishes five capital ratio levels: well capitalized; adequately capitalized; undercapitalized; significantly undercapitalized; and critically undercapitalized. The three undercapitalized categories are based upon the amount by which a bank falls below the ratios applicable to an adequately capitalized institution. The capital categories relate to the FDICIA&#8217;s PCA provisions, and such capital categories may not constitute an accurate representation of the Banks&#8217; overall financial condition or prospects. 

##TABLE_START 12 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

The Basel III Capital Rules updated the PCA framework to reflect new, higher regulatory capital minimums. For an insured depository institution to be well capitalized, it must maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or more; a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more; and a leverage ratio of 5% or more. An adequately capitalized depository institution must maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% or more; a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or more; a leverage ratio of 4% or more; and, for Category III and certain other institutions under the Tailoring Rules, a supplementary leverage ratio of 3% or more. The PCA provisions also authorize the Federal Banking Agencies to reclassify a bank&#8217;s capital category or take other action against banks that are determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or to have engaged in unsafe or unsound banking practices. 

As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions, the FDICIA required the Federal Banking Agencies to establish certain non-capital safety and soundness standards. The standards adopted by the Federal Banking Agencies relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure and executive compensation. The Federal Banking Agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards. 

Basel III and United States Liquidity Rules 

The Basel Committee has published a liquidity framework that includes two standards for liquidity risk supervision. One standard, the liquidity coverage ratio (&#8220;LCR&#8221;), seeks to promote short-term resilience by requiring organizations to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets (&#8220;HQLAs&#8221;) to survive a stress scenario lasting for 30 days. The other standard, the net stable funding ratio (&#8220;NSFR&#8221;), seeks to promote longer-term resilience by requiring sufficient stable funding over a one-year period based on the liquidity characteristics of the organization&#8217;s assets and activities. 

The Company and the Banks are subject to the LCR standard as implemented by the Federal Reserve and OCC (the &#8220;LCR Rule&#8221;). The LCR Rule requires the Company and each of the Banks to hold an amount of eligible HQLA that equals or exceeds 100% of its respective projected adjusted net cash outflows over a 30-day period, each as calculated in accordance with the LCR Rule. The LCR Rule requires us to calculate our LCR daily. In addition, the Company is required to make quarterly public disclosures of its LCR and certain related quantitative liquidity metrics, along with a qualitative discussion of its LCR. 

Under the Tailoring Rules, as a Category III institution with less than $75 billion in weighted average short-term wholesale funding, the Company&#8217;s and the Banks&#8217; total net cash outflows are multiplied by an outflow adjustment percentage of 85%. Although the Banks may hold more HQLA than they need to meet their LCR requirements, the LCR Rule restricts the amount of such excess HQLA held at the Banks (referred to as &#8220;Trapped Liquidity&#8221;) that can be included in the Company&#8217;s HQLA amount. Because we typically manage the Banks&#8217; LCRs to levels well above 100%, the result is additional Trapped Liquidity as the Banks&#8217; net cash outflows are reduced by the outflow adjustment percentage of 85%. 

In October 2020, the Federal Banking Agencies finalized a rule to implement the NSFR in the United States (the &#8220;NSFR Rule&#8221;). The NSFR Rule requires the Company and each of the Banks to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is a weighted measure of a company&#8217;s funding sources over a one-year time horizon, calculated by applying standardized weightings to equity and liabilities based on their expected stability, that is no less than a specified percentage of its required stable funding, which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets, derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics. As a Category III institution, the Company and the Banks are each required to maintain available stable funding in an amount at least equal to 85% of its required stable funding. The NSFR Rule became effective on July 1, 2021 and applies to the Company and each of the Banks. The NSFR Rule includes a semi-annual public disclosure requirement, with the first disclosure due 45 days after the end of the second quarter of 2023. 

Enhanced Prudential Standards and Other Related Requirements 

We are subject to certain enhanced prudential standards under the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;EGRRCPA&#8221;) and implemented by various regulations issued by the Federal Banking Agencies. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (&#8220;FSOC&#8221;) may also issue recommendations to the Federal Reserve or other primary financial regulatory agencies to apply new or enhanced standards to certain financial activities or practices. 

As part of the enhanced prudential standards, the Company is required to implement resolution planning for orderly resolution in the event it faces material financial distress or failure. The FDIC issued similar rules regarding resolution planning applicable to the Banks. In addition, the OCC has issued rules requiring banks with assets of $250 billion or more to develop recovery 

##TABLE_START 13 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

plans detailing the actions they would take to remain a going concern when they experience considerable financial or operational stress, but have not deteriorated to the point that resolution is imminent. 

The enhanced prudential standards also include supervisory and company-run stress testing requirements (also known as the &#8220;DFAST stress testing requirements&#8221;). In particular, the Federal Reserve is required to conduct annual stress tests on certain covered companies, including us, to ensure that the covered companies have sufficient capital to absorb losses and continue operations during adverse economic conditions, as well as to determine the Company&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement as described above. As a covered company that is a Category III institution under the Tailoring Rules, we are also required to conduct our own stress tests and publish the results of such tests on our website or other public forum. The Company must disclose the results of its company-run stress test on a biennial basis. The OCC has adopted a similar stress test rule requiring banks with at least $250 billion in assets, including CONA, to conduct their own company-run stress tests. Under that OCC rule, CONA must also disclose the results of its stress test on a biennial basis. 

In addition, the Company is required to meet liquidity risk management standards, conduct internal liquidity stress tests, and maintain a 30-day buffer of highly liquid assets, in each case, consistent with the requirements of the enhanced prudential standards. These requirements are in addition to the LCR and NSFR Rules, discussed above in &#8220;Basel III and United States Liquidity Rules.&#8221; The enhanced prudential standards also require that the Company comply with, and hold capital commensurate with, the requirements of, any regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve relating to capital planning and stress tests. Stress testing and capital planning regulations are discussed further below under &#8220;Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfers of Funds.&#8221; Finally, the Company is also required to establish and maintain an enterprise-wide risk management framework that includes a risk committee and a chief risk officer. 

Although not a requirement of the Dodd-Frank Act, the OCC established regulatory guidelines (&#8220;Heightened Standards Guidelines&#8221;) that apply heightened standards to the governance and risk management practices of large institutions subject to its supervision, including the Banks. The Heightened Standards Guidelines establish standards for the development and implementation by the Banks of a risk governance framework. 

Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfers of Funds 

Under the Federal Reserve&#8217;s capital planning rules and related supervisory process (commonly referred to as Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review or &#8220;CCAR&#8221; requirements), a &#8220;covered BHC,&#8221; such as the Company, must submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis that contains a description of all planned capital actions, including dividends or stock repurchases, over a nine-quarter planning horizon beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year the capital plan is submitted (&#8220;CCAR cycle&#8221;). 

The DFAST stress testing requirements, described above in &#8220;Enhanced Prudential Standards and Other Related Requirements,&#8221; is a complementary exercise to CCAR. It is a forward-looking exercise conducted by the Federal Reserve and each covered company to help assess whether a company has sufficient capital to absorb losses and continue operations during adverse economic conditions. 

Pursuant to the capital planning rules, the Company must file its capital plan with the Federal Reserve by April 5 of each year (unless the Federal Reserve designates a later date), using data as of the end of the prior calendar year. The Federal Reserve will release the results of the supervisory stress test and notify the Company of its stress capital buffer requirement by June 30 of that year. The Company will have two business days from receipt of its stress capital buffer requirement to make any necessary adjustments to its planned capital distributions. The Federal Reserve will then finalize the stress capital buffer requirement for the Company and confirm the Company&#8217;s planned capital distributions by August 31 of that year. The Company&#8217;s final stress capital buffer requirement will be effective from the fourth quarter of the year the capital plan is submitted through the third quarter of the following year. The Company may make the planned capital distributions confirmed by the Federal Reserve. In addition, under the Stress Capital Buffer Rule, the Company is no longer required to seek prior approval of the Federal Reserve to make capital distributions in excess of those included in its capital plan so long as the Company is otherwise in compliance with the capital rule&#8217;s automatic limitations on capital distributions. 

The Federal Reserve has announced that it would maintain its pre-CECL framework for calculating allowances on loans in the supervisory stress test through the 2023 cycle until the impact of CECL is better known and understood. 

Dividends from the Company&#8217;s direct and indirect subsidiaries represent a major source of the funds we use to pay dividends on our capital stock, make payments on our corporate debt securities and meet our other obligations. There are various federal law 

##TABLE_START 14 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

limitations on the extent to which the Banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to the Company through dividends and loans. These limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements, federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus, provisions of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates, as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices. In general, federal and applicable state banking laws prohibit insured depository institutions, such as the Banks, from making dividend distributions without first obtaining regulatory approval if such distributions are not paid out of available earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet applicable capital adequacy standards. 

Investment in the Company and the Banks 

Certain acquisitions of our capital stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal or state law. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of our capital stock in excess of the amount that can be acquired without regulatory approval, including under the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act (&#8220;CIBC Act&#8221;). 

Federal law and regulations prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of the Company or the Banks without, in most cases, prior written approval of the Federal Reserve or the OCC, as applicable. Control under the BHC Act exists if, among other things, a person or company acquires more than 25% of any class of our voting stock or otherwise has a controlling influence over us. A rebuttable presumption of control arises under the CIBC Act for a publicly traded BHC such as ourselves if a person or company acquires more than 10% of any class of our voting stock. 

Additionally, COBNA and CONA are &#8220;banks&#8221; within the meaning of Chapter 7 of Title 6.2 of the Code of Virginia governing the acquisition of interests in Virginia financial institutions (&#8220;Financial Institution Holding Company Act&#8221;). The Financial Institution Holding Company Act prohibits any person or entity from acquiring, or making any public offer to acquire, control of a Virginia financial institution or its holding company without making application to, and receiving prior approval from, the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions. 

Deposit Insurance Assessments 

Each of CONA and COBNA, as an insured depository institution, is a member of the DIF maintained by the FDIC. Through the DIF, the FDIC insures the deposits of insured depository institutions up to prescribed limits for each depositor. The FDIC sets a Designated Reserve Ratio (&#8220;DRR&#8221;) for the DIF. To maintain the DIF, member institutions may be assessed an insurance premium, and the FDIC may take action to increase insurance premiums if the DRR falls below its required level. 

As of June 30, 2020, the DIF reserve ratio fell to 1.30 percent. The FDIC, as required under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, established a plan in September 2020, to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed 1.35 percent within eight years. The FDIC&#8217;s restoration plan projects the reserve ratio to exceed 1.35 percent without increasing the deposit insurance assessment rate, subject to ongoing monitoring over the next eight years. 

Source of Strength and Liability for Commonly Controlled Institutions 

Under regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, a BHC must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks (the so-called &#8220;source of strength doctrine&#8221;). The Dodd-Frank Act codified this doctrine. 

Under the &#8220;cross-guarantee&#8221; provision of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (&#8220;FIRREA&#8221;), insured depository institutions such as the Banks may be liable to the FDIC with respect to any loss incurred, or reasonably anticipated to be incurred, by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or FDIC assistance to, any commonly controlled insured depository institution. The Banks are commonly controlled within the meaning of the FIRREA cross-guarantee provision. 

FDIC Orderly Liquidation Authority 

The Dodd-Frank Act provides the FDIC with liquidation authority that may be used to liquidate non-bank financial companies and BHCs if the Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President and based on the recommendation of the Federal Reserve and other appropriate Federal Banking Agencies, determines that doing so is necessary, among other criteria, to mitigate serious adverse effects on U.S. financial stability. Upon such a determination, the FDIC would be appointed receiver and must liquidate the company in a way that mitigates significant risks to financial stability and minimizes moral hazard. The costs of a liquidation of the company would be borne by shareholders and unsecured creditors and then, if necessary, by risk- 

##TABLE_START 15 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

based assessments on large financial companies. The FDIC has issued rules implementing certain provisions of its liquidation authority and may issue additional rules in the future. 

COVID-19 Developments 

In response to disruptions in economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, federal and state governments and agencies and government&#8209;sponsored enterprises (&#8220;GSE&#8221;) have taken a variety of actions to support people and entities affected by the pandemic, including the passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) in March 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act in April 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 in December 2020 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 in March 2021, among others. For example, the CARES Act established several programs with the Small Business Administration, including the Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;), to provide loans to small businesses. The CARES Act also gave banking organizations an option to temporarily suspend the determination of certain qualified loans modified as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as being troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;), which was extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 and expired on January 1, 2022. 

For a discussion of the risks associated with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; under the heading &#8220; Our results of operations may be adversely affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic .&#8221; 

Climate-related Developments 

Climate change and the risks it may pose to financial institutions is an area of increased focus by the Federal Banking Agencies as well as federal and state legislative bodies. In the future, new regulations or guidance may be issued, or other regulatory or supervisory actions may be taken, in this area by the Federal Banking Agencies or other regulatory agencies, or new statutory requirements may be adopted. For example, on December 16, 2021, the OCC requested feedback on draft principles designed to support the identification and management of climate-related financial risks at OCC-regulated institutions with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets. The OCC plans to use this feedback to inform any future guidance with respect to climate-related financial risk. 

Regulation of Businesses by Authorities Outside the United States 

COBNA is subject to laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions where it operates, currently in the United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;) and Canada. In the U.K., COBNA operates through COEP, which was established in 1999 and is an authorized payment institution regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;). COEP&#8217;s indirect parent, Capital One Global Corporation, is wholly-owned by COBNA and is subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve as an &#8220;agreement corporation&#8221; under the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation K. COEP does not take deposits. In Canada, COBNA operates as an authorized foreign bank and is permitted to conduct its credit card business in Canada through its Canadian branch, Capital One Bank (Canada Branch) (&#8220;Capital One Canada&#8221;). Capital One Canada does not take deposits. The primary regulator of Capital One Canada is the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. The foreign legal and regulatory requirements to which COBNA&#8217;s non-U.S. operation are subject include, among others, those related to consumer protection, business practices, privacy, data protection and limits on interchange fees. For more information on foreign privacy and data protection requirements, please see above &#8220;Regulation of Business Activities&#8212;Privacy, Data Protection and Cybersecurity.&#8221; For more information on foreign regulatory activity concerning interchange fees, please see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; under the heading &#8220; Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by merchants&#8217; increasing focus on the fees charged by credit and debit card networks and by legislation and regulation impacting such fees .&#8221;

##TABLE_START HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES ##TABLE_END

Our culture is rooted in putting people first with a focus on building and maintaining a workforce which fosters an inclusive environment based on diversity of our people, ideas and the merit of our work. Our workforce is our largest and one of our most valuable assets. We prioritize the recruitment, development, recognition and retention of the 50,767 employees worldwide that we had as of December 31, 2021, whom we refer to as &#8220;associates.&#8221; The following disclosures provide information on our human capital resources, including certain human capital objectives and measures that we focus on in managing our business. 

Governance of Human Capital 

Our full Board of Directors oversees our human capital management, including strategies, policies and practices, and diversity, inclusion and belonging (&#8220;DIB&#8221;), and is assisted by our Board&#8217;s Compensation Committee and Governance and Nominating Committee. Our Executive Committee, a committee of senior management which includes our Chief Human Resources Officer, advises, assists and makes recommendations to our Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors on human capital matters such as human resource practices and programs, including general employee benefits and compensation programs. Our Chief Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Officer (&#8220;Chief DIB Officer&#8221;) provides an update, at least annually, on the progress, success and challenges on workforce representation, trends and programs to the Board of Directors and Executive Committee. 

Hiring, Retention and Development 

We employ a comprehensive people strategy that includes significant investments in recruiting, sourcing and associate development to attract and retain top talent from all backgrounds to help drive our business&#8217; long-term success. We recruit through a variety of channels, including professional partnerships, job fairs, online platforms, on-campus recruiting, diversity-related recruiting events and initiatives, and internship and rotational programs, among others. We empower our associates to learn new skills, meet personalized development goals, and grow their careers. Investment in associate training and professional development is critical to maintaining our talent competitiveness. Our internal enterprise learning and development team blends multiple approaches to learning to support associate development across lines of business, levels, and roles, including online and live classroom training. In addition to formal programming provided by learning professionals, including regulatory compliance, role-specific topics and others, our peer-to-peer learning strategy empowers associates to be both learners and teachers, further enhancing a culture of learning. We also focus on cultivating talent with leadership development courses, cohort-based programs, network building and coaching. 

On a quarterly basis, we review our ability to attract and retain talent needed to deliver on our strategic business objectives. Each line of business and staff group reviews hiring, tenure and attrition metrics as part of this assessment, and they implement mitigation plans when needed. 

Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging 

We continuously strive to empower our associates to do great work by creating an equitable and inclusive workplace with a culture of belonging that values diverse perspectives, fosters collaboration and encourages innovative ideas. We aim to create a place where associates of all backgrounds can thrive by bringing their best, most authentic selves to work. Our diversity and inclusion efforts are overseen by our Chief DIB Officer. This culture of belonging rests at the heart of our DIB efforts. Central to this effort are our business resource groups, associate-led organizations which deepen our understanding of different cultures, backgrounds and experiences, and enable associates to build connections, invest in their professional development, and support our commitment to attract, develop and retain a diverse workforce. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Committee engage with leaders of our business resource groups to identify opportunities to further our DIB agenda, enact positive change and build on existing initiatives designed to nurture our culture and workplace environment. 

Growing the diversity of our workforce at all levels, with an emphasis on leader and executive roles, is an important component of our comprehensive DIB strategy. As of December 31, 2021, key measures of our workforce representation include: 

&#8226; Of the 13 members of our Board of Directors, 4 are women and 3 are people of color; 

&#8226; In the U.S., of the associates who are vice president level and above, approximately 33% are women and 24% are people of color; 

&#8226; In the U.S., approximately 50% of associates are people of color; and 

##TABLE_START 17 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) ##TABLE_END

&#8226; Worldwide, approximately 52% of associates are women and 48% of associates are men. 

Our corporate website contains additional information regarding programs and other information integral to our philosophy of diversity, inclusion and belonging. We believe in the importance of transparency and will also provide on our website the Consolidated EEO-1 Report in addition to submitting to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 

Compensation and Wellness 

We are committed to providing a competitive total compensation package that will attract, retain and motivate talent to help drive our business&#8217; long-term success. Our benefits, including competitive parental leave, on-site health centers, flexible work solutions, company contributions to associates&#8217; 401(k) plans, educational assistance and other health, wellness, and financial benefits, are all designed to help associates grow and develop inside and outside of the workplace and empower them in their lives. Furthermore, pay equity has long been a core tenet of our pay philosophy and is central to our values. We annually evaluate base pay and incentive pay for all of our associates globally. This review and evaluation may occur more frequently as deemed necessary and prudent. We review groups of associates in similar roles, adjusting for factors that appropriately explain differences in pay such as job location and experience. Based on our analysis, our aggregated adjusted pay gap results show that we pay women 100% of what men are paid, and we pay people of color in the U.S. 100% of what white associates are paid. We use statistical modeling to understand what drives pay gaps, instill new practices to eliminate pay gaps in the future, and if we find unexplained pay gaps, we close them. 

Communication and Connection 

We communicate with our associates regularly to understand their perspectives and to hear their voices. Our senior leaders and Chief Executive Officer also communicate directly on societal events impacting our associates. To assess and improve associate retention and engagement, the Company surveys associates on a periodic basis with the assistance of third-party consultants and takes actions to address areas of associate concern. We encourage full participation and use the results to effect change and promote transparency.

##TABLE_START ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ##TABLE_END

Technology/Systems 

We leverage information and technology to achieve our business objectives and to develop and deliver products and services that satisfy our customers&#8217; needs. A key part of our strategic focus is the development and use of efficient, flexible computer and operational systems, such as cloud technology, to support complex marketing and account management strategies, the servicing of our customers, and the development of new and diversified products. We believe that the continued development and integration of these systems is an important part of our efforts to reduce costs, improve quality and security and provide faster, more flexible technology services. Consequently, we continuously review capabilities and develop or acquire systems, processes and competencies to meet our unique business requirements. 

As part of our continuous efforts to review and improve our technologies, we may either develop such capabilities internally or rely on third-party outsourcers who have the ability to deliver technology that is of higher quality, lower cost, or both. We continue to rely on third-party outsourcers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure. These relationships include (but are not limited to): Amazon Web Services, Inc. (&#8220;AWS&#8221;) for our cloud infrastructure, Total System Services LLC (&#8220;TSYS&#8221;) for consumer and commercial credit card processing services for our North American and U.K. portfolios and Fidelity Information Services (&#8220;FIS&#8221;) for certain of our banking systems. 

We are committed to safeguarding our customers&#8217; and our own information and technology, implementing backup and recovery systems, and generally require the same of our third-party service providers. We take measures that mitigate against known attacks and use internal and external resources to scan for vulnerabilities in platforms, systems, and applications necessary for delivering our products and services. For a discussion of the risks associated with our use of technology systems, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; under the headings &#8220; We face risks related to our operational, technological and organizational infrastructure &#8221; and &#8220;A cyber-attack or other security incident, including one that results in the theft, loss or misuse of information (including personal information), or the disabling of systems and access to information critical to business operations, may result in increased costs, reductions in revenue, reputational damage, legal exposure and business disruptions.&#8221; 

Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Information 

As part of our overall and ongoing strategy to protect and enhance our intellectual property, we rely on a variety of protections, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and certain restrictions on disclosure, solicitation and competition. We also undertake other measures to control access to, or distribution of, our other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use certain intellectual property or proprietary information without authorization. Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information. In addition, our competitors and other third parties also file patent applications for innovations that are used in our industry. The ability of our competitors and other third parties to obtain patents may adversely affect our ability to compete and our financial results. Conversely, our ability to obtain patents may increase our competitive advantage, preserve our freedom to operate, and allow us to enter into licensing (e.g., cross-licenses) or other arrangements with third parties. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts, or that the ability of our competitors to obtain such patents may not adversely impact our financial results.

##TABLE_START FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ##TABLE_END

From time to time, we have made and will make forward-looking statements, including those that discuss, among other things: strategies, goals, outlook or other non-historical matters; projections, revenues, income, returns, expenses, capital measures, capital allocation plans, accruals for claims in litigation and for other claims against us; earnings per share, efficiency ratio, operating efficiency ratio or other financial measures for us; future financial and operating results; our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions; and the assumptions that underlie these matters. 

To the extent that any such information is forward-looking, it is intended to fit within the safe harbor for forward-looking information provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 

Forward-looking statements often use words such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;goal,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;forecast,&#8221; &#8220;outlook&#8221; or other words of similar meaning. Any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf speak only as of the date they are made or as of the date indicated, and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. For additional information on factors that could materially influence forward-looking statements included in this Report, see the risk factors set forth under &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; in this Report. You should carefully consider the factors discussed above, and in our Risk Factors or other disclosure, in evaluating these forward-looking statements. 

Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in such forward-looking statements, including, among other things: 

&#8226; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations may persist for an extended period or worsen, including labor shortages and disruption of global supply chains, and could impact our estimates of lifetime expected credit losses in our loan portfolios required in computing our allowance for credit losses; 

&#8226; general economic and business conditions in our local markets, including conditions affecting employment levels, interest rates, tariffs, collateral values, consumer income, creditworthiness and confidence, spending and savings that may affect consumer bankruptcies, defaults, charge-offs and deposit activity; 

&#8226; an increase or decrease in credit losses, or increased delinquencies, including increases due to a worsening of general economic conditions in the credit environment, and the impact of inaccurate estimates or inadequate reserves; 

&#8226; compliance with new and existing laws, regulations and regulatory expectations including the implementation of a regulatory reform agenda; 

&#8226; limitations on our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries; 

&#8226; our ability to manage adequate capital or liquidity levels, which could have a negative impact on our financial results and our ability to return capital to our stockholders; 

&#8226; the extensive use, reliability, disruption, and accuracy of the models and data on which we rely; 

&#8226; increased costs, reductions in revenue, reputational damage, legal liability and business disruptions that can result from data protection or privacy incidents or a cyber-attack or other similar incidents, including one that results in the theft, loss or misuse of information; 

&#8226; developments, changes or actions relating to any litigation, governmental investigation or regulatory enforcement action or matter involving us; 

&#8226; the amount and rate of deposit growth and changes in deposit costs; 

&#8226; our ability to execute on our strategic and operational plans; 

&#8226; our response to competitive pressures; 

&#8226; our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by merchants&#8217; increasing focus on the fees charged by credit and debit card networks and by legislation and regulation impacting such fees;
