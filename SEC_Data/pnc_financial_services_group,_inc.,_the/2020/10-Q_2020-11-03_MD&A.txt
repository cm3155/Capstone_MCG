FINANCIAL REVIEW
THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

This Financial Review, including the Consolidated Financial Highlights, should be read together with our unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and unaudited Statistical Information included
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Report or Form 10-Q) and with Items 6, 7, 8 and 9A of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K (2019 Form 10-K). We have reclassified certain prior
period amounts to conform with the current period presentation, which we believe is more meaningful to readers of our consolidated financial statements. For information regarding certain business,
regulatory and legal risks, see the following: the Risk Management section of this Financial Review and of Item 7 in our 2019 Form 10-K; Item 1A Risk Factors included in our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q
and our 2019 Form 10-K; and the Commitments and Legal Proceedings Notes of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report and our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q and
Item 8 of our 2019 Form 10-K. Also, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and the Critical Accounting Estimates And Judgments section in
this Financial Review and in our 2019 Form 10-K for certain other factors that could cause actual results or future events to differ, perhaps materially, from historical performance and from those
anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this Report. See Note 15 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for a reconciliation of total
business segment earnings to total PNC consolidated net income as reported on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. In this Report, “PNC”, “we” or “us” refers to The PNC Financial
Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (except when referring to PNC as a public company, its common stock or other securities issued by PNC, which just refer to The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc.). References to The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. or to any of its subsidiaries are specifically made where applicable.

The Executive Summary and Consolidated Income Statement Review portions of this Financial Review section provide information regarding items impacting the comparability of the periods
presented.
Dividends are payable quarterly other than Series O, Series R and Series S preferred stock, which are payable semiannually, with the Series O payable in different quarters than the Series R and Series S preferred
stock.
The effective income tax rates are generally lower than the statutory rate due to the relationship of pretax income to tax credits and earnings that are not subject
to tax.
Net interest margin is the total yield on interest-earning assets minus the total rate on interest-bearing liabilities and includes the benefit from use of noninterest-bearing sources. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margins, we
use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields used in the calculation of net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on
taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP in the Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, see Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (Non-GAAP) in the Statistical Information
(Unaudited) section in Item 1 of this Report.

The September 30, 2020 ratios are calculated to reflect PNC's election to adopt the CECL optional five-year transition provision, unless noted differently.
The September 30, 2020 fully implemented CET1 ratio is calculated to reflect the full impact of CECL and excludes the benefits of the five-year transition provision.
The 2020 and 2019 Basel III Total risk-based capital ratios include nonqualifying trust preferred capital securities of $40 million and $60 million, respectively, that are subject to a phase-out period that runs through 2021.
Ratios at  September 30, 2020 reflect the changes in methodology due to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard on January 1, 2020, along with increases in reserves during 2020 due to the significantly adverse
economic impact of the pandemic and its resulting effects on loan portfolio credit quality and loan growth.
Calculated as the Allowance for loan and lease losses plus the Allowance for unfunded lending related commitments divided by total loans.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we are one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United States (U.S.). We have businesses engaged in retail
banking, including residential mortgage, corporate and institutional banking and asset management, providing many of our products and services nationally. Our retail branch
network is located primarily in markets across the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southeast. We also have strategic international offices in four countries outside the U.S.

Key Strategic Goals

At PNC we manage our company for the long term. We are focused on the fundamentals of growing customers, loans, deposits and revenue and improving profitability, while
investing for the future and managing risk, expenses and capital. We continue to invest in our products, markets and brand, and embrace our commitments to our customers,
shareholders, employees and the communities where we do business.

We strive to serve our customers and expand and deepen relationships by offering a broad range of deposit, credit and fee-based products and services. We are focused on
delivering those products and services to our customers with the goal of addressing their financial objectives and putting customers’ needs first. Our business model is built on
customer loyalty and engagement, understanding our customers’ financial goals and offering our diverse products and services to help them achieve financial well-being. Our
approach is concentrated on organically growing and deepening client relationships across our businesses that meet our risk/return measures.

We are focused on our strategic priorities, which are designed to enhance value over the long term, and consist of:

•

•

•

Expanding our leading banking franchise to new markets and digital
platforms;
Deepening customer relationships by delivering a superior banking experience and financial solutions;
and
Leveraging technology to innovate and enhance products, services, security and
processes.

Our capital priorities are to support customers and business investment, maintain appropriate capital in light of economic conditions, the Basel III framework, and other
regulatory expectations, and return excess capital to shareholders. For more detail, see the Capital Highlights portion of this Executive Summary, the Liquidity and Capital
Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review and the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of our 2019 Form 10-K.

Current Economic Environment

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and public health response to contain it led to a severe recession in the first half of 2020, after the U.S. economy reached a peak in
economic activity in February 2020. Most measures of economic activity contracted with enormous declines in consumer spending, employment, retail sales, business
investment, industrial production and corporate profitability. The unemployment rate peaked at 14.7% in April and has declined since then, but still remained elevated at
7.9% in September. Real GDP growth in the third quarter was extremely strong, at an annual rate of 33.1%, after declining significantly in the first and second quarters of
2020. While economic conditions have improved, including a rebound in consumer spending and job growth, economic activity remains far below its pre-pandemic level.
There is still a great deal of uncertainty about the length and severity of the pandemic and the strength or reversal of the economic rebound, including whether there will be
additional fiscal stimulus from the federal government and, if so, its size and scope.

The Federal Reserve has undertaken extraordinary efforts to combat the economic weakness, reducing the federal funds rate 1.5 percentage points in March to a range of
0.00% to 0.25%. The Federal Reserve implemented multiple programs to support the flow of credit to businesses, consumers, and state and local governments, including, for
the first time, direct purchases of corporate bonds and of bank loans to small and medium-sized businesses. In addition, the federal government authorized $2.4 trillion in
federal spending to support household incomes and businesses, including the $1.8 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q 3  

PNC is committed to putting our resources to work to support our customers, communities and the broader financial system. PNC participated in funding Paycheck Protection
Program (PPP) loans under the CARES Act and, at September 30, 2020, had $12.9 billion of PPP loans outstanding, down from the $13.7 billion funded during the second
quarter of 2020. PNC continues to grant loan modifications for customers in need through various hardship relief programs. We analyze and make decisions on these
modifications based on each individual borrower's situation. PNC is also assisting customers with PPP loan forgiveness under the CARES Act. See the Troubled Debt
Restructurings and Loan Modifications in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for details on our commercial and
consumer loan modifications.

Our retail branch operations are gradually returning to business as usual as we continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our customers and employees. In the third
quarter of 2020, we progressively reopened branches both for appointment banking and full banking operations. As of the end of October 2020, approximately 96% of branch
lobbies were fully opened.

See the Recent Regulatory Developments section of this Financial Review as well as the Recent Regulatory Developments section in our first and second quarter 2020 Form
10-Q for additional detail on the CARES Act and other governmental responses to the pandemic and its economic and financial impacts. See also Risk Factors in Part II, Item
1A of our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q for a description of the associated risks.

Community Support

In the second quarter of 2020, we announced a commitment of more than $1.0 billion to help end systemic racism and support economic empowerment of African Americans
and low- and moderate-income communities including more than $50 million in additional charitable support for national and local work that is designed to help eliminate
systemic racism and promote social justice, expand financial education and workforce development initiatives and enhance low-income neighborhood revitalization and
affordable housing. In addition, this commitment will provide community development financing and capital for neighborhood revitalization, consumers, small businesses and
enhancements to PNC's existing matching gift program to include support for qualifying non-profit organizations that support economic empowerment and social justice
educational efforts.

Second Quarter Sale of Equity Investment in BlackRock, Inc.

In the second quarter of 2020, PNC divested its entire 22.4% equity investment in BlackRock. Net proceeds from the sale were $14.2 billion. The after-tax gain on the sale of
$4.3 billion, and donation expense and BlackRock's historical results for all periods presented, are reported as discontinued operations. For additional details on the divestiture
of our equity investment in BlackRock, see Note 2 Discontinued Operations in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report and the second quarter Form
10-Q.

Income Statement Highlights

Net income from continuing operations of $1.5 billion, or $3.39 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2020 increased $351 million, or 30%, compared to net
income from continuing operations of $1.2 billion, or $2.47 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2019.

•

•

•

Total revenue increased $39 million, or 1%, to $4.3
billion.

•

•

Net interest income of $2.5 billion decreased $20 million, or
1%.

▪

Net interest margin decreased to 2.39% compared to 2.84% for the third quarter of
2019.

Noninterest income increased $59 million, or 3%, to $1.8
billion.

Provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2020 of $52 million, which was calculated under the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) accounting standard
adopted January 1, 2020, reflected a provision recapture for consumer loans, offset by a provision for expected losses for certain borrowers in industries adversely
impacted by the pandemic, primarily within the commercial real estate portfolio. In addition, the third quarter 2020 provision for credit losses included $39 million
related to investment securities. Provision for credit losses decreased $131 million compared to the third quarter of 2019.
Noninterest expense decreased $92 million, or 4%, to $2.5 billion, reflecting a continuous focus on expense management as well as lower business activity related to
the economic impact of the pandemic.

• We generated positive operating leverage of 4.4% in the third quarter of 2020 and 4.3% for the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in

2019.

billion.
Total loans increased $9.4 billion, or 4%, to $249.3
billion.

•

•

Total commercial loans grew $12.1 billion, or 8%, to $172.7 billion, reflecting broad based growth including PPP loan originations under the CARES
Act.
Total consumer loans decreased $2.7 billion, or 3%, to $76.6 billion primarily in auto, credit card and home equity loans, partially offset by higher
residential mortgage loans.

Investment securities increased $4.4 billion, or 5%, to $91.2
billion.
Interest-earning deposits with banks, primarily with the Federal Reserve Bank, increased $47.5 billion to $71.0 billion due to higher liquidity from deposit growth and
proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in BlackRock.
Total deposits increased $66.5 billion, or 23%, to $355.1 billion due to growth in commercial deposits reflecting customer liquidity accumulation and higher
consumer deposits driven by government stimulus and lower consumer spending.
Borrowed funds decreased $18.2 billion, or 30%, to $42.1 billion reflecting use of liquidity from deposit growth and proceeds from the sale of our equity investment
in BlackRock.

Credit Quality Highlights

Credit quality metrics in the third quarter of 2020 reflected continued uncertainty in the economic environment.

At September 30, 2020 compared to December 31,
2019:
•

Nonperforming assets of $2.2 billion increased $400 million, or 23%, driven by higher nonperforming commercial loans in industries adversely impacted by
the pandemic and the energy industry.
Overall loan delinquencies of $1.2 billion decreased $266 million, or 18%, reflecting CARES Act and other forbearance and extension
treatments.

Net charge-offs were $155 million in both third quarters of 2020 and 2019, representing .24% of average loans on an annualized basis in the third quarter of 2020 and
.26% for the same quarter of 2019.
The allowance for credit losses (ACL) related to loans increased to $6.4 billion, or 2.58% of total loans, at September 30, 2020, calculated under the CECL
accounting standard adopted January 1, 2020, compared to $3.1 billion, or 1.28% of total loans, at December 31, 2019. The increase was due to the change in
methodology together with the significantly adverse economic impact of the pandemic and its resulting effects on loan portfolio credit quality and loan growth.

For additional detail, including the adoption of the CECL accounting standard and the significant economic impact of the pandemic, see the Credit Risk Management portion
of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review.

Capital Highlights

We grew our strong capital position.

The Basel III common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio increased to 11.7% at September 30, 2020 from 9.5% at December 31,
2019.
•

The September 30, 2020 ratio reflects higher capital due in part to the gain from the sale of our equity investment in BlackRock and changes under the
Tailoring Rules, effective January 1, 2020 for PNC, partially offset by the impact of the CECL accounting standard.
Additionally, capital benefited from our election of a five-year transition period for CECL's estimated impact on CET1 capital. CECL's estimated impact on
CET1 capital is defined as the change in retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date compared to
CECL ACL at transition. The estimated CECL impact is added to CET1 capital through December 31, 2021, then phased-out over the following three
years.

Common shareholders' equity increased 10% to $49.8 billion at September 30, 2020, compared to $45.3 billion at December 31,
2019.
On October 1, 2020, the PNC board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.15 per share payable on November 5,
2020.

• We announced on March 16, 2020 a temporary suspension of our common stock repurchase program in conjunction with the Federal Reserve's effort to support the
U.S. economy during the pandemic, and will continue the suspension through the fourth quarter of 2020, consistent with the extension of the Federal Reserve's
special capital distribution restrictions. We repurchased $99 million of common shares in the third quarter to offset the effects of employee benefit plan-related
issuances in 2020 as permitted by guidance from the Federal Reserve.

See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for more detail on our 2020 liquidity and capital actions as well
as our capital ratios.

PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding a stress capital buffer established by the
Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process. The Federal Reserve also has imposed
additional limitations on capital distributions through the fourth quarter of 2020 by CCAR-participating bank holding companies and may extend these limitations, potentially
in modified form. For additional information, see Capital Management in the Risk Management section in this Financial Review and the Supervision and Regulation section in
Item 1 Business of our 2019 Form 10-K.

Business Outlook

Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently
expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies. These statements are based on our views, as follow:

•

•

The U.S. economy is in a nascent economic recovery in the second half of 2020, following a very severe but very short economic contraction in the first half of
the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures to contain it. Real GDP declined significantly in the first and second quarters of 2020, as
many firms closed, at least temporarily, and consumers stayed at home. Since the late spring/early summer economic activity has picked up due to loosening
restrictions on businesses, massive federal stimulus, and extremely low interest rates. Between May and September the economy added back slightly more than
half of the 22 million jobs lost in March and April.
Despite the improvement in the economy in recent months, economic activity remains far below its pre-pandemic level and unemployment remains elevated.
Real GDP growth in the third quarter was extremely strong, at an annual rate of 33.1%, but will slow in the fourth quarter and through 2021. PNC does not
expect real GDP to return to its pre-pandemic level until late 2021, and does not expect employment to return to its pre-pandemic level until 2023. Risks to this
outlook are weighted to the downside; they include a further resurgence in the spread of the coronavirus and a lack of additional stimulus from the federal
government.

• Monetary policy remains extremely supportive of economic growth. PNC expects the Federal Open Market Committee to keep the federal funds rate in its

current range of 0.00% to 0.25% through at least mid-2024.

Given the many unknowns and risks being heavily weighted to the downside, our forward-looking statements are subject to the risk that conditions will be substantially
different than we are currently expecting. If efforts to contain COVID-19 are unsuccessful and restrictions on businesses and activities are not further lifted or are reimposed,
the recovery would be much weaker. There is even the potential that the economy could fall back into recession. PNC’s baseline scenario assumes additional fiscal stimulus;
continued inaction on stimulus is another major downside risk. The longer it takes to combat the pandemic the more permanent damage it will cause to business and consumer
fundamentals and sentiment; this could make the recovery weaker and result in permanently lower long-run economic growth. An extended global recession due to COVID-
19 would weaken the U.S. recovery. As a result, the outbreak and its consequences, including responsive measures to manage it, have had and are likely to continue to have
an adverse effect, possibly materially, on our business and financial performance by adversely affecting the demand and profitability of our products and services, the
valuation of assets and our ability to meet the needs of our customers.

•

•

For the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2020, we expect:
Average loans to decline in the low-single digits percentage
range;
Net interest income to be
stable;
Fee income to be stable and other noninterest income to be between $275 million and $325 million, resulting in our expectation that total noninterest income will be
down in the high-single digit percentage range;
Noninterest expense to be up approximately 1%;
and
Net loan charge-offs to be between $200 million and $250
million.

•

•

•

For the full year 2020, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage in the range of 3% to 4%.

See the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors in our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q and
2019 Form 10-K for other factors that could cause future events to differ, perhaps materially, from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.

Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as well as net interest margins, we use interest
income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable
investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement. For more information, see Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (Non-GAAP) in the Statistical
Information (Unaudited) section in Item 1 of this Report.

Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities
and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest
Analysis section of this Report for additional information.

Net interest income decreased $20 million, or 1%, and increased $45 million, or 1%, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, compared to the same
periods in 2019. The decrease in the quarterly comparison was attributable to lower yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower rates on deposits and borrowings
and higher average interest-earning assets. In the year-to-date comparison, the increase was driven by lower rates on deposits, higher average interest-earning assets and lower
borrowing costs and balances, partially offset by lower yields on interest-earning assets and higher average deposit balances. Net interest margin decreased 45 basis points in
the quarterly comparison and 34 basis points in the year-to-date comparison reflecting the reduction in the federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve in March 2020 and related
changes in other short-term rates which resulted in lower yields on loans and securities, partially offset by lower rates on deposits and borrowings. Additionally, the impact of
higher balances held with the Federal Reserve contributed to the margin declines.

Average investment securities increased $5.3 billion, or 6%, in the quarterly comparison and $4.1 billion, or 5%, in the year-to-date comparison. The increases were primarily
due to increases in agency residential mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by a decrease in U.S. Treasury and government agency securities in the year-to-date
comparison.

Average investment securities represented 22% of average interest-earning assets for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to 24% for the same
periods in 2019.

Average loans grew $15.4 billion, or 6%, and $21.2 billion, or 9%, in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, respectively. Loan growth was driven by an increase in both
commercial and consumer loans. Average commercial loans increased $14.2 billion and $17.5 billion in the respective comparisons reflecting broad based growth including
PPP lending under the CARES Act and higher utilization of loan commitments driven by the economic impact of the pandemic on customer liquidity preferences in the year-
to-date comparison.

Average consumer loans increased $1.2 billion and $3.7 billion in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, respectively. Growth in residential mortgage and home equity
was partially offset by lower credit card, education, and auto loans in the quarterly comparison. The year-to-date comparison reflected growth in residential mortgage, auto,
credit card and unsecured installment loans, partially offset by a decline in education loans due to runoff in the guaranteed government loan portfolio.

Average loans represented 61% of average interest-earning assets for the third quarter of 2020 and 65% for the first nine months of 2020 compared to 67% and 68% for the
same periods in 2019, respectively.

Average interest-earning deposits with banks increased $44.7 billion and $22.9 billion in the respective quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, as average balances held with
the Federal Reserve Bank increased due to higher liquidity from deposit growth and proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in BlackRock.

Average interest-bearing deposits grew $41.6 billion, or 20%, and $33.8 billion, or 17%, in the respective quarterly and year-to-date comparisons reflecting overall growth in
commercial and consumer deposits as well as pandemic-related accumulation of customer liquidity. In total, average interest-bearing deposits increased to 85% and 82% of
average interest-bearing liabilities for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to 76% for the same periods in 2019.

Average borrowed funds decreased $20.6 billion, or 32%, compared with the third quarter of 2019 and $10.8 billion, or 17%, compared to the first nine months of 2019
primarily due to a decline in Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings reflecting the use of liquidity from deposit growth and proceeds from the sale of our equity
investment in BlackRock.

Further details regarding average loans and deposits are included in the Business Segments Review section of this Financial Review.

Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 42% for the third quarter of 2020 and 41% for the first nine months of 2020 compared to 41% and 40% for the same
periods in 2019, respectively.

Asset management revenue in the year-to-date comparison declined due to the impact of PNC's divestiture activity in 2019 of the retirement recordkeeping business and
PNC's proprietary mutual funds partially offset by the impact of higher average equity markets. PNC's discretionary client assets under management decreased to $158 billion
at September 30, 2020 from $163 billion at September 30, 2019, primarily as a result of the fourth quarter 2019 sale of the proprietary mutual funds.

Consumer services revenue declined in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons as a result of lower transaction volumes and activity reflecting lower consumer spending.

Service charges on deposits decreased in both comparisons due to lower transaction volumes and fees waived for customers experiencing pandemic-related hardships and
lower revenue related to the elimination of certain checking product fees.

Corporate services revenue in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons increased due to higher revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities, asset-backed
financing fees, loans commitments fees and treasury management product revenue, partially offset by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees.

Residential mortgage revenue increased in both comparisons due to higher loan sales revenue partially offset by lower servicing fees due to increased payoff volumes.
Additionally, revenue from residential mortgage servicing rights (RMSR) valuation, net of economic hedge, was lower in the quarterly comparison and higher in the year-to-
date comparison.

Other noninterest income increased in the quarterly comparison and included higher revenue from net securities gains, capital markets-related activities and positive valuation
adjustments of private equity investments. In the year-to-date comparison, the increase was primarily attributable to higher net securities gains and capital markets-related
revenue, partially offset by lower revenue from private equity investments and lower gains on asset sales, including the second quarter 2019 divestiture of the retirement
recordkeeping business.

The decrease in noninterest expense in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons reflected lower business activity related to the economic impact of the pandemic, including
costs associated with business travel and lower marketing expense. In the year-to-date

comparison, personnel and occupancy expenses declined due to variable costs associated with decreased business activity, partially offset by higher equipment expense related
to technology investments.

Effective Income Tax Rate

The effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 9.8% in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 17.8% in the third quarter of 2019, and 7.6% in the first nine
months of 2020 compared to 17.0% in the same period in 2019. The decrease in both comparisons was primarily due to tax credit benefits and the favorable resolution of
certain tax matters in the third quarter of 2020.

(a) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the provision for unfunded lending related commitments was included in the provision for loans and leases.

The provision for credit losses decreased $131 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2019 and increased $2.9 billion for the first nine months of
2020 compared with the same period in 2019. The provision in the 2020 periods was calculated under the CECL accounting standard adopted January 1, 2020. The provision
for loans and leases in the third quarter of 2020 reflected a provision recapture for consumer loans, offset by a provision for expected losses for certain borrowers in industries
adversely impacted by the pandemic, primarily within the commercial real estate loan portfolio. In addition, the third quarter 2020 provision for credit losses included $39
million related to investment securities. The higher provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 reflected the change in methodology together with the
significantly adverse economic impact of the pandemic and its resulting effects on loan portfolio credit quality and loan growth.

The Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review includes additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for
credit losses.

(a) Represents our held for sale investment in BlackRock. In the second quarter of 2020, PNC divested its entire investment in BlackRock. Prior period BlackRock investment balances have been reclassified to the Asset held
for sale line in accordance with ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued Operations. Refer to Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 2 Discontinued Operations in the Notes To Consolidated
Financial Statements of this Report and the second quarter Form 10-Q for additional details.

(b) Amount as of September 30, 2020 reflects the impact of adopting the CECL accounting standard and our transition from an incurred loss methodology for these reserves to an expected credit loss methodology. Prior

period amounts represent ALLL under the incurred loss methodology. Refer to Note 1 Accounting Policies in this Report for additional detail on the adoption of this standard.

The summarized balance sheet data in Table 7 is based upon our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.

Our balance sheet was strong and well positioned at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

•

•

•

Total assets increased as a result of higher interest-earning deposits with banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Bank, loan growth, and higher investment
securities;
Total liabilities increased primarily due to deposit growth reflecting customer liquidity accumulation, partially offset by lower FHLB borrowings and federal funds
purchased;
Total equity increased primarily due to higher retained earnings driven by the gain on sale of our equity investment in BlackRock and higher accumulated other
comprehensive income (AOCI), partially offset by dividends on common and preferred stock, share repurchases, the day-one effect of adopting the CECL accounting
standard and the redemption of our Series Q preferred stock.

The ACL related to loans totaled $6.4 billion at September 30, 2020, an increase of $3.3 billion since December 31, 2019. The increase was attributable to a $.6 billion day-
one CECL transition adjustment and a $3.3 billion provision for credit losses, partially offset by net charge-offs of $.6 billion. The provision reflects the significantly adverse
economic impact of the pandemic and its resulting effects on loan portfolio credit quality and loan growth. See the following for additional information regarding our ACL
related to loans:

Commercial loans increased reflecting loan growth including PPP lending under the CARES Act. At September 30, 2020 PNC had $12.9 billion of PPP loans outstanding,
down from the second quarter funded amount of $13.7 billion.

For commercial and industrial loans by industry and commercial real estate loans by geography and property type, see Loan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis in the
Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review.

Total consumer loans declined as new originations decreased due to the economic impact of the pandemic and lower consumer spending. Residential mortgage loans
increased as the low interest rate environment resulted in an increase in origination volumes primarily of nonconforming loans, which are loans that do not meet agency
standards as a result of exceeding agency conforming loan limits.

For information on our home equity and residential real estate portfolios, including loans by geography, and our auto loan portfolio, see Loan Portfolio Characteristics and
Analysis in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Financial Review.

For additional information regarding our loan portfolio see Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses in the Notes To
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

Investment Securities

Investment securities of $91.2 billion at September 30, 2020 increased $4.4 billion, or 5%, compared to December 31, 2019, due primarily to net purchases and an increase in
the fair value of agency residential mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities.

The level and composition of the investment securities portfolio fluctuates over time based on many factors including market conditions, loan and deposit growth, and balance
sheet management activities. We manage our investment securities portfolio to optimize returns, while providing a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other
activities, considering the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and other internal and external guidelines and constraints. During 2020, $16.2 billion of debt securities were
transferred from held to maturity to available for sale pursuant to elections made under recently adopted accounting standards. See further discussion in Note 1 Accounting
Policies.

Table 9 presents the distribution of our total investment securities portfolio by amortized cost and fair value, as well as by credit rating. We have included credit ratings
information because we believe that the information is an indicator of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. Changes in credit ratings classifications could indicate
increased or decreased credit risk and could be accompanied by a reduction or increase in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio. We continually monitor the
credit risk in our portfolio and maintain the allowance for securities at an appropriate level to absorb expected credit losses on our investment securities portfolio for the
remaining contractual term of the securities adjusted for expected prepayments. See Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 3 Investment Securities in the Notes To
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the methodology for determining the allowance and the amount of the allowance for investment securities,
respectively.

The duration of investment securities was 2.2 years at September 30, 2020. We estimate that at September 30, 2020 the effective duration of investment securities was 2.7
years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 1.7 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates.

Based on expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio was 3.4 years at September 30, 2020 compared to 4.1
years at December 31, 2019.

Growth in total deposits reflected commercial and consumer customer liquidity accumulation, including from government stimulus and lower consumer spending.

Borrowed funds decreased due to lower FHLB borrowings, federal funds purchased (included in other borrowed funds) and bank notes and senior debt, reflecting the use of
liquidity from deposit growth and proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in BlackRock.

The level and composition of borrowed funds fluctuates over time based on many factors including market conditions, loan, investment securities and deposit growth, and
capital considerations. We manage our borrowed funds to provide a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering our LCR requirements and
other internal and external guidelines and constraints.

See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for additional information regarding our 2020 liquidity and
capital activities. See Note 8 Borrowed Funds in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Report for additional information related to our borrowings.

Shareholders’ Equity

Total shareholders’ equity was $53.3 billion at September 30, 2020, an increase of $4.0 billion, or 8%, compared to December 31, 2019. The increase resulted from net
income of $6.1 billion, which included the gain on sale of our equity investment in BlackRock, and higher AOCI of $2.2 billion, partially offset by common and preferred
stock dividends of $1.7 billion, common share repurchases of $1.4 billion, a day-one transition adjustment of $.7 billion for the adoption of the CECL accounting standard and
$.5 billion for the redemption of our Series Q preferred stock.

PNC announced on March 16, 2020 a temporary suspension of our common stock repurchase program in conjunction with the Federal Reserve's effort to support the U.S.
economy during the pandemic, and will continue the suspension through the fourth quarter of 2020, consistent with the extension of the Federal Reserve's special capital
distribution restrictions. PNC repurchased $99 million of common shares in the third quarter to offset the effects of employee benefit plan-related issuances in 2020 as
permitted by guidance from the Federal Reserve.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEW

We have three reportable business segments:

•

•

•

Retail
Banking
Corporate & Institutional
Banking
Asset Management
Group

Business segment results and a description of each business are included in Note 15 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.
Certain amounts included in this Business Segments Review differ from those amounts shown in Note 15, primarily due to the presentation in this Financial Review of
business net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.

During the second quarter of 2020, we divested our entire 22.4% investment in BlackRock. See Note 2 Discontinued Operations in the Notes To Consolidated Financial
Statements in this Report for additional information on the sale and details on our results and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019.
Following the sale and donation, PNC only holds shares of BlackRock stock in a fiduciary capacity for clients of PNC.

Net interest income in business segment results reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a
funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other factors.

Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in the “Other” category as shown in Table 81 in
Note 15 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure
as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses, ACL for investment securities, certain trading
activities, certain runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments, intercompany eliminations, certain corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to
business segments, exited businesses and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), including the presentation
of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as the segments’ results exclude their portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

See the Executive Summary of this Financial Review for our discussion of the impact of pandemic-related developments on our business and operations, including pandemic
relief efforts for our customers. We have granted loan modifications through various hardship relief programs to assist our customers in need during the pandemic. See Loan
Modifications in the Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan Modifications section of Credit Risk Management for details on these programs.

Retail Banking

Retail Banking's core strategy is to acquire and retain customers who maintain their primary checking and transaction relationships with us. We seek to deepen relationships
by meeting the broad range of our customers’ financial needs with savings, liquidity, lending, investment and retirement solutions. A strategic priority for us is to differentiate
the customer experience and drive transformation and automation. A key element of our strategy is to expand the use of lower-cost alternative distribution channels, with an
emphasis on digital capabilities, while continuing to optimize the traditional branch network. In addition, we have a disciplined process to continually improve the
engagement of both our employees and customers, which is a strong driver of customer growth, retention and relationship expansion.

Retail Banking had earnings of $508 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared with $936 million for the same period in 2019. The decrease in earnings was
attributable to a higher provision for credit losses and increased noninterest expense partially offset by higher net interest income and noninterest income.

Net interest income increased primarily due to growth in loan and deposit balances, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans and deposits.

Noninterest income increased largely due to growth in residential mortgage revenue attributable to increased loan sales revenue and higher revenue from residential mortgage
servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge, partially offset by lower servicing fees. The increase in noninterest income was partially offset by a decrease in service
charges on deposits and consumer services fees reflecting lower transaction volumes, fees waived to assist customers in the pandemic, lower consumer spending and the
elimination of certain checking product fees. The increase in noninterest income was also driven by lower negative derivative fair value adjustments related to Visa Class B
common shares of $22 million for the first nine months of 2020 compared with the negative adjustments of $55 million for the same period in 2019.

Provision for credit losses increased in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 reflecting changes in methodology due to the adoption of the CECL
accounting standard, together with the significantly adverse economic impact of the pandemic.

Higher noninterest expense primarily resulted from higher personnel, branch related expenses due in part to the impact of the pandemic, and equipment, partially offset by
lower advertising and marketing.

The deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances, executing on market-specific
deposit growth strategies and providing a source of low-cost funding and liquidity to PNC. In the first nine months of 2020, average total deposits increased compared to the
same period in 2019 primarily driven by growth in demand and savings deposits which increased due, in part, to a shift from money market deposits to relationship-based
savings products. Savings and demand deposits also benefited from the impact of government stimulus payments and lower consumer spending due to the pandemic.

Retail Banking average total loans increased in the first nine months of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.

Average residential mortgages increased primarily as a result of growth in nonconforming residential mortgage loans and a robust refinance market driven by
historically low interest rates.
Average commercial loans increased primarily due to PPP
loans.
Average auto loans increased primarily due to new indirect auto loan volumes, including in our Southeast and expansion
markets.
Average credit card balances increased as we continued to focus on our long-term objective of deepening penetration within our existing customer base as well as
new client acquisition.
Average unsecured installment loans increased primarily driven by growth in originations through digital
channels.
Average home equity loans increased as new originated volume exceeded paydowns and payoffs on
loans.
Average education loans decreased driven by a decline in the runoff portfolio of government guaranteed education
loans.

In 2018, we launched our national expansion strategy designed to grow customers with digitally-led banking and a thin branch network in markets outside of our existing
retail branch network and began offering a digital high yield savings deposit product and opened our first solution center in Kansas City. Solution centers are an emerging
branch operating model with a distinctive layout, where routine transactions are supported through a combination of technology and skilled banker assistance to create
personalized experiences. The primary focus of the solution center is to bring a community element to our digital banking capabilities. The solution center provides a
collaborative environment that connects our customers with our digital solutions and banking services, beyond deposits and withdrawals. Following the first solution center
opening in 2018, four additional solution centers opened in 2019 with a second in Kansas City and three in the Dallas/Fort Worth market. In the third quarter of 2020 we
expanded into three new markets, Boston, Houston and Nashville and opened eleven new solution centers including one location in Boston, three in Houston, three in
Nashville, and four in Dallas/Fort Worth. We also offer digital unsecured installment and small business loans in the expansion markets.

Retail Banking continues to enhance the customer experience with refinements to product and service offerings that drive value for consumers and small businesses. We are
focused on meeting the financial needs of our customers by providing a broad range of liquidity, banking and investment products. Retail Banking also continued to execute
on its strategy of transforming the customer experience through transaction channel migration, branch network and home lending process transformations and multi-channel
engagement and service strategies. We are also continually assessing our current branch network for optimization opportunities as usage of alternative channels has increased
and have closed 110 branches through the first nine months of 2020.

Approximately 73% of consumer customers used non-teller channels for the majority of their transactions in the first nine months of 2020 compared with 69% for the
same period in 2019.
Deposit transactions via ATM and mobile channels increased to 63% of total deposit transactions in the first nine months of 2020 from 57% for the same period in
2019.

Retail Banking continues to make progress on its multi-year initiative to redesign the home lending process, including integrating mortgage and home equity lending into a
common platform. Technology enhancements supported increased residential mortgage origination volume. In addition, we enhanced the home equity origination process to
make it easier and to reach additional customers. The enhanced product is currently available in twenty-four states and we are moving toward offering the product in most of
the remaining states in 2020 and 2021. Additional improvements for both mortgage and home equity are planned to continue through the remainder of 2020 and 2021.

Primarily nonperforming loans of $ .8 billion and $.5 billion at  September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019,
respectively.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q 19  

Corporate & Institutional Banking earned $.7 billion in the first nine months of 2020 compared to $1.8 billion for the same period in 2019, as higher provision for credit losses
was partially offset by higher revenue.

Net interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to higher average loan and deposit balances and wider interest rate spreads on the value of loans, partially offset
by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of deposits.

Growth in noninterest income in the comparison reflected broad-based increases including higher capital markets-related revenue, revenue from commercial mortgage
banking activities and treasury management product revenue.

Provision for credit losses increased in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, primarily reflecting changes in methodology due to the adoption of
the CECL accounting standard, together with the significantly adverse economic impact of the pandemic and its resulting effects on loan portfolio credit quality.

Nonperforming assets at September 30, 2020 and net loan and lease charge offs for the first nine months of 2020 increased over the comparative periods of 2019, primarily
related to industries adversely impacted by the pandemic and the energy industry.

Noninterest expense decreased in the comparison largely due to lower variable costs associated with decreased business activity related to the pandemic partially offset by
investments in strategic initiatives.

Average loans increased in the comparison across all businesses:

•

•

•

•

Corporate Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to mid-sized and large corporations, and government
and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business grew reflecting increased year-to-date average utilization due to the impact of draws made at the onset of
the pandemic and new production, including PPP loan originations.
PNC Real Estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Average loans for this business increased
primarily driven by higher commercial mortgage and multifamily agency warehouse lending, partially offset by project loan payoffs.
Commercial Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to smaller corporations and businesses. Average loans
for this business increased primarily driven by PPP loan originations.
Business Credit provides asset-based lending. The loan portfolio is relatively high yielding, with acceptable risk as the loans are mainly secured by short-term assets.
Average loans for this business increased primarily due to new originations, partially offset by lower utilization.

The deposit strategy of Corporate & Institutional Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances over time,
executing on customer and segment-specific deposit growth strategies and continuing to provide funding and liquidity to PNC. Average total deposits increased in the
comparison reflecting customers maintaining liquidity due to the economic impact of the pandemic. We continue to actively monitor the interest rate environment and make
adjustments in response to evolving market conditions, bank funding needs and client relationship dynamics.

Corporate & Institutional Banking continues to expand its Corporate Banking business, focused on the middle market and larger sectors. We are continuing to execute on our
expansion plans into the Seattle and Portland markets in 2020, and in 2021, we will continue our middle market expansion in San Antonio, Austin and San Diego. This follows
offices opened in Boston and Phoenix in 2019, Denver, Houston and Nashville in 2018, and Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis in 2017. These locations complement
Corporate & Institutional Banking national businesses with a significant presence in these cities, and build on past successes in the markets where PNC’s retail banking
presence was limited, such as in the Southeast. Our full suite of commercial products and services is offered in these locations.

Product Revenue
In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury management, capital markets-
related products and services and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other
services is included in net interest income, corporate service fees and other noninterest income. From a business perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to
these services is reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses. The Other Information
section in Table 13 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for these services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows.

The Treasury Management business provides payables, receivables, deposit and account services, liquidity and investments, and online and mobile banking products and
services to our clients. Treasury management revenue is reported in noninterest income and net interest income. Noninterest income includes treasury management product
revenue less earnings credits provided to customers on compensating deposit balances used to pay for products and services. Net interest income primarily includes revenue
from all treasury

management customer deposit balances. Compared with the first nine months of 2019, treasury management revenue increased primarily due to higher deposit balances and
product revenue, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of deposits.

Capital markets-related products and services include foreign exchange, derivatives, securities underwriting, loan syndications, mergers and acquisitions advisory and equity
capital markets advisory related services. The increase in capital markets-related revenue in the comparison was broad-based across most products and services and included
higher underwriting fees and fees on customer-related derivatives activities, partially offset by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees.

Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (both net interest income and noninterest income) and revenue derived
from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related hedges. Total revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities increased in the comparison due to higher
revenue across all activities.

Asset Management Group earned $173 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared with earnings of $171 million for the same period in 2019.

Net interest income increased due to higher average loan and deposit balances partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of deposits.

Noninterest income decreased due to lower asset management fees resulting from the impact of 2019 divestiture activities and the gain recognized on the retirement
recordkeeping business divestiture in the prior period, which was partially offset by increases in the average equity markets.

Noninterest expense decreased in the comparison and was primarily attributable to the impact of the 2019 divestitures and lower variable costs.

Provision for credit losses increased reflecting changes in methodology due to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard, together with the significantly adverse economic
impact of the pandemic.

Asset Management Group’s discretionary client assets under management decreased in comparison to the prior year primarily attributable to the sale of components of the
PNC Capital Advisors investment management business.

The Asset Management Group strives to be the leading relationship-based provider of investment, planning, banking and fiduciary services to wealthy individuals and
institutions by proactively delivering value-added ideas, solutions and exceptional service.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The Risk Management section included in Item 7 of our 2019 Form 10-K describes our enterprise risk management framework including risk culture, enterprise strategy, risk
governance and framework, risk identification, risk assessment, risk controls and monitoring, and risk aggregation and reporting. Additionally, our 2019 Form 10-K provides
an analysis of our key areas of risk, which include but are not limited to credit, liquidity and capital, market, operational, compliance and information security.

Credit Risk Management

Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk is inherent in the financial
services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts.
Credit risk is one of our most significant risks. Our processes for managing credit risk are designed to be embedded in our risk culture and in our decision-making processes
using a systematic approach whereby credit risks and related exposures are identified and assessed, managed through specific policies and processes, measured and evaluated
against our risk appetite and credit concentration limits, and reported, along with specific mitigation activities, to management and the Board of Directors through our
governance structure. Our most significant concentration of credit risk is in our loan portfolio.

Loan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis

Table 15: Details of Loans
In billions

We use several credit quality indicators, as further detailed in Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in
this Report, to monitor and measure our exposure to credit risk within our loan portfolio. The following provides additional information about our significant loan classes.

Commercial

Commercial and Industrial
Commercial and industrial loans comprised 55% and 52% of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The majority of our
commercial and industrial loans are secured by collateral that provides a secondary source of repayment for the loan should the borrower experience cash generation
difficulties. Examples of this collateral include short-term assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and securities, and long-lived assets, such as equipment, real estate
and other business assets.

We actively manage our commercial and industrial loans to assess any changes (both positive and negative) in the level of credit risk at both the borrower and portfolio level.
To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign internal risk ratings reflecting our estimates of the borrower’s probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) for each
related credit facility. This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring process and is updated on an ongoing basis through our
credit risk management processes. In addition to monitoring the level of credit risk, we also monitor concentrations of credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and
geography that may exist in our portfolio. Our commercial and industrial portfolio is well-diversified as shown in the following table which provides a breakout by industry
classification (classified based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)).

discussion within this Credit Risk Management section for additional discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our commercial portfolio and how we are evaluating and
monitoring the portfolio for elevated levels of credit risk.

Commercial Real Estate
Commercial real estate loans comprised $17.5 billion related to commercial mortgages, $6.8 billion of real estate project loans and $4.7 billion of intermediate term financing
loans as of September 30, 2020. Comparable amounts were $17.0 billion, $5.6 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.

We monitor credit risk associated with our commercial real estate loans similar to commercial and industrial loans by analyzing PD and LGD. Additionally, risks associated
with these types of credit activities tend to be correlated to the loan structure, collateral location, project progress and business environment. These attributes are also
monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk. The portfolio is geographically diverse due to the nature of our business involving clients throughout the U.S. The following
table presents our commercial real estate loans by geography and property type.

As of September 30, 2020, our outstanding loan balances in these industries totaled $18.3 billion, or approximately 7% of our total loan portfolio, while additional unfunded
loan commitments totaled $10.4 billion. We continue to carefully monitor and manage these loans, and while we have not yet experienced material charge-offs in these
industries, we expect to see charge-offs increase over time if the current economic trends continue.

In our non-real estate related category we have $10.5 billion in loans outstanding, $1.9 billion of which are funded through the PPP and guaranteed by the Small Business
Administration (SBA) under the CARES Act. Nonperforming loans in these industries totaled $.1 billion, or 1% of total loans outstanding in the non-real estate related
category, while criticized assets totaled $1.4 billion at September 30, 2020 with the greatest stress seen in the leisure recreation and leisure travel sectors.

Within the commercial real estate related category we have $7.8 billion in loans outstanding, which includes real estate projects of $4.9 billion and unsecured real estate of
$2.9 billion. Nonperforming loans in this category totaled $.2 billion at September 30, 2020, or 3% of total loans outstanding in the commercial real estate related category,
driven primarily by two real estate investment trust related loans. In this category, we continue to see substantial stress in the non-essential retail and hotel segments.

Oil and Gas Loan Portfolio
We are also monitoring our oil and gas portfolio closely for elevated levels of credit risk given the continued pressures on the energy industry. As of September 30, 2020, our
outstanding loans in the oil and gas sector totaled $3.6 billion, or 1.4% of total loans, which included $.1 billion funded through the PPP and guaranteed by the SBA under the
CARES Act. This portfolio comprised approximately $1.6 billion in the midstream and downstream sectors, $1.0 billion of oil services companies and $1.0 billion related to
exploration and production companies. Of the oil services category, approximately $.2 billion is not asset-based or investment grade. Nonperforming loans in the oil and gas
sector as of September 30, 2020 totaled $.2 billion, or 5.6% of total loans outstanding in this sector. Additional unfunded loan commitments for the oil and gas portfolio
totaled $7.1 billion at September 30, 2020.

Consumer

Home Equity
Home equity loans comprised $12.9 billion of primarily variable-rate home equity lines of credit and $11.6 billion of closed-end home equity installment loans at
September 30, 2020. Comparable amounts were $13.9 billion and $11.2 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.

We track borrower performance monthly, including obtaining original LTVs, updated FICO scores at least quarterly, updated LTVs at least semi-annually, and other credit
metrics at least quarterly, including the historical performance of any related mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold. This information is used for
internal reporting and risk management. For internal reporting and risk management we also segment the population into pools based on product type (e.g., home equity
loans, brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, brokered home equity lines of credit). As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment the
portfolio based upon the loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV, lien position and geographic concentration.

The credit quality of newly originated loans over the last twelve months was strong overall with a weighted-average LTV on originations of 67% and a weighted-average
FICO score of 773.

The credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we hold the first lien position is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second
lien position, but do not hold the first lien. Lien position information is generally determined at the time of origination and monitored on an ongoing basis for risk
management purposes. We use an industry-leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan information, including lien and collateral data that is aggregated from
public and private sources.

Residential Real Estate
Residential real estate loans primarily consisted of residential mortgage loans at both September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

We track borrower performance of this portfolio monthly similarly to home equity loans. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. For internal
reporting and risk management we also segment the mortgage portfolio into pools based on product type (e.g., nonconforming, conforming). As part of our overall risk
analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and
geographic concentrations. Loan performance is evaluated by source originators and loan servicers.

The credit quality of newly originated loans that we retained on our balance sheet over the last twelve months was strong overall as evidenced by a weighted-average LTV on
originations of 68% and a weighted-average FICO score of 773.

We originate residential mortgage loans nationwide through our national mortgage business as well as within our branch network. Residential mortgage loans underwritten to
agency standards, including conforming loan amount limits, are typically sold with servicing retained by us. We also originate nonconforming residential mortgage loans that
do not meet agency standards, which we retain on our balance sheet. The originated nonconforming residential mortgage portfolio had strong credit quality at September 30,
2020 with an average original LTV of 69% and an average original FICO score of 774. Our portfolio of originated nonconforming residential mortgage loans totaled $17.9
billion at September 30, 2020 with 41% located in California.

Automobile
Within auto loans, $13.4 billion resided in the indirect auto portfolio while $1.6 billion were in the direct auto portfolio as of September 30, 2020. Comparable amounts as of
December 31, 2019 were $15.1 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. The indirect auto portfolio pertains to loans originated through franchised dealers, including from
expansion into new markets. This business is strategically aligned with our core retail banking business.

We continue to focus on borrowers with strong credit profiles as evidenced by a weighted-average loan origination FICO score over the last twelve months of 777 for indirect
auto loans and 769 for direct auto loans. The weighted-average term of loan originations over the last twelve months was 72 months for indirect auto loans and 62 months for
direct auto loans. We offer both new and used auto financing to customers through our various channels. At September 30, 2020, the portfolio was composed of 56% new
vehicle loans and 44% used vehicle loans. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2019 were 55% and 45%, respectively.

The auto loan portfolio's performance is measured monthly, including updated collateral values that are obtained monthly and updated FICO scores that are obtained at least
quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product channel and product type and regularly evaluate default and delinquency
experience. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the portfolio by loan structure, collateral attributes and credit metrics which include FICO score,
LTV and term.

Nonperforming Assets and Loan Delinquencies

Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual principal and interest is not probable and
include nonperforming troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), other real estate owned (OREO) and foreclosed assets. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or
guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. Amounts as of December 31, 2019 also excluded purchased
impaired loans as we were accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans. In connection with the adoption of the CECL standard, nonperforming loans as of
September 30, 2020 include purchased credit deteriorated (PCD) loans which meet the criteria to be classified as nonperforming. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes
To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for details on our nonaccrual policies and additional information related to the adoption of the CECL standard, including
the discontinuation of purchased impaired loan accounting.

adverse economic impact of the pandemic and its resulting effects on loan portfolio credit quality and loan growth.

The increase in nonperforming assets at September 30, 2020 was primarily attributable to higher nonperforming commercial loans in industries adversely impacted by the
pandemic and the energy industry, partially offset by the decline in OREO and foreclosed assets due to asset sales and the suspension of pandemic-related foreclosures. See
the discussion of Commercial High Impact Industries and the Oil and Gas Loan Portfolio within this Credit Risk Management section for further detail on these industries.

As of September 30, 2020 approximately 83% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral, which lessened reserve requirements and is expected to reduce credit
losses. As of September 30, 2020, commercial nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 78% of their unpaid principal balance, due to charge-offs and interest
applied to principal, before consideration of the ALLL.

Within consumer nonperforming loans, residential real estate TDRs comprised 69% and 79% of total residential real estate nonperforming loans at September 30, 2020 and
December 31, 2019, respectively, while home equity TDRs comprised 44% and 49% of home equity nonperforming loans at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019,
respectively. TDRs generally remain in nonperforming status until a borrower has made at least six consecutive months of both principal and interest payments under the
modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally
reaffirmed their loan obligations to us and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not
returned to accrual status. Loans that have been restructured for COVID-19 related hardships and meet certain criteria under the CARES Act are not identified as TDRs. Refer
to the Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan Modifications discussion in this Credit Risk Management section for more information on the treatment of loan modifications
under the CARES Act.

At September 30, 2020, our largest nonperforming asset was $142 million in the Real Estate and Rental and Leasing industry and the ten largest individual nonperforming
assets represented 21% of total nonperforming assets.

Loan Delinquencies
We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels may be a key indicator of credit quality in our loan portfolio. Measurement of delinquency
status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies include
government insured or guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under the fair value option and at September 30, 2020 also include PCD loans. Amounts exclude loans held for
sale, while amounts as of December 31, 2019 also excluded purchased impaired loans.

Pursuant to the interagency guidance issued in April 2020 and in connection with the credit reporting rules from the CARES Act, the September 30, 2020 delinquency status
of loans modified due to COVID-19 related hardships aligns with the rules set forth for banks to report delinquency status to the credit agencies. These rules require that
COVID-19 related loan modifications be reported as follows:

•

•

•

if current at the time of modification, the loan remains current throughout the modification
period,
if delinquent at the time of modification and the borrower was not made current as part of the modification, the loan maintains its reported delinquent status during
the modification period, or
if delinquent at the time of modification and the borrower was made current as part of the modification or became current during the modification period, the loan is
reported as current.

As a result, certain loans modified due to COVID-19 related hardships are not being reported as past due as of September 30, 2020 based on the contractual terms of the loan,
even where borrowers may not be making payments on their loans during the modification period. Loan modifications due to COVID-19 related hardships that permanently
reduce either the contractual interest rate or the principal balance of a loan do not qualify for TDR relief under the CARES Act or the interagency guidance. See Recent
Regulatory Developments in Item 2 of our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q for more information on the CARES Act and the related interagency guidance.

Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan Modifications

Troubled Debt Restructurings
A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs result from our loss
mitigation activities and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and extensions, which are intended to minimize
economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Additionally, TDRs also result from court-imposed concessions (e.g., a Chapter 7 bankruptcy where the
debtor is discharged from personal liability to us and a court approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan). Loans to borrowers experiencing COVID-19 related hardships
that meet certain criteria under the CARES Act are not categorized as TDRs.

(b) Accruing loans include consumer credit card loans and loans that have demonstrated a period of at least six months of performance under the restructured terms and are excluded from nonperforming loans.

Nonperforming TDRs represented approximately 40% and 52% of total nonperforming loans at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and 53% and 51%
of total TDRs at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The remaining portion of TDRs represents TDRs that have been returned to accrual status after
performing under the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months.

See Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional
information on TDRs. For additional information on the CARES Act, see the Recent Regulatory Developments section in Item 2 of our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q.

Loan Modifications
During the third quarter of 2020, PNC continued to provide relief to our customers from the economic impacts of COVID-19 through a variety of solutions, including
additional grants and extensions of loan and lease modifications under our hardship relief programs.

Under the CARES Act, loan modifications meeting certain criteria qualify the loan for relief from TDR treatment. These criteria include:

•

•

•

the loan modification resulted from a COVID-19 related
hardship,
the borrower was no more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019,
and
the loan modification did not result in a permanent reduction of interest or
principal.

Loans that do not meet the criteria for TDR relief under the CARES Act may be evaluated under interagency guidance, which allows banks to not designate certain short-term
modifications as TDRs for borrowers with COVID-19 hardships who were current on their payments prior to the modification. Loans that are permanently modified or receive
longer term modifications under programs involving a change to loan terms due to customer financial difficulty and PNC concessions are evaluated for TDR accounting. For
additional information on the CARES Act and interagency guidance, see the Recent Regulatory Developments section in Item 2 of our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q.

The impact of these modifications was considered within the quarterly reserve determination. See the Allowance for Credit Losses discussion within the Critical Accounting
Estimates and Judgments section of this Financial Review for additional information. Refer to the Loan Delinquencies discussion in this Credit Risk Management section for
information on how these hardship related loan modifications are reported from a delinquency perspective as of September 30, 2020.

Commercial Loan and Lease Modifications Under COVID-19 Hardship Relief Programs
PNC is granting temporary loan and lease modifications to our commercial clients in the form of principal and/or interest (payment) deferrals, covenant waivers and other
types of modifications, including term extensions. We analyze and make decisions on these modifications based on each individual borrower's situation.

Initial payment deferrals are typically offered with terms up to 90 days. As noted in our second quarter 2020 Form 10-Q, we had granted deferrals on nearly 16,000
commercial accounts representing approximately $6.8 billion in hardship relief assistance through June 30, 2020. We have continued to selectively grant payment deferrals in
the third quarter of 2020, although the volume of this activity has declined considerably from earlier in the year. Following the expiration of these initial deferral periods, we
have also noted a low volume of clients requesting subsequent assistance. As of September 30, 2020, subsequent deferrals were minimal in our commercial hardship relief
programs.

(b) The amount of loan modifications that qualify for TDR accounting included in this table was immaterial.
(c) Based on total loans outstanding at September 30, 2020.

These modifications are considered to have exited active assistance after the deferral period has expired or the borrower has exited the modification. We are monitoring the
delinquency status of loans exiting relief programs as a measure to assess credit risk. As of September 30, 2020, approximately 99% of the accruing commercial loans that
have exited COVID-19 payment deferral programs were current or less than 30 days past due.

Consumer Loan Modifications Under Hardship Relief Programs
Our consumer loan modification programs are being granted in response to customer hardships. These temporary loan and line modifications include all hardship related

modifications, and the primary offerings as of September 30, 2020 are described in the following matrix.

Modification Type

Home Equity

Residential Real
Estate

Automobile

Credit Card

Education

Other Consumer

Extensions - Defers current payments and moves them to the end of the

loan by extending the loan's maturity or the extension re-amortizes the
remaining principal balance.

Forbearance - Part or all of the payments are deferred and moved to the end
of the forbearance period. Balance is due at the end of the forbearance
period, but payment options may be available to repay the forborne
amount, including for many borrowers an option to delay payment until
the payoff or maturity of the loan.

Minimum payment suspension - Reduces required minimum payment to $0

for a period of time.

New loan terms - Sets loan terms to a new monthly payment of principal

and interest based on customer's financial situation.

Reduced payments - Allows the customer to make a lower payment for a

period of time, with any deferred balance being moved to the end of the
loan term or extending the loan's maturity.

Repayment plan - Allows reduced payment and interest rate for a period of

time.

Interest continues to accrue during the relief period for loans modified in these programs unless the loan was designated as a nonperforming TDR or was on nonaccrual at the
date of modification. The method of collection of the accrued interest is dependent on the product type and modification offered.

As noted in our second quarter 2020 Form 10-Q, we had granted assistance on approximately 242,000 consumer accounts representing approximately $6.1 billion in hardship
relief assistance through June 30, 2020. We continue to offer options to our customers in response to hardship that extended beyond the initial relief period, but have seen a
notable decline in requests for assistance from the peak this summer.

The following table provides a summary of consumer accounts in active assistance under hardship relief programs that were on our balance sheet at September 30, 2020. We
have excluded government insured or guaranteed loans totaling $491 million and $268 million in the Residential real estate and Education loan classes, respectively, from
Table 25 as these loans present minimal credit risk to PNC.

Modifications are considered to have exited active assistance after the modification period has expired or the modification was exited. As of September 30, 2020,
approximately 96% of the accruing consumer loans that have exited hardship relief program modifications were current or less than 30 days past due.

The initial consumer loan modifications granted in response to the COVID-19 outbreak and the surrounding economic circumstances were short-term and temporary in nature
and generally meet the qualifications for relief from TDR treatment under the CARES Act. However, in response to customers' hardships that have extended beyond the
initial relief period, PNC has offered options to customers which include both temporary and permanent modifications that may reduce the payment, the interest rate or
extend the term and/or defer principal and interest payments. Permanent modifications would not meet the qualifications for relief from TDR treatment under the CARES Act.

Allowance for Credit Losses

On January 1, 2020 we adopted the CECL standard which replaced the incurred loss methodology for our credit related reserves with an expected credit loss methodology for
the remaining estimated contractual term of in-scope assets and off-balance sheet exposures. Our ACL is based on historical loss experience, borrower characteristics, current
economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions and other relevant factors. We maintain the ACL at an appropriate level for expected losses on
our existing investment securities, loans, finance leases, trade receivables and other financial assets and off-balance sheet credit exposures and determine this allowance based
on quarterly assessments of the remaining estimated contractual term of the assets or exposures as of the balance sheet date.

Expected losses are estimated using a combination of (i) the expected losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period (RSFP), (ii) a period of reversion to long run
average expected losses (reversion period) where applicable, and (iii) long run average (LRA) expected losses for the remaining estimated contractual term.

We use forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses for the RSFP. For this purpose, we have established a framework which includes a three year
reasonable and supportable forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios and associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected
economic outcomes over our RSFP of three years. Forward looking information, such as forecasted relevant macroeconomic variables, is incorporated into the expected credit
loss estimates using quantitative techniques, as well as through analysis from PNC's economists and management’s judgment in qualitatively assessing the ACL.

The reversion period is used to bridge RSFP and LRA expected credit losses. We may consider a number of factors in determining the duration of the reversion period, such
as contractual maturity of the asset, observed historical patterns and the estimated credit loss rates at the end of RSFP relative to the beginning of the LRA period.

The LRA expected credit losses are derived from our available historical credit information. We use LRA expected loss for the portfolio for the estimated remaining
contractual term beyond the RSFP and reversion period.

The following discussion provides additional information related to our reserves under CECL for loans and leases as well as unfunded lending related commitments. See Note
1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further discussion on our ACL, including details of our methodologies and
discussion of the allowances for investment securities and other financial assets. See also the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section of this Financial Review

for further discussion of the assumptions used in the determination of the ACL.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
Our pooled expected loss methodology is based upon the quantification of PD, LGD, exposure at default (EAD) and the remaining estimated contractual term for a loan or
loan segment. We also consider the impact of prepayments and amortization on contractual maturity in our expected loss estimates. We use historical data, current borrower
characteristics and forecasted economic variables in quantitative methods to estimate these risk parameters by loan or loan segments. PDs represent a quantification of risk
that a borrower may not be able to pay their contractual obligation over a defined period of time. LGD describes the estimate of potential loss if a borrower were to default,
and EAD (or utilization rates for revolving loans) is the estimated balance outstanding at the time of default and expected loss. These parameters are calculated for each
forecasted scenario, and are combined to generate expected loss estimates by scenario in proportion to the scenario weights.

We use a discounted cash flow methodology for our consumer real estate related loan classes and for certain commercial and consumer TDR loans. For non-TDR residential
real estate loans and lines, we determine effective interest rates considering contractual cash flows adjusted for prepayments and market interest rates. We then determine the
net present value of expected cash flows and ALLL by discounting contractual cash flows adjusted for both prepayments and expected credit losses using the effective interest
rates.

We establish individually assessed reserves for loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with a pool of loans using methods prescribed by GAAP.
Reserves for individual commercial nonperforming loans and commercial TDRs exceeding a defined dollar threshold are based on an analysis of the present value of the
loan’s expected future cash flows or the fair value of the collateral, if appropriate under our policy for collateral dependent loans. Commercial loans that are below the defined
threshold and accruing TDRs are collectively reserved for, as we believe these loans continue to share similar risk characteristics. For consumer nonperforming loans
classified as collateral dependent, charge-off and ALLL related to recovery of amounts previously charged-off are evaluated through an analysis of the fair value of the
collateral less costs to sell.

While our reserve methodologies strive to reflect all relevant credit risk factors, there continues to be uncertainty associated with, but not limited to, potential imprecision in
the estimation process due to the inherent time lag of obtaining information and normal variations between expected and actual outcomes. We may hold additional reserves
that are designed to provide coverage for losses attributable to such risks. A portion of the allowance is related to qualitative measurement factors. These factors may include,
but are not limited to, the following:

•

•

•

•

Industry concentrations and
conditions,
Changes in market conditions, including regulatory and legal
requirements,
Changes in the nature and volume of our
portfolio,
Recent credit quality trends, including the impact of COVID-19 hardship related loan
modifications,
Recent loss experience in particular portfolios, including specific and unique
events,
Recent macro-economic factors that may not be reflected in the forecast
information,
Limitations of available input data, including historical loss information and recent data such as collateral
values,
• Model

•

•

imprecision,
Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in loss recognition and mitigation policies and
procedures,
Timing of available information, including the performance of first lien positions,
and
Other relevant
factors.

Allowance for Unfunded Lending Related Commitments
We maintain the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments on off-balance sheet credit exposures that are not unconditionally cancelable, (e.g., unfunded loan
commitments, letters of credit and certain financial guarantees) at a level we believe is appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on these
exposures. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this reserve is estimated in a manner similar to the methodology used for determining reserves for loans and
leases. The allowance for unfunded lending related commitments is recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net adjustments to this reserve are included in
the provision for credit losses.

Total net charge-offs increased $170 million, or 39%, for the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in commercial net charge-offs
primarily related to industries adversely impacted by the pandemic and the energy industry, while the increases in credit card, automobile and other consumer loan net charge-
offs were due in part to loan portfolio growth.

Liquidity and Capital Management

Liquidity risk, including our liquidity monitoring measures and tools, is described in further detail in the Liquidity and Capital Management section of our 2019 Form 10-K.

One of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by reference to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure that covered
banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a hypothetical 30-day stress scenario. The LCR is calculated by
dividing the amount of an institution’s high quality, unencumbered liquid assets (HQLA), as defined and calculated in accordance with the LCR rules, by its estimated,
weighted net cash outflows, with net cash outflows determined by applying the assumed outflow factors in the LCR rules. The resulting quotient is expressed as a percentage.
Effective January 1, 2020, PNC and PNC Bank, as Category III institutions under the Tailoring Rules, were subject to a reduced LCR requirement, with each company's net
outflows reduced by 15%, thereby reducing the amount of HQLA each institution must hold to meet the LCR minimum requirement. The minimum LCR that PNC and PNC
Bank are required to

maintain continues to be 100%. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR daily, and as of September 30, 2020, the LCR for PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the requirement of
100%.

We provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on us in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business
and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2019 Form 10-K.

Sources of Liquidity
Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. These deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost
funding. Total deposits increased to $355.1 billion at September 30, 2020 from $288.5 billion at December 31, 2019, driven by growth in both interest-bearing and
noninterest-bearing deposits. See the Funding Sources portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review for additional information related to
our deposits. Additionally, certain assets determined by us to be liquid as well as unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to manage our
liquidity position.

At September 30, 2020, our liquid assets consisted of cash and due from banks and short-term investments (federal funds sold, resale agreements, trading securities and
interest-earning deposits with banks) totaling $80.0 billion and securities available for sale totaling $89.7 billion. The level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many
factors, including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. Our liquid assets included $23.2 billion of securities available for sale
and trading securities pledged as collateral to secure public and trust deposits, repurchase agreements and for other purposes. In addition, $.1 billion of securities held to
maturity were also pledged as collateral for these purposes.

We also obtain liquidity through various forms of funding, including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and FHLB borrowings) and short-term borrowings
(securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings). See Note 8 Borrowed Funds in the Notes To Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Funding Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in this Report and Note 10 Borrowed Funds in Item 8 of our 2019 Form 10-K for
additional information related to our borrowings.

Total senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, decreased due to the following activity:

Bank Liquidity
Under PNC Bank’s 2014 bank note program, as amended, PNC Bank may from time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time
of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated
notes) from their date of issue. At September 30, 2020, PNC Bank had $21.6 billion of notes outstanding under this program of which $16.6 billion were senior bank notes
and $5.0 billion were subordinated bank notes.

PNC Bank maintains additional secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB-Pittsburgh and through the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. The Federal Reserve Bank,
however, is not viewed as a primary means of funding our routine business activities, but rather as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market
disruption. At September 30, 2020, our unused secured borrowing capacity at the FHLB-Pittsburgh and the Federal Reserve Bank totaled $79.4 billion. The Federal Reserve
also has established certain special liquidity facilities under its emergency lending authority in Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act in response to the economic impact of
the pandemic. For additional information on these special liquidity facilities see the Recent Regulatory Developments section of the first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q and second
quarter 2020 Form 10-Q.

PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of September 30, 2020, there were no issuances outstanding

In addition to managing liquidity risk at the bank level, we monitor the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s contractual obligations consist primarily of debt
service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q 37  

 
 
 
 
 
parent company maintains adequate liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases and acquisitions.

As of September 30, 2020, available parent company liquidity totaled $13.8 billion. Parent company liquidity is primarily held in intercompany short-term investments, the
terms of which provide for the availability of cash in 31 days or less. Investments with longer durations may also be acquired, but if so, the related maturities are aligned with
scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity of parent company debt obligations.

The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends it receives from PNC Bank, which may be impacted by the following:

•

•

•

•

•

Bank-level capital
needs,
Laws and
regulations,
Corporate
policies,
Contractual restrictions,
and
Other
factors.

There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or
its non-bank subsidiaries. The amount available for dividend payments by PNC Bank to the parent company without prior regulatory approval was approximately $3.1 billion
at September 30, 2020. See Note 18 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these
limitations.

In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other
subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNC’s non-bank subsidiaries through the
issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. The parent company has the ability to offer up
to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of September 30, 2020, there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding.

The parent company has an effective shelf registration statement pursuant to which we can issue additional debt, equity and other capital instruments.

Parent company senior and subordinated debt outstanding totaled $10.7 billion and $9.8 billion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We have contractual obligations representing required future payments on borrowed funds, time deposits, leases, pension and postretirement benefits and purchase obligations.
See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2019 Form 10-K for more information on these future cash outflows. Additionally,
in the normal course of business we have various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We provide information on
our commitments in Note 9 Commitments in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report.

Credit Ratings
PNC’s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments and the ability to offer certain
products.

In general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality
of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied government support. A decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact
access to the capital markets and/or increase the cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition.

Capital Management
Detailed information on our capital management processes and activities, including additional information on our previous CCAR submissions and capital plans, is included
in the Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2019 Form 10-K.

We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming debt, issuing equity or other capital
instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions or repurchases, and managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.

We announced on March 16, 2020 a temporary suspension of our common stock repurchase program in conjunction with the Federal Reserve's effort to support the U.S.
economy during the pandemic, and will continue the suspension through the fourth quarter of 2020, consistent with the extension of the Federal Reserve's special capital
distribution restrictions. We repurchased $99 million of common shares in the third quarter to offset the effects of employee benefit plan-related issuances in 2020 as
permitted by guidance from the Federal Reserve.

On October 1, 2020, the PNC board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.15 per share payable on November 5, 2020.

Following completion of the 2020 CCAR/DFAST process, the Federal Reserve announced certain limitations on the capital distributions of any CCAR-participating bank
holding company (including PNC) during the third quarter of 2020. Under these limitations, PNC and other CCAR-participating firms, absent Federal Reserve approval, were
permitted to make only the following capital distributions during the third quarter of 2020:

•

•

Pay common dividends at the same per share level as paid during the second quarter of 2020, provided that the amount does not exceed the average of the firm's net
income for the four preceding calendar quarters;
Purchase common shares in an amount that equals the amount of share issuances related to expensed employee compensation;
and

• Make scheduled payments on additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital

instruments.

On September 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve extended these limitations, with minor modifications, to the fourth quarter of 2020, and it reserves the right to extend these
limitations to additional quarters, potentially in modified form.

Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Average quarterly adjusted total assets.
The Supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure, which takes into account both on balance sheet assets as well as certain off-balance sheet items,
including loan commitments and potential future exposure under derivative contracts.

As of January 1, 2020, the 2019 Tailoring Rules became effective for PNC. The most significant changes involve the election to exclude specific AOCI items from common
equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital and higher thresholds used to calculate CET1 capital deductions. Effective January 1, 2020, PNC must deduct from CET1 capital (net of
associated deferred tax liabilities) investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets to the extent such items individually
exceed 25% of the institution’s adjusted CET1 capital.

PNC’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios in 2020 are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. Under the standardized approach for
determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, past due exposures
and equity exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.

The regulatory agencies have adopted a rule permitting banks to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from implementing CECL. CECL’s estimated
impact on CET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the change in retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date
compared to the CECL ACL at transition. The estimated CECL impact is added to CET1 capital through December 31, 2021, then phased-out over the following three
years. PNC elected to

Management of our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q.

In response to the economic conditions caused by the pandemic, the Federal Reserve has adopted a final rule that revises, on a temporary basis, the calculation of
supplementary leverage exposure (the denominator of the supplementary leverage ratio) by bank holding companies to exclude the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury
securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. The rule was effective as of April 14, 2020 and will remain in effect through March 31, 2021. See additional discussion of
this rule in the Recent Regulatory Developments section of our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q.

At September 30, 2020, PNC and PNC Bank, our sole bank subsidiary, were both considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio
requirements. To qualify as “well capitalized”, PNC must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based capital and 10% for Total risk-based capital, and
PNC Bank must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital
and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%.

Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs), including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital well in excess
of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit
needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and believe that our September 30,
2020 capital levels were aligned with them.

See the Recent Regulatory Developments section of our second quarter 2020 Form 10-Q for recent developments that could have a potential impact on our Basel III capital
ratios. We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on us in the Supervision and Regulation section of
Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 18 Regulatory Matters in our 2019 Form 10-K.

Market Risk Management

See the Market Risk Management portion of the Risk Management Section in our 2019 Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding market risk.

Market Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial
conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities
and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market
interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.

Our Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our risk management policies, which are approved by management’s Asset
and Liability Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.

Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the third quarter of 2020 and 2019 follow.

In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel
interest rate environments. Table 32 reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12-month periods assuming (i) the PNC Economist’s most likely
rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates and (iii) yield curve slope flattening (a 50 basis point yield curve slope flattening between one-month and ten-year rates
superimposed on current base rates) scenario.

All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast
horizon.

When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business and the
behavior of existing on- and off-balance sheet positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and
the other interest rate scenarios presented in Tables 31 and 32. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then current
market rates.
The following graph presents the LIBOR/Swap yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward.

Table 33: Alternate Interest Rate Scenarios: One Year Forward

The third quarter 2020 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to benefit from an increase in interest rates and an upward
sloping interest rate yield curve. We believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing
interest rates and market conditions.

The planned discontinuance of the requirement that banks submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 presents risks to the financial instruments originated, held, or
serviced by PNC that use LIBOR as a reference rate. PNC holds instruments and services its instruments and instruments owned by others that may be impacted by the likely
discontinuance of LIBOR, including loans, investments, hedging products, floating-rate obligations, and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as a reference rate. The
transition from LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark will subject PNC to financial, legal, operational, and reputational risks.

PNC has established a cross functional governance structure to oversee the overall strategy for the transition from LIBOR and mitigate risks associated with the transition. A
LIBOR impact and risk assessment identified the associated risks across products, systems, models and processes. PNC is actively monitoring its overall firm-wide exposure
to LIBOR and using these results to plan transitional strategies and track progress versus these goals.

We also continue to focus our transition efforts on:

•

enhancing fallback language in new contracts and reviewing existing legal contracts/agreements to assess fallback language
impacts;

• making preparations for internal operational

readiness;

• making necessary enhancements to our infrastructure including systems, models, valuation tools and

•

processes;
developing and delivering on internal and external LIBOR cessation communication
plans;

42    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q

 
 
 
 
•

engaging with our clients, industry working groups and regulators;
and

• monitoring developments associated with LIBOR alternatives and industry practices related to LIBOR-indexed

instruments.

In the third quarter, PNC began offering conforming adjustable rate mortgages using the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) instead of LIBOR in line with FNMA and
FHLMC requirements.

See the Risk Factors section in Item IA and Risk Management Market Rate Management - Interest Rate Risk section in Item 7 disclosed in our 2019 Form 10-K for additional
information regarding the planned discontinuance of LIBOR as a reference rate.

Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk
We engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging activities. These transactions, related
hedges and the credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities. We do
not engage in proprietary trading of these products.

We use value-at-risk (VaR) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is used to estimate the probability of portfolio
losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. A diversified VaR reflects empirical correlations across different asset classes. We calculate a
diversified VaR at a 95% confidence interval and the results for the first nine months of 2020 and 2019 were within our acceptable limits.

See the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk section of our 2019 Form 10-K for more information on our models used to calculate VaR and our
backtesting process.

Customer related trading revenue was $293 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $212 million for the same period in 2019. The increase was
primarily due to higher derivative client sales revenues and the impact of changes in credit valuations for customer-related derivative activities. For the quarterly period,
customer related trading revenue was $108 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $77 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the changes
in credit valuations for customer-related derivative activities.

Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment Risk
Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits,
underwriting securities and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts,
recapitalizations and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private
equity. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets are directly affected by changes in market factors.

Various PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy
limits and associated guidelines.

Tax Credit Investments
Included in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated entities. These tax credit investment balances included
unfunded commitments totaling $.8 billion and $1.0 billion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. These unfunded commitments are included in Other
liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Form 10-K has further information on
Tax Credit Investments.

Private Equity and Other
The majority of our other equity investments consists of our private equity portfolio. The private equity portfolio is an illiquid portfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity
investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion at September 30,
2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of September 30, 2020, $1.2 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and $.2 billion was invested indirectly
through various private equity funds. See the Recent Regulatory Developments section of our second quarter 2020 Form 10-

Included in our other equity investments are Visa Class B common shares, which are recorded at cost. Visa Class B common shares that we own are transferable only under
limited circumstances until they can be converted into shares of the publicly-traded Class A common shares, which cannot happen until the resolution of the pending
interchange litigation. Based upon the September 30, 2020 per share closing price of $199.97 for a Visa Class A common share, the estimated value of our total investment in
the Class B common shares was approximately $1.1 billion at the current conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares, while our cost basis was not significant. See Note
6 Fair Value and Note 19 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2019 10-K for additional information regarding our Visa
agreements. The estimated value does not represent fair value of the Visa B common shares given the share’s limited transferability and the lack of observable transactions in
the marketplace.

We also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative
investment strategies. Net gains related to these investments were not significant at September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019.

Financial Derivatives
We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to market (primarily interest rate) and
credit risk inherent in our business activities. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities.

Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment
and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional and an underlying as specified in the contract. Therefore, cash
requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments.

Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 6 Fair Value and Note 13 Financial Derivatives in our Notes To
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Form 10-K and in Note 12 Fair Value and Note 13 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in
this Report.

Not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to
unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.

RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

Capital, Capital Planning and Liquidity
In October 2020, the federal banking agencies finalized rules implementing the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). The final rules require covered banking organizations,
including PNC and PNC Bank, to maintain an amount of available stable funding (ASF) equal to or greater than the banking organization’s projected minimum funding
needs, or required stable funding (RSF), as calculated under the rules over a one-year time horizon. Consistent with the tailoring of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio requirements,
Category III banking organizations with less than $75 billion in average weighted short-term wholesale funding, like PNC and PNC Bank, will need to meet a reduced NSFR
requirement, with RSF adjusted by a 0.85 scalar. The final rule also requires covered holding companies like PNC to publicly disclose their NSFRs and other qualitative
components of their liquidity profiles on a semi-annual basis. The final rules take effect on July 1, 2021. PNC has taken several actions to prepare for implementation of the
NSFR, and we expect to be in compliance with the NSFR requirements when they become effective.

On October 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve extended, until March 31, 2021, certain temporary actions taken to increase the availability of intraday credit extended by Federal
Reserve Banks. These actions include suspending the Federal Reserve's uncollateralized intraday credit limits (net debit caps), waiving overdraft fees for institutions that are
eligible for the primary credit program, and suspending two collections of information that are used to calculate net debit caps.

On September 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it would extend its special limitations on capital distributions by banking organizations that participated in the
2020 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, such as PNC, through the fourth quarter of 2020. These special limitations require covered banking
organizations to suspend share repurchases (except those to offset the effects of employee benefit plan-related issuances) and allows organizations to maintain their common
dividends subject to a formula based on recent income. Additionally, in September 2020, the Federal Reserve released the hypothetical supervisory scenarios to be used in the
second round of stress tests to be conducted in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the continued economic uncertainty presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Bank stress test
submissions were due on November 2, 2020, and the Federal Reserve has indicated it will publicly release the results of the tests by the end of the year.

In September 2020, the Federal Reserve requested comment on a proposal that would update the Federal Reserve’s capital planning requirements to be consistent with the
capital and liquidity tailoring rules adopted last year. In addition to changing certain assumptions about material business changes under stress, the proposal invites comment
on all aspects of the Federal Reserve’s existing capital planning guidance. Comments on the proposal are due by November 20, 2020.

In August and September 2020, the federal banking agencies adopted in final form several regulatory capital rules that were issued in interim final form earlier this year.
These rules permit banking organizations that are subject to the CECL accounting standard during 2020 to delay CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital, revise the
definition of “eligible retained income” for purposes of the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) and other Basel III capital buffers and neutralize the regulatory capital and liquidity
coverage ratio effects of participating in the Federal Reserve’s Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility and Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility. For more
information, see Item 2 Recent Regulatory Developments in our second quarter 2020 Form 10-Q.

Other Developments
In October 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a rule that determines when a national bank like PNC Bank makes a loan and is the "true
lender," including in the context of a partnership between a bank and a third party. Under the final rule, a bank is the true lender if, as of the date of origination, it is named as
the lender in the loan agreement or funds the loan.

On August 13, 2020, an interim rule adopted by the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to implement certain provisions of the John S. McCain National Defense
Authorization Act took effect. This rule prohibits the Department of Defense and all other executive branch agencies from contracting (or extending or renewing a contract)
with an entity that uses covered telecommunication equipment or services provided by certain Chinese companies as a substantial or essential part of any system. It is possible
that these restrictions may affect PNC’s ability to compete for U.S. government contracts, at least in the short-term.

In August 2020, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to create a new category of seasoned qualified mortgages
(Seasoned QMs), which are presumed to meet the ability-to-pay requirements established by the Dodd-Frank Act. To be considered a Seasoned QM under the proposal, loans
would have to be first-lien, fixed-rate mortgages that have met certain performance requirements over a 36-month seasoning period. Covered transactions would also have to
be held on the creditor’s portfolio during the seasoning period, comply with general restrictions on product features and points and fees and meet certain underwriting
requirements (including verification of the consumer’s debt-to-income ratio (DTI) or residual income at origination). The comment period for the proposal ended on October
1, 2020.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

Note 1 Accounting Policies of our 2019 Form 10-K describes the most significant accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, including
discussion of our policies for the Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit, prior to the adoption of the CECL standard.
See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report regarding the impact of new accounting pronouncements, including CECL,
that were adopted during 2020.

Certain policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions, and
such variations may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods.

The following critical accounting policies and judgments are described in more detail in Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments in Item 7 of our 2019 Form 10-K:

Allowance for Credit Losses

We maintain the ACL at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on our existing investment securities, loans,
finance leases (including residual values), other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments, for the remaining contractual term of the assets taking into
consideration expected prepayments. Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss experience, borrower characteristics, current economic conditions, reasonable
and supportable forecasts of future conditions and other relevant factors. We use methods sensitive to changes in economic conditions, to interpret these factors to estimate
expected credit losses. We evaluate and, when appropriate, enhance the quality of our data and models and other methods used to estimate ACL on an ongoing basis. We
apply qualitative factors to reflect in the ACL our best estimate of amounts that we do not expect to collect because of, among other things, idiosyncratic risk factors, changes
in economic conditions that may not be reflected in forecasted results, or other potential methodology weaknesses. The ACL estimates are therefore susceptible to various
factors, including, but not limited to, the following major factors:

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q 45  

•

•

•

Current economic conditions and borrower quality: Our forecast of expected losses depends on conditions and portfolio
quality as of the estimation date. As current conditions evolve, forecasted losses could be materially affected.
Scenario weights and design: Our loss estimates are sensitive to the shape and severity of macroeconomic forecasts and
thus
vary significantly between upside and downside scenarios. Change to probability weights assigned to these scenarios and
timing of peak business cycles reflected by the scenarios could materially affect our loss estimates.
Portfolio volume and mix: Changes to portfolio volume and mix could materially affect our estimates, as CECL
reserves
would be recognized upon origination or acquisition.

For all assets and unfunded lending related commitments within the scope of the CECL standard, the applicable ACL is composed of one or a combination of the following
components: (i) collectively assessed or pooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed reserves, and
(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our methodologies and key assumptions for each of these components are discussed in Note 1
Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report.

Reasonable and Supportable Economic Forecast
Under CECL, we are required to consider reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses. For this purpose,
we have established a framework which includes a three year reasonable and supportable economic forecast period and the use of four
economic scenarios with associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes over
our reasonable and supportable forecast period (RSFP). Our RSFP credit loss estimates are sensitive to the shape and severity of the scenarios used and weights assigned to
them.

To generate the four economic forecast scenarios we use a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of economic activity and forward-looking
expert judgment to forecast the distribution of economic outcomes over the RSFP. Each scenario is then given an associated probability (weight) in order to represent our
current expectation within that distribution over the RSFP. This process is informed by current economic conditions, expected business cycle evolution and the expert
judgment of PNC’s CECL Reserve Adequacy Committee (CECL RAC). This approach seeks to provide a reasonable representation of the forecast of expected economic
outcomes and is used to estimate expected credit losses across a variety of loans and securities. Each quarter the scenarios are presented for approval to PNC’s CECL RAC
and the committee determines and approves CECL scenarios weights for use for the current reporting period.

The scenarios used for the period ended September 30, 2020 were designed to reflect the improved macroeconomic outlook and the recovery that began in May which has
outpaced market expectations, and was our best estimate as of September 30, 2020. We used a number of economic variables in our scenarios, with the most significant
drivers being GDP and the unemployment rate measures. Using the weighted-average of our four economic forecast scenarios, we estimated at September 30, 2020 that GDP
finishes the year down 4.2% from fourth quarter 2019 levels and grows 3.8% in 2021, recovering to pre-recession peak levels by the first quarter of 2022. One of the scenarios
included in our weighted-average is our baseline prediction of the most likely economic outcome, which is further discussed in our Business Outlook and the Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information in this Financial Review, and includes estimated GDP recovering to pre-pandemic levels by late 2021. The weighted-
average unemployment rate was estimated to be 8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2020, with the labor market continuing to recover in 2021 and 2022. While the economy has
seen significant recovery with national level macroeconomic indicators outperforming market expectations, considerable uncertainty regarding overall lifetime loss content for
both our commercial and consumer portfolios remains, specifically as it relates to our customers that are less likely to benefit from the economic recovery currently
underway. For commercial borrowers, there are substantial concerns around industries that are dependent on in-person gatherings, hospitality and tourism. For consumer
borrowers, payment behavior once the CARES Act stimulus wanes is also difficult to predict but we believe the highest uncertainty is concentrated within consumer
borrowers who have been afforded accommodation as it relates to payment deferral/forbearance. As such, PNC identified and performed significant analysis around these key,
high risk segments to ensure our reserves were adequate in light of the improved economic environment. We believe that the economic assumptions used in the scenarios for
the third quarter of 2020, in combination with increased reserves for borrowers in segments most adversely impacted by the pandemic, sufficiently reflect the life of loan
losses in the current portfolio.

For internal analytical purposes, we considered what our capital ratios would be if we had an ACL at December 31, 2020 equal to the Federal Reserve's estimated nine quarter
credit losses for PNC under the 2020 CCAR supervisory severely adverse scenario of $12.1 billion, increasing the reserves by approximately $5.6 billion over the next
quarter. This analysis resulted in a CET1 ratio of approximately 10.5% at December 31, 2020, a level well above 7.0%, which is our regulatory minimum of 4.5% plus our
Stress Capital Buffer of 2.5%. This scenario was not our expectation at September 30, 2020 and does not reflect our current expectation, nor does it capture all the potential
unknown variables that would likely arise through the remainder of 2020, but it provides an approximation of a possible outcome under hypothetical severe conditions. The
CECL methodology inherently requires a high degree of judgment. As a result, it is possible that we may, at another point in time, reach different conclusions regarding our
credit loss estimates.

INTERNAL CONTROLS AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As of September 30, 2020, we performed an evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and
of changes in our internal control over financial reporting.

Based on that evaluation, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective as of September 30, 2020, and that there has been no change
in PNC’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

We also make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and
liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial position, and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations that are forward-
looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,”
“plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “see,” “look,” “intend,” “outlook,” “project,” “forecast,” “estimate,” “goal,” “will,” “should” and other similar words and expressions.

Forward-looking statements are necessarily subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Future events or circumstances may change
our outlook and may also affect the nature of the assumptions, risks and uncertainties to which our forward-looking statements are subject. Forward-looking statements speak
only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty and do not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly
materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance. As a result, we caution against placing undue reliance on any
forward-looking statements.

•

Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are
currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies. These statements are based on our view that:

–

The U.S. economy is in a nascent economic recovery in the second half of 2020, following a very severe but very short economic contraction in the first half
of the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures to contain it. Real GDP declined significantly in the first and second quarters of
2020, as many firms closed, at least temporarily, and consumers stayed at home. Since the late spring/early summer, economic activity has picked up due to
loosening restrictions on businesses, massive federal stimulus, and extremely low interest rates. Between May and September the economy added back
slightly more than half of the 22 million jobs lost in March and April.

– Despite the improvement in the economy in recent months, economic activity remains far below its pre-pandemic level and unemployment remains

elevated. Real GDP growth in the third quarter was extremely strong, at an annual rate of 33.1%, but will slow in the fourth quarter and through 2021. PNC
does not expect real GDP to return to its pre-pandemic level until late 2021, and does not expect employment to return to its pre-pandemic level until 2023.
Risks to this outlook are weighted to the downside; they include a further resurgence in the spread of the coronavirus and a lack of additional stimulus from
the federal government.

– Monetary policy remains extremely supportive of economic growth. PNC expects the Federal Open Market Committee to keep the federal funds rate in its

current range of 0.00% to 0.25% through at least mid-2024.

•

Given the many unknowns and risks being heavily weighted to the downside, our forward-looking statements are subject to the risk that conditions will be
substantially different than we are currently expecting. If efforts to contain COVID-19 are unsuccessful and restrictions on businesses and activities are not further
lifted or are reimposed, the recovery would be much weaker. There is even the potential that the economy could fall back into recession. PNC's baseline scenario
assumes additional fiscal stimulus; continued inaction on stimulus is another major downside risk. The longer it takes to combat the pandemic, the more permanent
damage it will cause to business and consumer fundamentals and sentiment; this could make the recovery weaker and result in permanently lower long-run economic
growth. An extended global recession due to COVID-19 would weaken the U.S. recovery. As a result, the outbreak and its consequences, including responsive
measures to manage it, have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect, possibly materially, on our business and financial performance by adversely
affecting the demand and profitability of our products and services, the valuation of assets and our ability to meet the needs of our customers.

PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding a stress capital buffer established by
the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board's CCAR process. The Federal Reserve also has imposed additional limitations on capital
distributions through the fourth quarter of 2020 by CCAR-participating bank holding companies and may extend these limitations, potentially in modified form.
PNC’s regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the company’s financial performance, the scope and terms of final capital
regulations then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of PNC’s balance sheet. In addition, PNC’s ability to determine, evaluate and forecast
regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the
development, validation and regulatory review of related models.
Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position,
reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding,
and ability to attract and retain management. These developments could include:

–

Changes to laws and regulations, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, consumer protection, bank capital and liquidity
standards, pension, bankruptcy and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles.

– Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. These matters may

result in monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional
expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to PNC.
Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental
agencies.
Impact on business and operating results of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our
intellectual property protection in general.

–

–

Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through
effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity
standards.

• We grow our business in part through acquisitions and new strategic initiatives. Risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired

and strategic initiative, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our
inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, and the integration of the
acquired businesses into PNC after closing.
Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and
revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.
Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist activities, system failures, security
breaches, cyberattacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties specifically.

Factors and Risk Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in these reports. In particular,
our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting governmental and societal responses. Our forward-
looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those we may discuss elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC.
