FINANCIAL REVIEW
THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

This Financial Review, including the Consolidated Financial Highlights, should be read together with our unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and unaudited Statistical Information included
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Report or Form 10-Q) and with Items 6, 7, 8 and 9A of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K (2020 Form 10-K). We have reclassified certain prior
period amounts to conform with the current period presentation, which we believe is more meaningful to readers of our consolidated financial statements. For information regarding certain business,
regulatory and legal risks, see the following: the Risk Management section of this Financial Review and of Item 7 in our 2020 Form 10-K; Item 1A Risk Factors included in our 2020 Form 10-K; and the
Commitments and Legal Proceedings Notes of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report and Item 8 of our 2020 Form 10-K. Also, see the Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section in this Financial Review and in our 2020 Form 10-K for certain other
factors that could cause actual results or future events to differ, perhaps materially, from historical performance and from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this Report. See Note
14 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for a reconciliation of total business segment earnings to total PNC consolidated net income as reported on a
GAAP basis. In this Report, “PNC”, “we” or “us” refers to The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (except when referring to PNC as a public company, its
common stock or other securities issued by PNC, which just refer to The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.). References to The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. or to any of its subsidiaries are
specifically made where applicable.

The Executive Summary and Consolidated Income Statement Review portions of this Financial Review section provide information regarding items impacting the comparability of the periods presented.

(a)
(b) Dividends are payable quarterly other than Series O, Series R and Series S preferred stock, which are payable semiannually, with the Series O payable in different quarters than the Series R and Series S preferred stock. Beginning on August 1, dividends

will be paid on the Series O on a quarterly basis (February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 of each year).
The effective income tax rates are generally lower than the statutory rate due to the relationship of pretax income to tax credits and earnings that are not subject to tax.

(c)
(d) Net interest margin is the total yield on interest-earning assets minus the total rate on interest-bearing liabilities and includes the benefit from use of noninterest-bearing sources. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margins, we use
net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields used in the calculation of net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable
investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP in the Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, see Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (Non-GAAP) in the Statistical Information (Unaudited)
section in Item 1 of this Report.

Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review and the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of our 2020 Form 10-K.

Acquisition of BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc.

On June 1, 2021, we acquired BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc. (BBVA) for cash consideration of $11.5 billion. BBVA, a U.S. financial holding company conducting its business
operations primarily through its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA USA, operates more than 600 branches in Texas, Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Colorado and New
Mexico. Our results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 reflect BBVA's operations for the month of June 2021 and our June 30, 2021 balance sheet includes
BBVA's balances, including $95.7 billion of total assets, $82.2 billion of deposits and $60.5 billion of loans.

Shortly after the acquisition, PNC merged BBVA into PNC, and PNC contributed all of the shares of BBVA USA to PNC
Bancorp, Inc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PNC. As a result, BBVA USA is now a subsidiary of PNC Bancorp, Inc. and an affiliate of PNC Bank. PNC expects to merge
BBVA USA into PNC Bank in October 2021.

Throughout this Report, BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc. will be referred to as BBVA.

Discontinued Operations

In the second quarter of 2020, we divested our entire 22.4% equity investment in BlackRock. Net proceeds from the sale were
$14.2 billion with an after-tax gain on sale of $4.3 billion. BlackRock's historical results are reported as discontinued operations. For additional details on the divestiture of our
equity investment in BlackRock, see Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Report.

Income Statement Highlights

Net income from continuing operations of $1.1 billion, or $2.43 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2021 increased $1.8 billion compared to a net loss from
continuing operations of $0.7 billion, or $1.90 loss per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to a lower provision for credit losses.

•

For the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020:
Total revenue increased $591 million, or 14%, to $4.7 billion.

•

•

Net interest income of $2.6 billion, including $236 million from BBVA, increased $54 million, or 2%.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q 3  

•

Net interest margin decreased 23 basis points to 2.29% reflecting higher average balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank.

•

Noninterest income increased $537 million, or 35%, to $2.1 billion, including $80 million from BBVA, primarily due to higher corporate and
consumer services fee income as well as higher other noninterest income.

•

•

Provision for credit losses was $302 million for the second quarter of 2021, as a provision recapture of $704 million, primarily driven by improvements in credit
quality and macroeconomic factors, as well as balance reductions, was more than offset by an initial provision for credit losses of $1.0 billion related to the
BBVA acquisition. Provision for credit losses was $2.5 billion for the second quarter of 2020.
Noninterest expense increased $535 million, or 21%, to $3.1 billion, due to $179 million of BBVA operating expenses, $101 million of integration expenses,
growth in business and marketing activity and additions to legal reserves during the second quarter of 2021.

For additional detail, see the Consolidated Income Statement Review section of this Financial Review.

Balance Sheet Highlights

Our balance sheet was strong and well positioned at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. In comparison to December 31, 2020, changes in our balance sheet were primarily
driven by the BBVA acquisition.

•
•

•
•

•
•

Total assets increased $87.5 billion, or 19%, to $554.2 billion, including $95.7 billion from BBVA.
Total loans increased $52.8 billion, or 22%, to $294.7 billion, including $60.5 billion from BBVA.

•

•

Total commercial loans increased $32.4 billion, or 19%, to $199.6 billion driven by BBVA loans of $38.5 billion, partially offset by PNC legacy PPP loan
forgiveness and lower multifamily agency warehouse lending.

•

At June 30, 2021, PNC had $11.6 billion of PPP loans and included $2.1 billion from BBVA. PPP loans outstanding at December 31, 2020 were
$12.0 billion.

Total consumer loans increased $20.3 billion, or 27%, to $95.1 billion driven by loans from BBVA of $22.0 billion and increased originations of PNC legacy
residential mortgages, partially offset by declines in remaining PNC legacy portfolios as paydowns outpaced new originations.

Investment securities increased $37.7 billion, or 43%, to $126.5 billion, resulting from $17.6 in securities from BBVA and increased purchase activity.
Interest-earning deposits with banks, primarily with the Federal Reserve Bank, decreased $12.7 billion to $72.4 billion, primarily due to the payment of $11.5 billion in
cash for the purchase of BBVA and increased securities purchases, partially offset by $12.0 billion from BBVA.
Total deposits increased $87.5 billion, or 24%, to $452.9 billion, including $82.2 billion from BBVA, due to growth in commercial and consumer deposits.
Borrowed funds decreased $2.4 billion, or 6%, to $34.8 billion, due to lower FHLB borrowings reflecting the use of liquidity from deposit growth, partially offset by
$2.3 billion from BBVA.

For additional detail, see the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review.

Credit Quality Highlights

Second quarter 2021 credit quality performance included the acquisition of BBVA and the associated purchase accounting impacts.

•

At June 30, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020:

•

•

•

Nonperforming assets of $2.8 billion, increased $481 million, or 21%, due to $880 million of nonperforming assets from BBVA, partially offset by lower PNC
legacy nonperforming assets reflecting improved credit performance.
Overall loan delinquencies of $1.3 billion decreased $73 million, or 5%, driven by lower PNC legacy consumer and commercial delinquencies, partially offset
by $291 million in delinquencies resulting from the BBVA acquisition.
The ACL related to loans increased to $6.4 billion, or 2.16% of total loans, at June 30, 2021 compared to $5.9 billion, or 2.46% of total loans, at December 31,
2020. The increase was attributable to the ACL associated with the BBVA portfolio, which was recognized through both a fair value purchase accounting mark
of $1.2 billion and an initial provision for credit losses of $1.0 billion, partially offset by a provision recapture of $1.3 billion and net loan charge-offs of $0.5
billion.

•

Net charge-offs were $306 million, or 0.48% of average loans on an annualized basis, in the second quarter of 2021. This included $248 million related to BBVA, which
were largely the result of required purchase accounting treatment for the acquisition. Net charge-offs were $236 million, or 0.35%, for the same quarter of 2020.

For additional detail see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review.

4    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q

Capital Highlights
We maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions.

•

Our CET1 ratio decreased to 10.1% at June 30, 2021 from 12.2% at December 31, 2020, primarily due to the BBVA acquisition.

•

Capital was impacted by our election of a five-year transition period for CECL's estimated impact on CET1         capital. CECL's estimated impact on CET1
capital is defined as the change in retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date, excluding the initial
allowance for PCD loans from BBVA, compared to CECL ACL at transition. The estimated CECL impact is added to CET1 capital through December 31,
2021, then phased-out over the following three years.

•
•

•

•

Common shareholders' equity increased to $51.1 billion at June 30, 2021, compared to $50.5 billion at December 31, 2020.
In the second quarter, we returned capital to shareholders through dividends on common shares of $0.5 billion and refrained from repurchasing shares through the
second quarter of 2021 due to the BBVA transaction.
During the second quarter, PNC announced the reinstatement of share repurchase programs with repurchases of up to $2.9 billion for the four-quarter period beginning in
the third quarter of 2021.
On July 1, 2021, the PNC Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to $1.25 per share, an increase of 10 cents per share, or 9%, effective
with the August 5, 2021 dividend payment.

See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for more detail on our 2021 liquidity and capital actions as well as
our capital ratios.

PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding a stress capital buffer established by the Federal
Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board's CCAR process. For additional information, see Capital Management in the Risk Management section in this
Financial Review and the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2020 Form 10-K.

Business Outlook

Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently
expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies. These statements are based on our views, as follows:

•

The U.S. economy is in an economic recovery, following a very severe but very short economic contraction in the first half of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and
public health measures to contain it.

• With passage of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and continued vaccine distribution, economic growth has picked up in 2021 and will remain very strong through
the rest of this year and into 2022. Real GDP returned to its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter of 2021. Employment in June 2021 was still down by 6.8 million
from before the pandemic; PNC expects employment to return to its pre-pandemic level in the spring of 2022.
Compared to the spring of 2020 (when prices were falling), inflation has accelerated in mid-2021 due to strong demand in specific segments and supply chain
disruptions. Inflation will slow in the second half of 2021.
PNC expects the FOMC to keep the fed funds rate in its current range of 0.00% to 0.25% until mid-2023.

•

•

For the third quarter of 2021, compared to the second quarter of 2021 where appropriate, we expect:

•
•
•
•
•
•

Period-end loans to be up modestly,
Net interest income to be up in the mid-teens, on a percentage basis,
Fee income to be up mid-single digits, on a percentage basis,
Other noninterest income to be between $325 million and $375 million,
Noninterest expense excluding integration expense to be up high-single digits, on a percentage basis, and
Net loan charge-offs to be between $150 million and $200 million.

For the full year 2021, compared to full year 2020 except as noted, we expect:

•
•
•
•

Period-end loans to be up modestly from June 30, 2021,
Revenue to be up approximately 12% to 14%,
Noninterest expense excluding integration expense to be up approximately 13% to 15%, and
The effective tax rate to be 17%.

Additionally, we are on track to realize $900 million in net expense savings of BBVA's expense base in 2022. We also expect to incur nonrecurring merger and integration costs
of approximately $980 million; the majority of which we expect to recognize in 2021.

See the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2020 Form 10-K for other factors that
could cause future events to differ, perhaps materially, from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.

CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW

Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.

Net income from continuing operations of $1.1 billion, or $2.43 per diluted common share for the second quarter of 2021, increased $1.8 billion compared to a net loss from
continuing operations of $0.7 billion, or $1.90 loss per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2020. For the first six months of 2021, net income from continuing
operations was $2.9 billion, or $6.54 per diluted common share, compared to $15 million, or $0.29 loss per diluted common share, for the first six months of 2020. In both
comparisons the increase was primarily due to a lower provision for credit losses in 2021 due to improvements in credit quality and macroeconomic factors.

Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as well as net interest margins, we use interest income on
a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This
adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement. For more information, see Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (Non-GAAP) in the Statistical Information (Unaudited)
section in Item 1 of this Report.

Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and
related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis
section of this Report for additional information.

Net interest income increased $54 million, or 2%, for the second quarter of 2021, and decreased $109 million, or 2%, for the first six months of 2021 compared to the same
periods in 2020. In the quarterly comparison, the increase was due to interest earning assets from the BBVA acquisition and lower rates on deposits, partially offset by lower
PNC legacy loans outstanding and securities yields. In the year-to-date comparison, the decrease was due to lower PNC legacy loans outstanding and lower securities yields,
partially offset by lower deposit rates and interest earning assets from BBVA.

Net interest margin in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons decreased 23 basis points and 39 basis points, respectively. The decrease in both comparisons reflected higher
balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank and lower yields on securities, partially offset by the impact of BBVA's interest earning assets.

Average investment securities increased $20.1 billion, or 23%, and $11.1 billion, or 13%, in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, respectively. Both comparisons
increased primarily due to higher U.S. Treasury and government securities, resulting from increased purchase activity and the acquisition of BBVA. Average investment
securities represented 24% of average interest-earning assets for the second quarter of 2021 and 22% for the first six months of 2021, compared to 22% and 23% for the same
periods in 2020.

Average loans decreased $12.5 billion, or 5%, and $8.9 billion, or 3% in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, respectively. In the quarterly comparison, the decrease was
due to lower utilization of loan commitments by commercial customers. In the year-to-date comparison, the decrease was due to lower commercial and consumer loans. The
decrease in both comparisons was partially offset by loans from the BBVA acquisition. Average loans represented 57% of average interest-earning assets for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2021, compared to 67% and 68% for the same periods in 2020.

Average interest-earning deposits with banks increased $43.9 billion and $55.9 billion in the respective quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, as average balances held with
the Federal Reserve Bank increased due to higher deposits.

Average interest-bearing deposits grew $28.0 billion, or 12%, and $32.4 billion, or 14% in the respective quarterly and year-to-date comparisons due to overall growth in
commercial and consumer liquidity, including deposits from BBVA. In total, average interest-bearing deposits increased to 89% and 88% of average interest-bearing liabilities
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to 82% and 81% for the same periods in 2020.

Average borrowed funds decreased $19.1 billion, or 36%, compared with the second quarter of 2020 and $20.5 billion, or 37%, compared with the first six months of 2020
primarily due to a decline in FHLB borrowings reflecting the use of liquidity from deposit growth.

Further details regarding average loans and deposits are included in the Business Segments Review section of this Financial Review.

Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 45% for both the second quarter and first six months of 2021, compared to 38% and 40% for the same periods in 2020.

Asset management revenue increased in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons due to the impact of higher average equity markets. PNC's discretionary client assets under
management increased to $183 billion at June 30, 2021 from $151 billion at June 30, 2020, primarily driven by higher spot equity markets.

Consumer services revenue increased in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons reflecting the impacts of higher consumer spending on debit card, merchant services, and
credit card fees and higher average equity markets on brokerage fees.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q 7  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Corporate services revenue increased in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory fees, treasury management product
revenue, revenue from commercial mortgage servicing activities and loan commitment fees.

Residential mortgage revenue decreased in the quarterly comparison primarily due to lower servicing fee revenue and decreased in the year-to-date comparison due to both
lower mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge and lower servicing fee revenue. Servicing fee revenue in both comparisons declined due to higher MSR
amortization.

Service charges on deposits increased in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons primarily due to higher transaction volumes and fewer pandemic related fee waivers.

Other noninterest income increased in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons primarily due to higher private equity revenue.

The increase in noninterest expense in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons reflected BBVA operating and integration expenses, growth in business and marketing activity
and additions to legal reserves during the second quarter of 2021.

Effective Income Tax Rate

The effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 16.1% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 17.5% in the second quarter of 2020, and 16.6% in the first six
months of 2021 compared to 165.2% in the same period in 2020.

Our balance sheet was strong and well positioned at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

•

•

•

Total asset growth reflected the addition of loans and investment securities from the BBVA acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in interest-earning deposits with
banks.
Total liabilities increased primarily due to deposit growth reflecting higher commercial and consumer deposits driven by the acquisition of BBVA, partially offset by
lower borrowed funds.
Total equity increased primarily due to second quarter net income, partially offset by lower AOCI and dividends paid on common and preferred stock.

The ACL related to loans totaled $6.4 billion at June 30, 2021, an increase of $0.4 billion since December 31, 2020. The increase was attributable to the ACL associated with
the BBVA portfolio, which was recognized through both a fair value purchase accounting mark of $1.2 billion and an initial provision for credit losses of $1.0 billion, partially
offset by a provision recapture of $1.3 billion and net loan charge-offs of $0.5 billion. See the following for additional information regarding our ACL related to loans:

Commercial loans increased driven by $38.5 billion of BBVA loans, partially offset by PNC legacy PPP loan forgiveness and lower multifamily agency warehouse lending. At
June 30, 2021, PNC had $11.6 billion of PPP loans outstanding which included $2.1 billion from BBVA. PPP loans outstanding at December 31, 2020 were $12.0 billion.

For commercial and industrial loans by industry and commercial real estate loans by geography and property type, see Loan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis in the Credit
Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review.

Consumer loans increased primarily due to $22.0 billion of loans from BBVA and increased originations of PNC legacy residential mortgages, partially offset by declines in the
remaining PNC legacy portfolios as paydowns outpaced new originations.

For information on our residential real estate and home equity portfolios, including loans by geography, and our auto loan portfolio, see Loan Portfolio Characteristics and
Analysis in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Financial Review.

For additional information regarding our loan portfolio see Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included
in this Report.

Investment Securities

Investment securities of $126.5 billion at June 30, 2021, increased $37.7 billion, or 43%, compared to December 31, 2020, resulting from the $17.6 billion related to the BBVA
acquisition and increased purchase activity.

The level and composition of the investment securities portfolio fluctuates over time based on many factors including market conditions, loan and deposit growth, and balance
sheet management activities. We manage our investment securities portfolio to optimize returns, while providing a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other
activities, considering the LCR and other internal and external guidelines and constraints.

Table 8 presents the distribution of our total investment securities portfolio by amortized cost and fair value, as well as by credit rating. We have included credit ratings
information because we believe that the information is an indicator of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. Changes in credit ratings classifications could indicate
increased or decreased credit risk and could be accompanied by a reduction or increase in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio. We continually monitor the credit
risk in our portfolio and maintain the allowance for investment securities at an appropriate level to absorb expected credit losses on our investment securities portfolio for the
remaining contractual term of the securities adjusted for expected prepayments. See Note 3 Investment Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 1 of this Report for additional details regarding the amount of the allowance for investment securities.

The duration of investment securities was 4 years at June 30, 2021. We estimate that at June 30, 2021 the effective duration of investment securities was 4.1 years for an
immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 3.8 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates.

Based on expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio was 4.4 years at June 30, 2021 compared to 3.4 years at
December 31, 2020.

Total deposits increased reflecting growth in commercial and consumer deposits primarily due to the BBVA acquisition.

Borrowed funds decreased due to lower FHLB borrowings reflecting the use of liquidity from deposit growth, which more than offset borrowed funds from BBVA.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q 11  

 
 
 
 
The level and composition of borrowed funds fluctuates over time based on many factors including market conditions, loan, investment securities and deposit growth, and
capital considerations. We manage our borrowed funds to provide a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering our LCR requirements and other
internal and external guidelines and constraints.

See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for additional information regarding our 2021 liquidity and capital
activities. See Note 10 Borrowed Funds in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2020 Form 10-K for additional information related to our
borrowings.

Shareholders’ Equity

Total shareholders’ equity was $54.6 billion at June 30, 2021, an increase of $0.6 billion compared to December 31, 2020. The increase resulted from net income of $2.9
billion, partially offset by lower AOCI of $1.3 billion reflecting the impact of higher rates on net unrealized securities gains and common and preferred stock dividends of $1.0
billion.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEW

We have three reportable business segments:

•
•
•

Retail Banking
Corporate & Institutional Banking
Asset Management Group

Business segment results and a description of each business are included in Note 14 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of
this Report. Certain amounts included in this Business Segments Review differ from those amounts shown in Note 14, primarily due to the presentation in this Financial Review
of business net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.

Our business segment results for the first six months of 2021 reflect BBVA's business operations for the month of June 2021 and our balance sheet at June 30, 2021 includes
BBVA's balances. Until conversion of bank systems and branches, PNC Bank and BBVA customers will continue to be served through their respective PNC Bank and BBVA
USA branches, websites and mobile apps, financial advisors and relationship managers. Upon conversion, which is expected to occur in October 2021, there will be changes in
the segmentation of BBVA USA customers as we integrate data to PNC applications, finalize the review of customer relationships and better align customers with PNC's
products and services. See Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report for additional
information on the acquisition of BBVA.

During the second quarter of 2020, we divested our entire 22.4% investment in BlackRock, which had previously been reported as a separate business segment. See Note 2
Acquisition and Divestiture Activity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report for additional information.

Net interest income in business segment results reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a
funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other factors.

Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in the “Other” category as shown in Table 83 in
Note 14 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the
criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses, ACL for investment securities,
certain trading activities, certain runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments, intercompany eliminations, certain corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are
not allocated to business segments, exited businesses and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP).

Retail Banking

Retail Banking's core strategy is to help all of our consumer and small business customers move financially forward. We aim to grow our primary checking and transaction
relationships through strong acquisition and retention. We seek to deepen relationships by meeting the broad range of our customers’ financial needs with savings, liquidity,
lending, investment and retirement solutions. A strategic priority for us is to differentiate the customer experience, leveraging technology to make banking easier for our
customers. A key element of our strategy is to expand the use of lower-cost alternative distribution channels, with an emphasis on digital capabilities, while continuing to
optimize the traditional branch network. In addition, we are focused on consistently engaging both our employees and customers, which is a strong driver of customer growth,
retention and relationship expansion.

Retail Banking earnings for the first six months of 2021 increased $861 million compared with the same period in 2020 driven by a provision recapture, partially offset by higher
noninterest expense. Results for the first six months of 2021 include the impact of BBVA's business operations for the month of June 2021. Retail banking added $26.2 billion in
loans and $41.4 billion in deposits at June 30, 2021 attributable to the acquisition, along with 647 branches and 824 ATMs.

Net interest income was $2.9 billion, including $143 million from BBVA, and increased primarily due to growth in average deposit balances, partially offset by narrower
interest rate spreads on the value of deposits and loans, as well as declines in average loan balances.

Noninterest income was $1.4 billion, including $35 million from BBVA, and decreased largely due to declines in residential mortgage revenue, driven by lower revenue from
residential mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge and servicing fees primarily due to higher payoffs. The decrease in noninterest income was partially
offset by increased consumer services revenue driven by debit card, brokerage fees, and credit card, as well as the favorable impact of derivative fair value adjustments related to
Visa Class B common shares in the first half of 2021 compared to unfavorable adjustments in the same period of 2020.

14    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q

  
  
 
Provision recapture in the first six months of 2021 was driven by improvements in credit quality and macroeconomic factors, coupled with lower loans outstanding, partially
offset by the initial provision for credit losses of $500 million related to the BBVA acquisition.

Noninterest expense was $3.2 billion, including $111 million related to BBVA, and increased primarily as a result of higher non-credit losses due to additions to litigation
reserves, technology investments, personnel, and customer related transaction costs.

The deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances, executing on market-specific
deposit growth strategies and providing a source of low-cost funding and liquidity to PNC. In the first six months of 2021, average total deposits increased compared to the
same period in 2020 primarily driven by growth in demand and savings deposits which benefited from the impact of government stimulus payments.

Retail Banking average total loans decreased in the first six months of 2021 compared with the same period in 2020:

•
•

•
•
•
•
•

Average auto loan balances declined due to impacts of the pandemic on the auto industry and proactive credit tightening.
Average credit card balances decreased due to credit tightening actions taken as a result of the pandemic combined with changes in customer behavior resulting in higher
balance paydowns driven by government stimulus payments.
Average home equity loans decreased as paydowns and payoffs exceeded new originated volume.
Average other consumer loans declined driven by lower originations due to the pandemic and the effects of government stimulus and credit tightening.
Average education loans decreased driven by a decline in the runoff portfolio of government guaranteed education loans.
Average commercial loans increased primarily due to PPP loans.
Average residential real estate loans increased due to originations outpacing paydowns.

Our national expansion strategy is designed to grow customers with digitally-led banking and a thin branch network in markets outside of our existing retail branch network. In
2018, we began offering our digital high yield savings deposit product and opened our first solution center in Kansas City, Kansas. Solution centers are an emerging branch
operating model with a distinctive layout, where routine transactions are supported through a combination of technology and skilled banker assistance to create personalized
experiences. The primary focus of the solution center is to bring a community element to our digital banking capabilities. The solution center provides a collaborative
environment that connects our customers with our digital solutions and services, beyond deposits and withdrawals. In 2020, we expanded into three new markets, Boston,
Houston and Nashville and opened seventeen new solution centers. In the first six months of 2021 we opened eight new solution centers and expanded into two new markets,
Denver and Phoenix. In total, we have thirty open solution centers within the markets of Boston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Houston, Kansas City, Nashville and Phoenix. We
also offer digital unsecured installment and small business loans in the expansion markets. As a result of the BBVA acquisition, as of June 2021 we have become a coast-to-
coast Retail Bank.

Retail Banking continues to enhance the customer experience with refinements to product and service offerings that drive value for consumers and small businesses. We are
focused on meeting the financial needs of our customers by providing a broad range of liquidity, banking and investment products. In April 2021, we announced our Low Cash
Mode
 Virtual Wallet  feature which will give all Virtual Wallet  customers the ability to avoid unnecessary overdraft fees through real-time intelligent alerts, extra time to
prevent or address overdrafts, and controls to choose whether to return certain debits rather than the bank making the decision. Through the end of July we have successfully
rolled out Low Cash Mode

Retail Banking continued to execute on its strategy of transforming the customer experience through transaction channel migration, branch network and home lending process
transformations and multi-channel engagement and service strategies. We are also continually assessing our current branch network for optimization opportunities as usage of
alternative channels has increased and as a result have closed 95 legacy PNC branches in the first six months of 2021 consistent with our plan.

Approximately 80% of consumer customers used non-teller channels for the majority of their transactions in the first six months of 2021 compared with 72% in 2020, in
part reflecting consumer transaction behavior changes during the pandemic.
Deposit transactions via ATM and mobile channels increased to 66% of total deposit transactions in the first six months of 2021 from 61% in 2020, in part reflecting
consumer transaction behavior changes during the pandemic.

(e) Amounts are reported in corporate service fees.
(f) As of June 30.

Corporate & Institutional Banking earnings in the first six months of 2021 increased $1.9 billion compared with the same period in 2020 driven by a provision recapture and
higher total revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Results for the first six months of 2021 include the impact of BBVA's business operations for the month of
June 2021. Corporate & Institutional Banking added $30.6 billion in loans and $32.8 billion in deposits at June 30, 2021 attributable to the acquisition.

Net interest income, including $99 million from BBVA, increased in the comparison primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of loans and higher average
deposit balances, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of deposits and lower average loan balances.

Growth in noninterest income, including $35 million from BBVA, in the comparison reflected broad-based increases in treasury management product revenue, capital markets-
related revenue and revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities.

Provision recapture in the first six months of 2021 was driven by improvements in credit quality and macroeconomic factors, coupled with lower loans outstanding, partially
offset by the initial provision for credit losses of $462 million related to the BBVA acquisition.

Nonperforming assets at June 30, 2021 increased over the comparative period of 2020 primarily due to $763 million of nonperforming assets from BBVA.

Noninterest expense, including $55 million from BBVA, increased in the comparison largely due to higher variable costs associated with increased business activity.

Average loans decreased compared with the six months ended June 30, 2020 due to declines in Corporate Banking and Business Credit, partially offset by increases in
Commercial Banking and Real Estate:

•

•

•

•

Corporate Banking provides lending, equipment finance, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to mid-sized and large corporations, and
government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business declined reflecting lower average utilization of loan commitments, partially offset by new
production and loans from BBVA.
Business Credit provides asset-based lending and equipment financing solutions. The loan and lease portfolio is relatively high yielding, with acceptable risk as the loans
are mainly secured by marketable collateral. Average loans for this business declined primarily driven by lower average utilization of loan commitments, partially offset
by new production and loans from BBVA.
Commercial Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to smaller corporations and businesses. Average loans for
this business increased primarily driven by PPP loan originations and loans from BBVA, partially offset by softer new production and lower average utilization of loan
commitments.
Real Estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Average loans for this business increased reflecting
loans from BBVA, mostly offset by lower commercial mortgage and multifamily agency warehouse lending.

The deposit strategy of Corporate & Institutional Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances over time,
executing on customer and segment-specific deposit growth strategies and continuing to provide funding and liquidity to PNC. Average total deposits increased in the
comparison reflecting customers maintaining liquidity due to the economic impacts of the pandemic. We continue to actively monitor the interest rate environment and make
adjustments in response to evolving market conditions, bank funding needs and client relationship dynamics.

Corporate & Institutional Banking continues to expand its Corporate Banking business, focused on the middle market and larger sectors. We executed on our expansion plans
into the Seattle and Portland markets in 2020, and in 2021, the BBVA acquisition accelerated our expansion efforts across the Southwest, however this has not changed our
strategy regarding our de novo expansion efforts. This follows offices opened in Boston and Phoenix in 2019, Denver, Houston and Nashville in 2018, and Dallas, Kansas City
and Minneapolis in 2017. These locations complement Corporate & Institutional Banking national businesses with a significant presence in these cities and build on past

locations.

Product Revenue
In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury management, capital markets-
related products and services and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services
is included in net interest income, corporate service fees and other noninterest income. From a business perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these
services is reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses. The Other Information section in
Table 12 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for these services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows.

The Treasury Management business provides corporations with cash and investment management services, receivables and disbursement management services, funds transfer
services, international payment services and access to online/mobile information management and reporting services. Within Treasury Management, PNC Global Transfers
(formerly BBVA Transfer Services, Inc.) provides wholesale money transfer processing capabilities throughout Mexico, Central America, South America and the Caribbean.
Treasury management revenue is reported in noninterest income and net interest income. Noninterest income includes treasury management product revenue less earnings
credits provided to customers on compensating deposit balances used to pay for products and services. Net interest income primarily includes revenue from all treasury
management customer deposit balances. Compared with the first six months of 2020, treasury management revenue increased due to higher deposit balances and higher
noninterest income, including $25 million from BBVA, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of deposits.

Capital markets-related products and services include foreign exchange, derivatives, fixed income, securities underwriting, loan syndications, mergers and acquisitions advisory
and equity capital markets advisory related services. The increase in capital markets-related revenue in the comparison was primarily driven by higher merger and acquisition
advisory fees, revenue from credit valuations on customer-related derivatives activities and equity capital market advisory fees. These increases were partially offset by lower
customer-related derivative fees.

Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (both net interest income and noninterest income) and revenue derived
from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related hedges. Total revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities increased in the comparison primarily due to
higher commercial mortgage servicing income.

Asset Management Group earnings in the first six months of 2021 increased $104 million compared with the same period in 2020 driven by higher revenue, lower noninterest
expense and lower provision for credit losses. Results for the first six months of 2021 include the impact of BBVA's business operations for the month of June 2021. Asset
Management Group added $3.7 billion in loans and $8.7 billion in deposits at June 30, 2021 attributable to the acquisition.

Net interest income, including $21 million from BBVA, increased due to growth in average loan and deposit balances, wider interest rate spreads on loans and purchase
accounting impacts. This was partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on deposits.

The increase in noninterest income, including $6 million from BBVA, was primarily attributable to increases in the average equity markets.

Noninterest expense, including $10 million from BBVA, declined due to intangible asset amortization run-off and lower costs associated with decreased business travel.

Provision for credit losses in the first six months of 2021 was driven by an initial provision for credit losses of $45 million related to the acquisition of BBVA, partially offset by
improvements in credit quality and macroeconomic factors.

Discretionary client assets under management, including $4.6 billion from BBVA, increased in comparison to the prior year primarily due to the higher equity markets as of
June 30, 2021.

The Asset Management Group strives to be the leading relationship-based provider of investment, planning, banking and fiduciary services to wealthy individuals and
institutions by proactively delivering value-added ideas, solutions and exceptional service.

With the inclusion of BBVA, Personal Wealth Management has approximately 100 offices operating in eight out of the ten most affluent states in the U.S. with a majority co-
located with retail banking branches. The business provides customized investments, planning, trust and estate administration and private banking solutions to affluent
individuals and ultra-affluent families.

Institutional Asset Management provides outsourced chief investment officer, custody, private real estate, cash and fixed income client solutions, and retirement plan fiduciary
investment services to institutional clients including corporations, healthcare systems, insurance companies, unions, municipalities and non-profits.

We expect that the BBVA acquisition will continue to allow meaningful opportunities to grow the Asset Management Group segment by entering into new markets for both the
Personal Wealth Management and Institutional Asset Management businesses.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The Risk Management section included in Item 7 of our 2020 Form 10-K describes our enterprise risk management framework including risk culture, enterprise strategy, risk
governance and oversight framework, risk identification, risk assessment, risk controls and monitoring, and risk aggregation and reporting. Additionally, our 2020 Form 10-K
provides an analysis of the firm's Capital Management and our key areas of risk, which include but are not limited to Credit, Market, Liquidity and Operational (including
Compliance and Information Security).

Upon closing of the acquisition of BBVA, the PNC Enterprise Risk Management Framework applies to the legal entities acquired from BBVA S.A., including BBVA USA.
Prior to closing, PNC’s Independent Risk Management group evaluated and updated the frameworks, policies and procedures of the acquired BBVA entities as necessary. The
updates were made to align the acquired BBVA entities with PNC’s risk appetite and connected the elements of their respective risk governance and reporting into PNC’s
existing enterprise risk framework. Connecting the existing BBVA risk governance and reporting framework into PNC’s existing enterprise risk framework allows separate risk
profiles, governance, and reporting for PNC Bank and the acquired BBVA entities, during the period from acquisition through conversion, while also providing the ability to
consolidate into one enterprise risk profile that will be communicated through the established risk governance and reporting for PNC. Upon the merger of BBVA USA into PNC
Bank, anticipated for October 2021, the updated BBVA risk governance and reporting framework will no longer be applicable as all entities will be under PNC's framework.

Credit Risk Management

Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk is inherent in the financial
services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit
risk is one of our most significant risks. Our processes for managing credit risk are designed to be embedded in our risk culture and in our decision-making processes using a

20    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q

systematic approach whereby credit risks and related exposures are identified and assessed, managed through specific policies and processes, measured and evaluated against
our risk appetite and credit concentration limits, and reported, along with specific mitigation activities, to management and the Board of Directors through our governance
structure. Our most significant concentration of credit risk is in our loan portfolio.

Loan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis

Table 14: Details of Loans
In billions

We use several credit quality indicators, as further detailed in Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item
1 of this Report, to monitor and measure our exposure to credit risk within our loan portfolio. The following provides additional information about the significant loan classes
that comprise our Commercial and Consumer portfolio segments.

Commercial

Commercial and Industrial
Commercial and industrial loans comprised 53% and 55% of our total loan portfolio at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The majority of our commercial and
industrial loans are secured by collateral that provides a secondary source of repayment for the loan should the borrower experience cash generation difficulties. Examples of
this collateral include short-term assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and securities, and long-lived assets, such as equipment, real estate and other business assets.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q 21  

We actively manage our commercial and industrial loans to assess any changes (both positive and negative) in the level of credit risk at both the borrower and portfolio level.
To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign internal risk ratings reflecting our estimates of the borrower’s PD and LGD for each related credit facility. This two-dimensional
credit risk rating methodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring process and is updated on an ongoing basis through our credit risk management processes. In addition
to monitoring the level of credit risk, we also monitor concentrations of credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and geography that may exist in our portfolio. Our
commercial and industrial portfolio is well-diversified as shown in the following table which provides a breakout by industry classification (classified based on the NAICS).

The increase in commercial and industrial loans compared to December 31, 2020 primarily reflects the $28.3 billion of commercial and industrial loans from BBVA. Amounts
also include $11.6 billion of PPP loans outstanding at June 30, 2021, $2.1 billion of which were from BBVA. PPP loans outstanding at December 31, 2020 totaled $12.0
billion. For additional information on PPP lending, see the COVID-19 Relief section within Item I of our 2020 Form 10-K.

See the Commercial High Impact Industries discussion within this Credit Risk Management section for additional discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our commercial
portfolio and how we are evaluating and monitoring the portfolio for elevated levels of credit risk.

Commercial Real Estate
Commercial real estate loans comprised $21.4 billion related to commercial mortgages, $8.6 billion of real estate project loans and $8.0 billion of intermediate term financing
loans as of June 30, 2021. Comparable amounts as of December 31, 2020 were $17.3 billion, $6.3 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively. Balances at June 30, 2021 include
BBVA contributions of $4.6 billion, $1.8 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively.

We monitor credit risk associated with our commercial real estate loans similar to commercial and industrial loans by analyzing PD and LGD. Additionally, risks associated
with these types of credit activities tend to be correlated to the loan structure, collateral location, project progress and business environment. These attributes are also monitored
and utilized in assessing credit risk. The portfolio is geographically diverse due to the nature of our business involving clients throughout the U.S.

Commercial High Impact Industries
In light of the economic circumstances related to COVID-19, we are continuing to evaluate and monitor our entire commercial portfolio for elevated levels of credit risk;
however, the industry sectors that have been and we believe will continue to be most likely impacted by the effects of the pandemic are:

•

Non-real estate related

•
•
•
•
•
•

Leisure recreation: restaurants, casinos, hotels, convention centers
Non-essential retail: retail excluding auto, gas, staples
Healthcare facilities: elective, private practices
Consumer services: religious organizations, childcare
Leisure travel: cruise, airlines, other travel/transportation
Other impacted areas: shipping, senior living, specialty education

•

Real estate related

•
•
•

Non-essential retail and restaurants: malls, lifestyle centers, outlets, restaurants
Hotel: full service, limited service, extended stay
Seniors housing: assisted living, independent living

As of June 30, 2021, our outstanding loan balances in these industries totaled $22.9 billion, or approximately 8% of our total loan portfolio, while additional unfunded loan
commitments totaled $13.8 billion. BBVA contributed $7.0 billion of outstanding loans and $2.4 billion of unfunded loan commitments to these high impact industries at June
30, 2021. We continue to carefully monitor and manage these loans, and while we have not yet experienced material charge-offs in these industries, we do expect to see
continued stress.

In our non-real estate related category we have $13.6 billion in loans outstanding, $2.7 billion of which are funded through the PPP and guaranteed by the SBA. Nonperforming
loans in these industries totaled $0.2 billion, or 1% of total loans outstanding in the non-real estate related category, while criticized assets totaled $1.9 billion at June 30, 2021
with the greatest stress seen in the leisure recreation and leisure travel sectors.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q 23  

Within the real estate related category we have $9.3 billion in loans outstanding, which includes real estate projects of $6.9 billion and unsecured real estate of $2.4 billion.
Nonperforming loans in these industries totaled $0.3 billion at June 30, 2021, or 3% of total loans outstanding in the commercial real estate related category. In this category,
while loan performance has not materially deteriorated, these industries continue to face headwinds that have resulted in a slower recovery compared with the pace of the
overall economy.

Oil and Gas Loan Portfolio
As of June 30, 2021, our outstanding loans in the oil and gas sector totaled $4.7 billion, or 2% of total loans. This portfolio comprised approximately $1.8 billion in the
midstream and downstream sectors, $1.0 billion of oil services companies and $1.9 billion related to exploration and production companies. Of the oil services category,
approximately $0.2 billion is not asset-based or investment grade. Nonperforming loans in the oil and gas sector as of June 30, 2021 totaled $0.3 billion, or 6% of total loans
outstanding in this sector. Additional unfunded loan commitments for the oil and gas portfolio totaled $10.3 billion at June 30, 2021. BBVA contributed $2.1 billion of
outstanding loans and $3.5 billion of unfunded loan commitments to the oil and gas loan portfolio at June 30, 2021.

Consumer

Residential Real Estate
Residential real estate loans primarily consisted of residential mortgage loans at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. BBVA contributed $13.0 billion of residential real
estate loans to PNC's portfolio at June 30, 2021.

We obtain loan attributes at origination, including original FICO scores and LTVs, and we update these and other credit metrics at least quarterly. We track borrower
performance monthly. We also segment the mortgage portfolio into pools based on product type (e.g., nonconforming, conforming). This information is used for internal
reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status,
modification and bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and geographic concentrations. Loan performance is evaluated by source originators and loan servicers.

Newly originated loans that we retained on our balance sheet over the last twelve months had a weighted-average LTV on originations of 67% and a weighted-average FICO
score of 777.

We originate residential mortgage loans nationwide through our national mortgage business as well as within our branch network. Residential mortgage loans underwritten to
agency standards, including conforming loan amount limits, are typically sold with servicing retained by us. We also originate nonconforming residential mortgage loans that do
not meet agency standards, which we retain on our balance sheet. Our portfolio of originated nonconforming residential mortgage loans totaled $28.0 billion at June 30, 2021
with 41% located in California.

24    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q

Home Equity
Home equity loans comprised $15.1 billion of primarily variable-rate home equity lines of credit and $10.1 billion of closed-end home equity installment loans at June 30,
2021. Comparable amounts were $12.6 billion and $11.5 billion as of December 31, 2020, respectively. Balances at June 30, 2021 include BBVA contributions of $2.3 billion
and $0.1 billion, respectively.

We track borrower performance of this portfolio monthly similarly to residential real estate loans. We also segment the population into pools based on product type (e.g., home
equity loans, brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, brokered home equity lines of credit) and track the historical performance of any related mortgage loans
regardless of whether we hold the lien. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment
the portfolio based upon the loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV, lien position and geographic concentration.

Newly originated loans over the last twelve months had a weighted-average LTV on originations of 65% and a weighted-average FICO score of 782.

The credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we hold the first lien position is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien
position, but do not hold the first lien. Lien position information is generally determined at the time of origination and monitored on an ongoing basis for risk management
purposes. We use an industry-leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan information, including lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and
private sources.

(a) Weighted-averages calculated for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, using the auto enhanced FICO scale.

We continue to focus on borrowers with strong credit profiles as evidenced by the weighted-average loan origination FICO scores noted in Table 19. We offer both new and
used auto financing to customers through our various channels. The portfolio balance was composed of 54% new vehicle loans and 46% used vehicle loans at June 30, 2021.
Comparable amounts at December 31, 2020 were 56% and 44%, respectively.

The auto loan portfolio’s performance is measured monthly, including updated collateral values that are obtained monthly and updated FICO scores that are obtained at least
quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product channel and product type and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience.
As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the portfolio by geography, channel, collateral attributes and credit metrics which include FICO score, LTV and
term.

Nonperforming Assets and Loan Delinquencies

Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual principal and interest is not probable and
include nonperforming TDRs and PCD loans, OREO and foreclosed assets. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under
the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our 2020
Form 10-K for details on our nonaccrual policies.

Nonperforming assets at June 30, 2021 included $880 million of nonperforming assets from BBVA, of which $847 million was in the commercial portfolio, $24 million in the
consumer portfolio and $9 million of OREO and foreclosed assets. Declines in PNC legacy nonperforming assets from December 31, 2020 reflected improved credit
performance.

As of June 30, 2021 approximately 97% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral which lessened reserve requirements and is expected to reduce credit losses.

Within consumer nonperforming loans, residential real estate TDRs comprised 47% of total residential real estate nonperforming loans while home equity TDRs comprised 38%
of home equity nonperforming loans at June 30, 2021. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2020 were 47% and 41%, respectively. TDRs generally remain in nonperforming
status until a borrower has made at least six consecutive months of both principal and interest payments under the modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs. Loans where
borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us and loans to borrowers not
currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status. Loans that have been restructured for COVID-19
related hardships and meet certain criteria under the CARES Act are not identified as TDRs. Refer to the Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan Modifications discussion in
this Credit Risk Management section for more information on the treatment of loan modifications under the CARES Act.

At June 30, 2021, our largest nonperforming asset was $141 million in the Real Estate and Rental and Leasing industry and the ten largest individual nonperforming assets
represented 17% of total nonperforming assets.

Loan Delinquencies
We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels may be a key indicator of credit quality in our loan portfolio. Measurement of delinquency status
is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies include government
insured or guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under the fair value option and PCD loans. Amounts exclude loans held for sale.

Pursuant to the interagency guidance issued in April 2020 and in connection with the credit reporting rules from the CARES Act, the June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020
delinquency status of loans modified due to COVID-19 related hardships aligns with the rules set forth for banks to report delinquency status to the credit agencies. These rules
require that COVID-19 related loan modifications be reported as follows:

•
•

•

if current at the time of modification, the loan remains current throughout the modification period,
if delinquent at the time of modification and the borrower was not made current as part of the modification, the loan maintains its reported delinquent status during the
modification period, or
if delinquent at the time of modification and the borrower was made current as part of the modification or became current during the modification period, the loan is
reported as current.

As a result, certain loans modified due to COVID-19 related hardships are not being reported as past due as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 based on the contractual
terms of the loan, even where borrowers may not be making payments on their loans during the modification period. Loan modifications due to COVID-19 related hardships
that permanently reduce either the contractual interest rate or the principal balance of a loan do not qualify for TDR relief under the CARES Act or the interagency guidance.
See the COVID-19 Relief section in Item 1 of our 2020 Form 10-K for more information on the CARES Act and the related interagency guidance.

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more continue to accrue interest because they are (i) well secured by collateral and are in the process of collection, (ii) managed in
homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines, or (iii) certain government insured or guaranteed loans. As such, they are
excluded from nonperforming loans.

Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan Modifications

Troubled Debt Restructurings
A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs result from our loss mitigation
activities and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss
and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Additionally, TDRs also result from court-imposed concessions (e.g., a Chapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is
discharged from personal liability to us and a court approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan). Loans to borrowers experiencing COVID-19 related hardships that have
been restructured but that meet certain criteria under the CARES Act are not categorized as TDRs. For additional information on the CARES Act, including TDR treatment
under the CARES Act and interagency guidance, see the COVID-19 Relief section within Item 1 of our 2020 Form 10-K.

The following table provides a summary of Troubled Debt Restructurings at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively:

(a) Amounts in table do not include associated valuation allowances.
(b) Accruing loans include consumer credit card loans and certain loans that have demonstrated a period of at least six months of performance under the restructured terms and are excluded from nonperforming loans.

Nonperforming TDRs represented approximately 27% of total nonperforming loans and 51% of total TDRs at June 30, 2021. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2020 were
39% and 55%, respectively. The remaining portion of TDRs represents TDRs that have been returned to accrual status after performing under the restructured terms for at least
six consecutive months.

See Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report for additional information on
TDRs.

Loan Modifications
During the first six months of 2021, PNC continued to provide relief to our customers from the economic impacts of COVID-19 through a variety of solutions, including
additional grants and extensions of loan and lease modifications under our hardship relief programs. We continued to see a reduction in the number of customers in active
assistance from the peak in the summer of 2020, which led to additional declines in loans under modification that present credit risk to PNC at June 30, 2021.

28    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The impact of these modifications was considered within the quarterly reserve determination. See the Allowance for Credit Losses discussion within the Critical Accounting
Estimates and Judgments section of this Financial Review for additional information. Refer to the Loan Delinquencies discussion in this Credit Risk Management section for
information on how these hardship related loan modifications are reported from a delinquency perspective as of June 30, 2021.

Under the CARES Act, loan modifications meeting certain criteria qualify the loan for relief from TDR treatment. Loans that do not meet the criteria for TDR relief under the
CARES Act may also be evaluated under interagency guidance. For additional information on this criteria, see the Loan Modifications discussion in the Credit Risk
Management section within Item 7 of our 2020 Form 10-K.

Consumer Loan Modifications Under Hardship Relief Programs
Our consumer loan modification programs are being granted in response to customer hardships that extended beyond the initial relief period. These loan and line modifications
include all hardship related modifications. See the Loan Modifications discussion within Credit Risk Management in Item 7 of our 2020 Form 10-K for additional details.

The following table provides a summary of consumer accounts in active assistance under hardship relief programs that were on our balance sheet at June 30, 2021. Excluded
from Table 24 are government insured or guaranteed loans totaling $371 million and $282 million in the Residential real estate and Education loans classes, respectively. These
loans present minimal credit risk to PNC. Loans in active hardship assistance programs offered by BBVA prior to acquisition were $69 million at June 30, 2021 and are
excluded from Table 24.

Modifications are considered to have exited active assistance after the modification period has expired or the modification was exited. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 97%
of the accruing consumer loans that have exited hardship relief program modifications offered by legacy PNC were current or less than 30 days past due.

See the Credit Risk Management section within Item 7 of our 2020 Form 10-K for information on the TDR impacts of our modification programs.

Allowance for Credit Losses
Our ACL is based on historical loss experience, current borrower risk characteristics, current economic conditions, reasonable and
supportable forecasts of future conditions and other relevant factors. We maintain the ACL at an appropriate level for expected losses
on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases (including residual values), other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments and
determine this allowance based on quarterly assessments of the remaining estimated contractual term of the assets or exposures as of the balance sheet date.

See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our 2020 Form 10-K and the Credit Risk Management section within
Item 7 of our 2020 Form 10-K for additional discussion of our ACL, including details of our methodologies. See also the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section
of this Financial Review for further discussion of the assumptions used in the determination of the ACL as of June 30, 2021.

were largely the result of required purchase accounting treatment for the acquisition.

See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our 2020 Form 10-K and Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for
Credit Losses in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Report for additional information.

Liquidity and Capital Management

Liquidity risk, including our liquidity monitoring measures and tools, is described in further detail in the Liquidity and Capital Management section of our 2020 Form 10-K.

One of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by reference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure that covered banking organizations
maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a hypothetical 30-day stress scenario. The LCR is calculated by dividing the amount of an
institution’s HQLA, as calculated in accordance with the LCR rules, by its estimated, weighted net cash outflows, with net cash outflows determined by applying the assumed
outflow factors in the LCR rules. The resulting quotient is expressed as a percentage. Effective January 1, 2020, PNC and PNC Bank, as Category III institutions under the
Tailoring Rules, were subject to a reduced LCR requirement, with each company's net outflows reduced by 15%, thereby reducing the amount of HQLA each institution must
hold to meet the LCR minimum requirement. The minimum LCR that PNC and PNC Bank are required to maintain continues to be 100%. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the
LCR daily, and as of June 30, 2021, the LCR for PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the requirement of 100%.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q 31  

Additionally, the acquisition of BBVA moved BBVA USA from a Category IV bank to a Category III bank. Due to certain transition provisions in the LCR rules, as a Category
III bank, BBVA USA will not be subject to the LCR on a standalone basis as it is anticipated to be merged into PNC Bank prior to the effective date for LCR compliance in
2022.

We provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on us in the Supervision and Regulation and Recent Regulatory
Developments section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2020 Form 10-K.

Sources of Liquidity
Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. These deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost
funding. Total deposits increased to $452.9 billion at June 30, 2021 from $365.3 billion at December 31, 2020, driven by growth in both interest-bearing and noninterest-
bearing deposits primarily due to $82.2 billion from the BBVA acquisition. See the Funding Sources portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial
Review for additional information related to our deposits. Additionally, certain assets determined by us to be liquid as well as unused borrowing capacity from a number of
sources are also available to manage our liquidity position.

At June 30, 2021, our liquid assets consisted of cash and due from banks and short-term investments (federal funds sold, resale agreements, trading securities and interest-
earning deposits with banks) totaling $83.8 billion and securities available for sale totaling $125.1 billion. The level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many factors,
including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. Our liquid assets included $24.0 billion of securities available for sale and
trading securities pledged as collateral to secure public and trust deposits, repurchase agreements and for other purposes. In addition, $0.1 billion of securities held to maturity
were also pledged as collateral for these purposes.

We also obtain liquidity through various forms of funding, including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and FHLB borrowings) and short-term borrowings
(securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings). See the Funding Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review
in this Report and Note 10 Borrowed Funds in Item 8 of our 2020 Form 10-K for additional information related to our borrowings.

Total senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, increased due to the following activity:

Bank Liquidity
Under PNC Bank’s 2014 bank note program, as amended, PNC Bank may from time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of
its unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes)
from their date of issue. At June 30, 2021, PNC Bank had $17.4 billion of notes outstanding under this program of which $12.4 billion were senior bank notes and $5.0 billion
were subordinated bank notes.

At June 30, 2021, BBVA USA had $2.1 billion of notes outstanding, of which $1.3 billion were senior bank notes and $0.8 billion were subordinated bank notes.

PNC Bank and BBVA USA maintain additional secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB and through the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. The Federal Reserve
Bank, however, is not viewed as a primary means of funding our routine business activities, but rather as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a
market disruption. At June 30, 2021, our unused secured borrowing capacity at the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank totaled $96.4 billion, of which $17.3 billion is from the
BBVA acquisition.

PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of June 30, 2021, there were no issuances outstanding under this
program.

Additionally, PNC Bank may also access funding from the parent company through deposits placed at the bank, or through issuing senior unsecured notes.

Parent Company Liquidity
In addition to managing liquidity risk at the bank level, we monitor the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s contractual obligations consist primarily of debt
service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the parent company maintains adequate liquidity to fund discretionary activities
such as paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases and acquisitions.

On April 23, 2021, the parent company issued $1.0 billion of senior fixed-to-floating rate notes with a maturity date of April 23, 2032. Interest is payable semi-annually in
arrears at a fixed rate of 2.307% per annum, on April 23 and October 23 of each year, beginning on October 23, 2021. Beginning on April 23, 2031, interest is payable quarterly
in arrears at a floating rate per annum equal to
Compounded SOFR (determined with respect to each quarterly interest period using the SOFR Index), plus 0.97926%, on July 23, 2031, October 23, 2031, January 23, 2032
and at the maturity date.

As of June 30, 2021, available parent company liquidity totaled $4.5 billion. During the second quarter of 2021, PNC used approximately $11.5 billion of parent company cash
to acquire BBVA. Parent company liquidity is primarily held in intercompany cash. Investments with longer durations may also be acquired, and if so, the related maturities are
aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity of parent company debt obligations.

The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends it receives from PNC Bank and BBVA USA, which may be impacted by the following:

•
•
•
•
•

Bank-level capital needs,
Laws and regulations,
Corporate policies,
Contractual restrictions, and
Other factors.

There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non-
bank subsidiaries. The amount available for dividend payments by PNC Bank to the parent company without prior regulatory approval was approximately $3.0 billion at
June 30, 2021. See Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these limitations. Due to
the net earnings restrictions on dividend distributions under Alabama law, BBVA USA was not permitted to pay dividends at June 30, 2021 without regulatory approval.

In addition to dividends from PNC Bank or BBVA USA, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments
from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNC’s non-bank subsidiaries through
the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. The parent company has the ability to offer
up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of June 30, 2021, there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding.

The parent company has an effective shelf registration statement pursuant of which we can issue debt, equity and other capital instruments. See Note 16 Subsequent Events for
information on the August 2021 redemption of $500 million of senior notes by the parent company.

Parent company senior and subordinated debt outstanding totaled $11.3 billion and $10.6 billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q 33  

Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We have contractual obligations representing required future payments on borrowed funds, time deposits, leases, pension and postretirement benefits and purchase obligations.
See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2020 Form 10-K for more information on these future cash outflows. Additionally, in
the normal course of business we have various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We provide information on our
commitments in Note 8 Commitments in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report.

Credit Ratings
PNC’s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments and the ability to offer certain
products.

In general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of
earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied government support. A decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access
to the capital markets and/or increase the cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition.

The following table presents credit ratings for PNC, PNC Bank and BBVA USA as of June 30, 2021:

Capital Management
Detailed information on our capital management processes and activities, including additional information on our previous CCAR submissions and capital plans, is included in
the Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2020 Form 10-K.

We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming debt, issuing equity or other capital
instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions or repurchases, and managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.

On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve released the results of its supervisory stress tests conducted as part of the 2021 CCAR process. Based on the results of the Federal
Reserve’s supervisory stress tests, PNC’s SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2021, applicable to PNC inclusive of the BBVA acquisition, is 2.5%, which is
the regulatory floor and the minimum SCB amount.

We returned capital to shareholders through dividends on common shares of $0.5 billion and refrained from repurchasing shares through the second quarter of 2021 due to the
BBVA transaction.

In June 2021, we announced the reinstatement of our share repurchase programs with repurchases of up to $2.9 billion for the four-quarter period beginning in the third quarter
of 2021. The timing and amount of executed repurchases will be based on market conditions and other factors including the integration of BBVA. Common share repurchases
will be made under the 100 million share repurchase program approved by PNC's Board of Directors in April 2019.

34    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q

  
On July 1, 2021, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to $1.25 per share, an increase of 10 cents per share, or 9%, effective with the
August 5, 2021 dividend payment.

PNC’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. Under the standardized approach for determining
credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, nonaccruals, TDRs, past due
exposures and equity exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.

The regulatory agencies have adopted a rule permitting banking organizations to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from implementing CECL. CECL’s
estimated impact on CET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the change in retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet
date, excluding the initial allowance for PCD loans from BBVA, compared to CECL ACL at transition. PNC elected to adopt this optional transition provision effective as of
June 30, 2020. See additional discussion of this rule in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2020 Form 10-K.

At June 30, 2021, PNC, PNC Bank and BBVA USA were considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements. To qualify as “well
capitalized”, PNC must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based capital and 10% for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank and BBVA USA must have
Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at
least 5%.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q 35  

Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital well in excess of the regulatory minimum
and have required the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers
through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and believe that our June 30, 2021 capital levels were aligned
with them.

We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on us in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1
Business, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2020 Form 10-K.

Market Risk Management

See the Market Risk Management portion of the Risk Management Section in our 2020 Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding market risk.

Market Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions,
movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of
our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not
only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.

Our Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our risk management policies, which are approved by management’s Asset and
Liability Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.

Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the second quarter of 2021 and 2020 follow:

In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest
rate environments. Table 32 reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12-month periods, including BBVA USA, assuming (i) the PNC
Economist’s most likely rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates and (iii) yield curve slope flattening (a 100 basis point yield curve slope flattening between one-month
and ten-year rates superimposed on current base rates) scenario.

All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon.

When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business and the
behavior of existing on- and off-balance sheet positions. These assumptions determine the

36    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q

future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in Tables 31 and 32. These simulations assume that
as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then current market rates.

The following graph presents the LIBOR/Swap yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward.

Table 33: Alternate Interest Rate Scenarios: One Year Forward

The second quarter 2021 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to benefit from an increase in interest rates and an upward
sloping interest rate yield curve. We believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest
rates and market conditions.

As discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2020 Form 10-K, the planned discontinuance of the requirement that banks submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2023
presents risks to the financial instruments originated, held or serviced by PNC that use LIBOR as a reference rate. PNC holds instruments and services its instruments and
instruments owned by others that may be impacted by the likely discontinuance of LIBOR, including loans, investments, hedging products, floating-rate obligations, and other
financial instruments that use LIBOR as a reference rate. The transition from LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark will subject PNC, like other financial participants, to
financial, legal, operational, and reputational risks.

In order to address LIBOR cessation and the associated risks, PNC has established a cross-functional governance structure to oversee the overall strategy for the transition from
LIBOR and mitigate risks associated with the transition. An initial LIBOR impact and risk assessment has been performed, which identified the associated risks across
products, systems, models, and processes. PNC also established an enterprise-level program, which is actively monitoring PNC’s overall firm-wide exposure to LIBOR and
using these results to plan transitional strategies and track progress versus these goals. Program workstreams were formed by Line of Business to ensure accountability and
alignment with the appropriate operational, technology, and customer-facing stakeholders, while establishing a centralized Program Management Office to ensure consistency in
execution and communication. Project plans and established milestones have been developed and have continued to evolve and be refined in line with industry developments
and internal decisions and progress. PNC is also involved in industry discussions, preparing milestones for readiness and assessing progress against those milestones, along
with developing and delivering on internal and external LIBOR cessation communication plans.

Key efforts in 2020 and the first six months of 2021 included:

Enhancing fallback language in new contracts and reviewing existing legal contracts/agreements to assess fallback language impacts,

•
• Making preparations for internal operational readiness,
• Making necessary enhancements to PNC's infrastructure, including systems, models, valuation tools and processes,
•
•
• Monitoring developments associated with LIBOR alternatives and industry practices related to LIBOR-indexed instruments.

Developing and delivering on internal and external LIBOR cessation communication plans,
Engaging with PNC clients, industry working groups and regulators, and

PNC also has been an active participant in efforts with the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies to explore the potential need for a credit-sensitive rate or add-on to
SOFR for use in commercial loans. Those efforts led to the formation of the Credit Sensitivity Group, which has held a series of workshops to assess how a credit-sensitive rate
or add-on to SOFR might be constructed and discuss associated implementation issues.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q 37  

In late 2020, PNC began offering conforming adjustable rate mortgages using SOFR instead of USD LIBOR in line with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac requirements. In the
second quarter of 2021, PNC began offering nonconforming adjustable rate mortgages using SOFR and private student loans using Prime. Plans are in place to begin offering
alternative rates to our corporate and commercial customers in the third quarter of 2021. PNC has provided regular updates to Federal Reserve, OCC and Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation examination staff regarding its LIBOR cessation and transition plans.

Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk
We engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging activities. These transactions, related
hedges and the credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities.We do
not engage in proprietary trading of these products.

We use VaR as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on
the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. VaR is calculated for each of the portfolios that comprise our customer related trading activities of which the majority are
covered positions as defined by the Market Risk Rule. VaR is computed with positions and market risk factors updated daily to ensure each portfolio is operating within its
acceptable limits.

See the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk section of our 2020 Form 10-K for more information on our models used to calculate VaR and our
backtesting process.

Customer related trading revenue was $179 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, of which $5.2 million was from BBVA, compared to $185 million for the same
period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rate derivative client sales revenues partially offset by changes in the credit valuation for customer-related
derivatives activities. For the quarterly period, customer related trading revenue was $68 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $114 million in 2020. The decrease
was primarily due to lower customer-related trading revenues.

Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment Risk
Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits,
underwriting securities and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations
and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity. The economic
and/or book value of these investments and other assets are directly affected by changes in market factors.

Various PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy
limits and associated guidelines.

Tax Credit Investments
Included in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated entities. These tax credit investment balances included
unfunded commitments totaling $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. These unfunded commitments are included in Other liabilities on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Note 5 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K has further information on
Tax Credit Investments.

Private Equity and Other
The largest component of our other equity investments is our private equity portfolio. The private equity portfolio is an illiquid portfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity
investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion at June 30, 2021
and December 31, 2020, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, $1.5 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and $0.2 billion was invested indirectly through various
private equity funds. See the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of our 2020 Form 10-K for discussion of the potential impacts of the Volcker Rule provisions of
Dodd-Frank on our interests in and other relationships with private funds covered by the Volcker Rule.

38    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q

 
Included in our other equity investments are Visa Class B common shares, which are recorded at cost. Visa Class B common shares that we own are transferable only under
limited circumstances until they can be converted into shares of the publicly-traded Class A common shares, which cannot happen until the resolution of the pending
interchange litigation. Based upon the June 30, 2021 per share closing price of $233.82 for a Visa Class A common share, the estimated value of our total investment in the
Class B common shares was approximately $1.3 billion at the current conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares, while our cost basis was not significant. See Note 15
Fair Value and Note 21 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2020 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our Visa
agreements. The estimated value does not represent fair value of the Visa B common shares given the share’s limited transferability and the lack of observable transactions in
the marketplace.

We also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment
strategies. Net gains related to these investments were $42 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and were not significant for the six months ended June 30, 2020.

Financial Derivatives
We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to market (primarily interest rate) and credit
risk inherent in our business activities. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities.

Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment
and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional and an underlying as specified in the contract. Therefore, cash requirements
and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments.

Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 15 Fair Value and Note 16 Financial Derivatives in our Notes To
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K and in Note 11 Fair Value and Note 12 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 1 of this Report.

Not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to
unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.

RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

BBVA Acquisition
On June 1, 2021, and following regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve and the OCC, PNC acquired BBVA, a BHC registered under the BHC Act and a financial
holding company under the GLB Act, and its U.S. state member bank subsidiary, BBVA USA, headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. The regulatory approval process also
included approvals from the banking departments of the states of Alabama and Texas. BBVA USA is primarily regulated by the Federal Reserve and the Alabama State
Banking Department. BBVA USA, like PNC Bank, is also subject to regulation by the FDIC, which insures certain deposits of BBVA USA, and the CFPB, among other
regulatory agencies.

PNC also acquired certain nonbanking subsidiaries of BBVA that are subject to regulation by various federal and state bodies, including state regulators of money transfer and
insurance entities. This includes BBVA Transfer Holdings, Inc. (now known as PNC Payment Holdings, Inc.), a company engaged in money transfer services and related
activities, including money transmission and foreign exchange services, through its two subsidiaries, BBVA Transfer Services, Inc. (now known as PNC Global Transfers, Inc.)
and BBVA Foreign Exchange, Inc. (now known as PNC Global Transfers FX, Inc.). PNC also acquired BBVA USA’s subsidiaries, including BBVA Wealth Solutions, Inc.
(now known as PNC Managed Account Solutions, Inc.), an SEC-registered investment adviser, and BBVA Insurance Agency, Inc. (now known as PNC Insurance Agency,
Inc.), a state-regulated insurance agency. PNC also expects its broker-dealer subsidiary PNC Investments to assume responsibility for approximately 100,000 retail brokerage
accounts of the U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary of BBVA S.A., BBVA Securities, Inc.

Shortly after the acquisition, PNC merged BBVA into PNC, and PNC contributed all of the shares of BBVA USA to PNC Bancorp, Inc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PNC. As
a result, BBVA USA is now a subsidiary of PNC Bancorp, Inc. and an affiliate of PNC Bank. PNC expects to merge BBVA USA into PNC Bank in October 2021. In addition,
PNC Payment Holdings, Inc., and its two subsidiaries are now nonbank subsidiaries of PNC and affiliates of PNC Bank and BBVA USA.

Capital, Capital Planning and Liquidity
BBVA USA has been incorporated into PNC’s consolidated capital and liquidity metrics and reporting, capital planning, stress testing, and other regulatory requirements.
Additionally, as a result of the acquisition of BBVA USA by PNC, a Category III banking organization under the Federal Reserve’s Enhanced Prudential Standards, BBVA
USA is now a Category III bank. Subject to certain

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q 39  

transition provisions and any relief granted by the Federal Reserve, we expect BBVA USA to be merged with PNC Bank prior to the LCR or NSFR becoming effective for
BBVA USA.

In June 2021, the Federal Reserve announced the results of its supervisory stress tests for 2021. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management
section in this Item 2 for a discussion of PNC’s results and capital actions. PNC remained well above its risk-based minimum capital requirements in the supervisory stress
tests, and as a result, will no longer be subject to the Federal Reserve’s temporary restrictions on BHC dividends and share repurchases that it put in place last year as a result of
ongoing uncertainty from COVID-19.

Other Developments
In June 2021, the FDIC released a statement outlining its modified approach to implementing its rule requiring insured depository institutions like PNC Bank and BBVA USA
to submit resolution plans. These resolution plans must describe, among other things, how the banks could be resolved in an orderly and timely manner in the event of
receivership, and the failure to submit a credible plan
could result in regulatory actions or restrictions. The modified approach extends the frequency of insured depository institution resolution plans to a three-year cycle,
streamlines the content requirements, and places greater emphasis on continued engagement with firms. PNC Bank and BBVA USA expect to receive additional information
from the FDIC detailing certain plan contents and the due date for their next filings. PNC does not expect BBVA USA to have to file a resolution plan before BBVA USA is
merged into
PNC Bank.

On July 31, 2021, the federal foreclosure moratorium imposed by various federal agencies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic expired. However, on July 30, 2021, the
Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Federal Housing Administration extended their eviction moratoria through September 30, 2021. On August 3, 2021, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention issued a revised eviction moratorium applying to U.S. counties experiencing substantial and high levels of community transmission of COVID-
19 through October 3, 2021. Around the same time, the CFPB finalized a set of Regulation X changes to provide foreclosure protections to borrowers as the emergency federal
foreclosure protections expire. The CFPB’s final rule generally bars mortgage servicers like PNC Bank and BBVA USA from filing new foreclosure filings until December 31,
2021, unless certain procedural safeguards are met or an exception applies; permits mortgage servicers to offer streamlined loan modification options to borrowers with
COVID-19-related hardships based on the evaluation of an incomplete application; and makes temporary changes to certain required servicer communications that borrowers
receive regarding their options. The final rule is effective August 31, 2021.

In July 2021, the OCC announced it plans to rescind its June 2020 rule that significantly altered the regulations implementing the CRA for national banks like PNC Bank. The
OCC also does not plan to finalize its December 4, 2020 proposed rule regarding performance metrics under the June 2020 rule.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2020 Form 10-K describes the most significant accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Certain of
these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions, and such variations may significantly affect our
reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. The policies and judgments related to residential and commercial MSRs and fair value measurements
are described in Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments in Item 7 of our 2020 Form 10-K. For additional information on fair value measurements of assets and liabilities
assumed in the BBVA acquisition, see Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. The following
details the critical estimates and judgments around the ACL.

Allowance for Credit Losses

We maintain the ACL at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on our existing investment securities, loans,
equipment finance leases (including residual values), other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments, for the remaining contractual term of the assets or
exposures, taking into consideration expected prepayments. Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss experience, current borrower characteristics, current
economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions and other relevant factors. We use methods sensitive to changes in economic conditions, to
interpret these factors to estimate expected credit losses. We evaluate and, when appropriate, enhance the quality of our data and models and other methods used to estimate
ACL on an ongoing basis. We apply qualitative factors to reflect in the ACL our best estimate of amounts that we do not expect to collect because of, among other things,
idiosyncratic risk factors, changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in forecasted results, or other potential methodology limitations. The ACL estimates are
therefore susceptible to various factors, including, but not limited to, the following major factors:

•

Current economic conditions and borrower quality: Our forecast of expected losses depends on economic conditions and
portfolio quality as of the estimation date. As current economic conditions evolve, forecasted losses could be materially         
affected.

40    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q

•

•

Scenario weights and design: Our loss estimates are sensitive to the shape, direction and rate of change of macroeconomic forecasts and thus vary significantly between
upside and downside scenarios. Change to probability weights assigned to these scenarios and timing of peak business cycles reflected by the scenarios could materially
affect our loss estimates.
Portfolio volume and mix: Changes to portfolio volume and mix could materially affect our estimates, as CECL reserves
would be recognized upon origination or acquisition.

For all assets and unfunded lending related commitments within the scope of the CECL standard, the applicable ACL is composed of one or a combination of the following
components: (i) collectively assessed or pooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed reserves, and
(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our methodologies and key assumptions for each of these components are discussed in Note 1
Accounting Policies in our 2020 Form 10-K.

Reasonable and Supportable Economic Forecast
Under CECL, we are required to consider reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses. For this purpose,
we have established a framework which includes a three year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios with associated probability weights, which in combination
create a forecast of expected economic outcomes over our reasonable and supportable forecast period. Credit losses estimated in our reasonable and supportable forecast period
are sensitive to the shape and severity of the scenarios used and weights assigned to them.

To generate the four economic forecast scenarios we use a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of economic activity and forward-looking expert
judgment to forecast the distribution of economic outcomes over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. Each scenario is then given an associated probability (weight)
in order to represent our current expectation within that distribution over the forecast period. This process is informed by current economic conditions, expected business cycle
evolution and the expert judgment of PNC’s RAC. This approach seeks to provide a reasonable representation of the forecast of expected economic outcomes and is used to
estimate expected credit losses across a variety of loans and securities. Each quarter the scenarios are presented for approval to PNC’s RAC and the committee determines and
approves CECL scenarios' weights for use for the current reporting period.

The scenarios used for the period ended June 30, 2021 were designed to reflect an improved near-term economic outlook in comparison to the scenarios used for the period
ended December 31, 2020. This improvement was driven largely by improvements in both the outlook for consumer spending and the labor market due to the passage of the
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and continued vaccine distribution. We used a number of economic variables in our scenarios, with the most significant drivers being Real
GDP and unemployment rate measures. Using the weighted-average of our four economic forecast scenarios, we estimated that:

•
•

Real GDP grows 6.1% in 2021, ending the year 3.6% above pre-recession levels. Annual growth continues but slows to 2.9% and 2.2% in 2022 and 2023, respectively.
Unemployment rates reflect continued recovery in the labor market in 2021, with the unemployment rate falling to 5.6% by the end of the year. Employment gains were
estimated to continue through the forecast period with the unemployment rate reaching 4.7% and 4.1% by the end of 2022 and 2023, respectively.

One of the scenarios included in our weighted-average is our baseline prediction of the most likely economic outcome. This scenario includes estimated Real GDP ending 2021
4.2% above its pre-recession peak levels, with annual growth slowing to 2.9% and 2.0% in 2022 and 2023, respectively, with unemployment rates expected to reach 5.0% by the
end of 2021, 4.2% by the end of 2022 and 3.8% by the end of 2023. See our Business Outlook and the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information in this
Financial Review for additional discussion on our baseline prediction of the most likely economic outcome.

The economy has seen significant recovery from the onset of the pandemic. National macroeconomic indicators, forecasts and performance expectations have all improved,
helping to lower overall loss expectations. These improvements have been reflected in the reserve releases through the first half of 2021. However, for certain portions of our
commercial and consumer portfolios considerable uncertainty remains regarding lifetime losses. For commercial borrowers, there are still lingering concerns around industries
that have been affected by COVID-19 related restrictions and emerging secular changes. For these industries, where unrestricted commerce has recently returned, the recovery
will lag the broader economy. Where restrictions persist and/or secular changes have emerged, the impact and eventual level of recovery are less certain. For consumer
borrowers, payment behavior once the government stimulus wanes is still difficult to predict. As such, for both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, PNC identified
and performed significant analysis around these segments to ensure our reserves are adequate in the current economic environment. We believe the economic scenarios have
effectively provided sufficient variation to capture probable recovery paths. Additionally, through in depth and granular analysis of COVID-19 related impacts, we have
adequately addressed reserve requirements for specific populations most affected in the current environment. Through this approach we believe the reserve levels sufficiently
reflect the expectation for life of loan losses of the current portfolio.

To provide additional context regarding the sensitivity of the ACL to a more pessimistic forecast of expected economic outcomes, we considered what the ACL for the legacy
PNC portfolio would be when applying a 100% probability weighting to the most severely adverse of the four scenarios used in PNC's CECL framework. This severely adverse
scenario estimated Real GDP growing 1.6% and ending 2021 down 0.8% compared to pre-recession peak levels, with year over year growth continuing through 2023, with the

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q 41  

unemployment rate increasing to end 2021 at 9.0% with the labor market showing improvement again beginning in 2022. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments,
this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our ACL of $2.2 billion at June 30, 2021. This scenario was not our expectation at June 30, 2021 and does not
reflect our current expectation, nor does it capture all the potential unknown variables that could arise, but it provides an approximation of a possible outcome under
hypothetical severe conditions. The CECL methodology inherently requires a high degree of judgment, and as a result, it is possible that we may, at another point in time, reach
different conclusions regarding our credit loss estimates.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

We engage in a variety of activities that involve entities that are not consolidated or otherwise reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet that are generally referred to as off-
balance sheet arrangements. Additional information on these types of activities is included in our 2020 Form 10-K and in Note 5 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and
Variable Interest Entities and Note 8 Commitments in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

A summary and further description of VIEs is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 5 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our 2020
Form 10-K.

Trust Preferred Securities

See Note 10 Borrowed Funds in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on trust preferred securities issued by PNC
Capital Trust C including information on contractual limitations potentially imposed on payments (including dividends) with respect to PNC's equity securities.

INTERNAL CONTROLS AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As of June 30, 2021, we performed an evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and of changes
in our internal control over financial reporting.

Based on that evaluation, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective as of June 30, 2021, and that there has been no change in
PNC’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the second quarter of 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

As permitted by SEC guidance that an assessment of internal controls over financial reporting of a recently acquired business may be excluded from management's evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures for up to a year from the date of acquisition, we have excluded BBVA from management's reporting on internal control over financial
reporting for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. We will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as we complete the integration of
BBVA, including BBVA USA, with that of PNC and PNC Bank and will make changes to our internal control framework, as necessary. The acquisition of BBVA contributed
$95.7 of assets, or 17% of our total assets, at June 30, 2021 and $306 million of revenue, or 7% of our total revenue, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 3% of our
total revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

We make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity
levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial position, and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations that are forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “plan,” “expect,”
“anticipate,” “see,” “look,” “intend,” “outlook,” “project,” “forecast,” “estimate,” “goal,” “will,” “should” and other similar words and expressions.

Forward-looking statements are necessarily subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Future events or circumstances may change our
outlook and may also affect the nature of the assumptions, risks and uncertainties to which our forward-looking statements are subject. Forward-looking statements speak only
as of the date made. We do not assume any duty and do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly
materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance. As a result, we caution against placing undue reliance on any forward-
looking statements.

Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties. 

•

Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including:

Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets,

–
– Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets,
– Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply, market interest rates and

inflation,
Changes in customer behavior due to changing business and economic conditions or legislative or regulatory initiatives,
Changes in customers’, suppliers’ and other counterparties’ performance and creditworthiness,
Impacts of tariffs and other trade policies of the U.S. and its global trading partners,
The length and extent of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,
The impact of the results of the recent U.S. elections on the regulatory landscape, capital markets, and the response to and management of the COVID-19
pandemic, including the effectiveness of already-enacted fiscal stimulus from the federal government, a potential infrastructure bill and changes in tax laws, and
Commodity price volatility.

Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently
expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies. These statements are based on our view that:

–

The U.S. economy is in an economic recovery, following a very severe but very short economic contraction in the first half of 2020 due to the COVID-19
pandemic and public health measures to contain it.

– With passage of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and continued vaccine distribution, economic growth has picked up in 2021 and will remain very strong
through the rest of this year and into 2022. Real GDP returned to its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter of 2021. Employment in June 2021 was still down
by 6.8 million from before the pandemic; PNC expects employment to return to its pre-pandemic level in the spring of 2022.
Compared to the spring of 2020 (when prices were falling), inflation has accelerated in mid-2021 due to strong demand in specific segments and supply chain
disruptions. Inflation will slow in the second half of 2021.
PNC expects the FOMC to keep the fed funds rate in its current range of 0.00% to 0.25 % until mid-2023.

•

PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding a stress capital buffer established by the
Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board's CCAR process.
PNC’s regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the company’s financial performance, the scope and terms of final capital regulations
then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of PNC’s balance sheet. In addition, PNC’s ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital
ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and
regulatory review of related models.
Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position,
reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and
ability to attract and retain management. These developments could include:

–

Changes to laws and regulations, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, consumer protection, bank capital and liquidity
standards, pension, bankruptcy and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles.

– Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. These matters may result in

monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines,

–

penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to PNC.
Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.
Impact on business and operating results of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our
intellectual property protection in general.

Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through
effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity
standards.
Our acquisition of BBVA presents us with risks and uncertainties related to the integration of the acquired business into PNC including:

–

–

The business of BBVA, including its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA USA, going forward may not perform as we currently project or in a manner consistent
with historical performance. As a result, the anticipated benefits, including estimated cost savings, of the transaction may be significantly more difficult or take
longer to achieve than expected or may not be achieved in their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events, including those that are outside of our
control.
The integration of BBVA, including its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA USA, with that of PNC and PNC Bank may be more difficult to achieve than
anticipated or have unanticipated adverse results relating to BBVA, including its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA USA, or our existing businesses. Our ability to
integrate BBVA, including its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA USA, successfully may be adversely affected by the fact that this transaction results in us
entering several geographic markets where we did not previously have any meaningful presence.

In addition to the BBVA transaction, we grow our business in part through acquisitions and new strategic initiatives. Risks and uncertainties include those presented by
the nature of the business acquired and strategic initiative, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other
markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory
issues, and the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.
Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and
revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.
Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist activities, system failures, security
breaches, cyberattacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties specifically.

Factors and Risk Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in these reports. Our forward-
looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those we may discuss elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC.
