Income Statement Highlights
Net income of $1.5 billion, or $3.36 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2023 decreased $194 million, or 11%,
compared to $1.7 billion, or $3.98 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to lower noninterest income,
net interest income and increased expenses, partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses.
• For the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023:
• Total revenue decreased $310 million, or 6%, to $5.3 billion.
• Net interest income of $3.5 billion decreased $75 million, or 2%, as higher yields on interest-earning assets
were more than offset by increased funding costs as well as lower loan and securities balances.
2 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
• Net interest margin decreased 5 basis points to 2.79% as the change in yields on interest-earning
assets was more than offset by the change in rates on funding costs.
• Noninterest income decreased $235 million, or 12%, due to lower private equity revenue, a decrease in
mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge and lower revenue from market sensitive
businesses, partially offset by seasonally higher consumer transaction volumes and increased treasury
management product revenue. The decrease also included negative Visa Class B derivative fair value
adjustments of $83 million related to litigation escrow funding and other valuation changes. The first
quarter of 2023 included negative Visa Class B derivative fair value adjustments of $45 million.
• Provision for credit losses of $146 million in the second quarter of 2023 reflected portfolio activity and changes in
macroeconomic variables. The first quarter of 2023 included a provision for credit losses of $235 million.
• Noninterest expense increased $51 million, or 2%, to $3.4 billion, primarily due to seasonally higher marketing
spend and the full quarter impact of annual employee merit increases.
Net income of $3.2 billion, or $7.34 per diluted common share, for the first six months of 2023 increased $269 million, or 9%,
compared to $2.9 billion, or $6.61 per diluted common share, for the six months ended 2022, primarily as a result of higher net interest
income, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and increased expenses.
• For the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022:
• Total revenue increased $1.1 billion, or 11%, to $10.9 billion.
• Net interest income increased $1.2 billion, or 21%, as a result of higher interest-earning asset yields and
balances, partially offset by higher funding costs.
• Net interest margin increased 42 basis points reflecting the benefit of higher yields on interestearning assets.
• Noninterest income decreased $152 million, or 4%, and included lower merger and acquisition advisory
activity.
• Provision for credit losses of $381 million for the first six months of 2023 included the impact of our updated
economic outlook and changes in portfolio composition and quality. The first six months of 2022 included a
recapture of credit losses of $172 million.
• Noninterest expense increased $277 million, or 4%, due to higher personnel costs, an increased FDIC assessment
rate and higher marketing and technology costs to support business growth.
For additional detail, see the Consolidated Income Statement Review section of this Financial Review.
Balance Sheet Highlights
Our balance sheet was strong and well positioned at June 30, 2023. In comparison to December 31, 2022:
• Total assets of $558.2 billion were stable.
• Total loans decreased $4.3 billion, or 1%, to $321.8 billion.
• Total commercial loans decreased $5.1 billion, or 2%, to $220.0 billion driven by a lower utilization of loan
commitments in addition to paydowns outpacing new production.
• Total consumer loans increased $828 million to $101.8 billion as growth in residential mortgages, automobile, home
equity and credit card loans were partially offset by declines in the remaining portfolios as paydowns outpaced new
originations.
• Investment securities decreased $3.7 billion, or 3%, to $135.7 billion, primarily due to prepayments and maturities outpacing
purchases.
• Interest-earning deposits with banks, primarily with the Federal Reserve Bank, increased $10.9 billion, or 40%, to $38.3
billion, primarily due to higher borrowed funds and a decrease in loans, partially offset by lower deposits.
• Total deposits decreased $8.8 billion, or 2%, to $427.5 billion as a result of lower consumer and commercial deposits,
reflecting seasonal declines and the impact of quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve. In addition, noninterest-bearing
balances decreased due to the continued shift into interest-bearing deposit products as interest rates have risen.
• Borrowed funds increased $6.7 billion, or 11%, to $65.4 billion due to parent company senior debt issuances and higher
FHLB borrowings.
For additional detail, see the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 3 
Credit Quality Highlights
The second quarter of 2023 reflected strong credit quality performance.
• At June 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022:
• Nonperforming assets decreased $70 million, or 3%, to $1.9 billion.
• Overall loan delinquencies of $1.2 billion decreased $278 million, or 19%, driven by lower consumer and
commercial loan delinquencies.
• The ACL related to loans, which consists of the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending related
commitments, totaled $5.4 billion at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. During the six months ended June
30, 2023, reserves reflected our updated economic outlook and changes in portfolio composition and quality. ACL
to total loans was 1.68% and 1.67% at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
• Net charge-offs of $194 million, or 0.24% of average loans, in the second quarter of 2023 were stable compared to the first
quarter of 2023.
For additional detail see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review.
Capital and Liquidity Highlights
We maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions.
• Common shareholders’ equity of $42.1 billion at June 30, 2023, increased $2.1 billion, or 5%, compared to December 31,
2022, increased due to the benefit of net income and an improvement in AOCI, partially offset by common dividends paid
and common share repurchases.
• In the second quarter of 2023, PNC returned $0.7 billion of capital to shareholders, as a result of $0.6 billion of dividends on
common shares and $0.1 billion of common share repurchases, representing 1.1 million shares.
• Consistent with the SCB framework, which allows for capital return in amounts in excess of the SCB minimum
levels, our Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase
program of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 46% were still available for repurchase at
June 30, 2023. PNC’s SCB through September 30, 2023 is 2.9%. Based on the results of the Federal Reserve’s 2023
annual stress test, PNC’s SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2023 will improve to the regulatory
minimum of 2.5%.
• On July 3, 2023, the PNC Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to $1.55 per share, an
increase of 5 cents per share. The dividend, with a payment date of August 5, 2023, will be payable the next business day.
• Our CET1 ratio increased to 9.5% at June 30, 2023 from 9.1% at December 31, 2022.
• PNC elected a five-year transition provision effective March 31, 2020 to delay until December 31, 2021 the full
impact of the CECL standard on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. Effective for the first
quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being
phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. The fully implemented ratios reflect the full impact of
CECL and exclude the benefits of this transition provision. The estimated CET1 fully implemented ratio was 9.4%
at June 30, 2023 compared to 8.9% at December 31, 2022.
• PNC’s average LCR for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was 109% and exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement
throughout the quarter.
See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for more detail on our
2023 liquidity and capital actions as well as our capital ratios.
PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding an
SCB established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process. For additional
information, see Capital Management in the Risk Management section in this Financial Review and the Supervision and Regulation
section in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Business Outlook
Statements regarding our business outlook are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be
substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account the potential impact of legal and regulatory
contingencies. These statements are based on our views that:
• The economy continued to expand in the first half of 2023, but economic growth is slowing in response to the ongoing
Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening to slow inflation. This has led to large increases in both short- and long-term
interest rates. The housing market stabilized in the first half of 2023 as the Federal Reserve signaled a potential end to its
federal funds rate hiking cycle. However, given the upward trajectory in mortgage rates and declining affordability, PNC
continues to expect slower activity in the housing market in the second half of 2023 with a recovery in early 2024 as the
4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
Federal Reserve starts cutting the federal funds rate.
• PNC’s baseline outlook is for a mild recession starting in late 2023 or early 2024, with a smaller contraction in real GDP of
less than 1%, lasting into mid-2024. The unemployment rate will increase in the second half of this year, ending 2023 at
above 4%, and then peak slightly above 5% in early 2025. Inflation will slow with weaker demand, moving back to the
Federal Reserve’s 2% objective by this time next year.
• PNC expects the federal funds rate to remain between 5.25% and 5.50% through March 2024, when it is expected that the
Federal Reserve will cut rates in response to the recession.
For the third quarter of 2023, compared to the second quarter of 2023, we expect:
• Average loans to be down approximately 1%,
• Net interest income to be down 3% to 4%,
• Noninterest income, excluding net securities gains and Visa activity, to be up 10% to 11%,
• Revenue to be up approximately 1%,
• Noninterest expense, excluding the proposed FDIC special assessment, to be stable, and
• Net loan charge-offs to be $200 million to $250 million.
For the full year 2023, compared to the full year of 2022, we expect:
• Period-end loans to be stable,
• Average loans to be up 5% to 6%,
• Net interest income to be up 5% to 6%,
• Noninterest income, excluding net securities gains and Visa activity, to be down 2% to 4%,
• Revenue to be up 2% to 2.5%,
• Noninterest expense, excluding the proposed FDIC special assessment, to be up approximately 2%, and
• The effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.
We cannot provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures to
their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and amounts
necessary for the reconciliation when such amounts are subject to events that cannot be reasonably predicted, as noted in our
Cautionary Statement. Accordingly, we cannot address the probable significance of unavailable information.
See the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors
included in our first quarter 2023 Form 10-Q and 2022 Form 10-K for other factors that could cause future events to differ, perhaps
materially, from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW
Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Item 1 of this Report.
Net income of $1.5 billion, or $3.36 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2023 decreased $194 million, or 11%,
compared to $1.7 billion, or $3.98 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to lower noninterest income,
net interest income and increased expenses, partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses. Net income of $3.2 billion, or $7.34
per diluted common share for the first six months of 2023 increased $269 million, or 9%, compared to $2.9 billion, or $6.61 per
diluted common share for the same period in 2022, primarily as a result of higher net interest income, partially offset by a higher
provision for credit losses and increased expenses.

(a) Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as
well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income
earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated
Income Statement. For more information, see Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (non-GAAP) in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section in
Item 1 of this Report.
Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and
related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical
Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis section of this Report for additional
information.
Net interest income decreased $75 million, or 2%, for the second quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2023, as higher
yields on interest-earning assets were more than offset by increased funding costs as well as lower loan and securities balances. Net
interest income increased $1.2 billion, or 21%, for the first six months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, as a result of
higher interest-earning asset yields and balances, partially offset by higher funding costs. Net interest margin decreased 5 basis points
compared to the first quarter of 2023 as the change in yields on interest-earning assets was more than offset by the change in rates on
funding costs. Net interest margin increased 42 basis points in the year-to-date comparison reflecting the benefit of higher yields on
interest-earning assets.
6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
Average investment securities for the second quarter of 2023 decreased $2.4 billion, or 2% compared to the first quarter of 2023
primarily due to prepayments and maturities outpacing purchases. Average investment securities increased $7.9 billion, or 6% in the
year-to-date comparison, due to net securities purchases, primarily of agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Average
investment securities represented 28% of average interest-earning assets for both the second and first quarters of 2023, and 28% for
the first six months of 2023 compared to 27% for the first six months of 2022.
Average loans for the second quarter of 2023 were stable compared to the first quarter of 2023. Average loans increased $27.2 billion,
or 9% in the year-to-date comparison, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Average loans represented 64% of
average interest-earning assets for both the second and first quarters of 2023, and 64% for the first six months of 2023 compared to
60% for the first six months of 2022.
Average interest-earning deposits with banks for the second quarter of 2023 decreased $2.6 billion, or 8%, compared to the first
quarter of 2023, reflecting lower deposit balances. In the year-to-date comparison, average interest-earning deposits with banks
decreased $18.4 billion, or 36%, primarily due to higher loan balances and lower deposits, partially offset by higher borrowed funds.
Average interest-bearing deposits for the second quarter of 2023 decreased $2.5 billion, or 1%, compared to the first quarter of 2023,
reflecting increased consumer spending, the impact of quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve and consumer tax payments.
Average interest-bearing deposits increased $15.5 billion, or 5%, in the year-to-date comparison, reflecting the continued shift from
noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing as deposit rates have risen. In total, average interest-bearing deposits represented 83% of
average interest-bearing liabilities for both the second and first quarters of 2023 and 83% for the first six months of 2023 compared to
90%, for the first six months of 2022.
Average borrowed funds increased $2.7 billion, or 4%, and $31.3 billion, or 95% in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons,
respectively. The increase in both comparisons was due to higher FHLB borrowings and parent company senior debt issuances.
Further details regarding average loans and deposits are included in the Business Segments Review section of this Financial Review.

Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 34% for the second quarter of 2023 compared to 36% for the first quarter of
2023, and 35% for the first six months of 2023 compared to 40% for the same period in 2022.
Asset management and brokerage fees decreased compared to the first quarter of 2023, and included lower annuity sales. The decrease
in the year-to-date comparison reflected the impact of lower average equity markets and annuity sales. PNC’s discretionary client
assets under management of $176 billion at June 30, 2023 decreased from $177 billion at March 31, 2023, and included the impact of
client activity, partially offset by higher spot equity markets. PNC’s discretionary client assets under management increased from $167
billion at June 30, 2022, driven by higher spot equity markets, partially offset by client activity.
Capital markets and advisory fees decreased compared to the first quarter of 2023 driven by lower merger and acquisition advisory
fees and a decline in loan syndication revenue. The decrease in the year-to-date comparison was primarily due to lower merger and
acquisition advisory fees.
Card and cash management revenue increased compared to the first quarter of 2023, reflecting seasonally higher consumer transaction
volumes and increased treasury management product revenue. The increase compared to the first six months of 2022 was due to
increased treasury management product revenue and higher customer transaction volumes.
Lending and deposit services decreased compared to the first quarter of 2023 and increased in the year-to-date comparison, reflecting
client-related activity. In comparison to the first six months of 2022, the increase was also driven by growth in loan commitment fees.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 7 
Residential and commercial mortgage decreased compared to the first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a $58 million decrease in
mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge. The decrease compared to the first six months of 2022 was driven by
lower commercial mortgage banking activities.
Other noninterest income decreased in the quarterly comparison and was stable in the year-to-date comparison. Both comparisons
included lower private equity revenue and the impact of negative Visa Class B derivative fair value adjustments related to litigation
escrow funding and other valuation changes. Negative Visa Class B fair value adjustments were $83 million for the second quarter of
2023 compared to $45 million for the first quarter of 2023, and $128 million for the first six months of 2023 compared to $12 million
for the same period in 2022.

Noninterest expense increased compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to seasonally higher marketing spend and the full
quarter impact of annual employee merit increases. The increase compared to the first six months of 2022 was due to higher personnel
costs, an increased FDIC assessment rate and higher marketing and technology costs to support business growth.
In July 2023, we raised our continuous improvement program savings goal from $400 million to $450 million for 2023.
We expect the FDIC will enact a special deposit insurance assessment in the second half of 2023 that will significantly increase our
FDIC deposit insurance costs. Based on the current proposal, PNC estimates our total cost to be approximately $468 million pre-tax,
or $370 million after-tax, which would be incurred in the quarter the FDIC finalizes the rule. The total cost and timing is subject to
change pending the assessment’s finalization. See the Recent Regulatory Developments section in this Financial Review and Note 16
Regulatory Matters for additional details on this FDIC special deposit insurance assessment.
Effective Income Tax Rate
The effective income tax rate was 15.5% in the second quarter of 2023, compared to 17.2% in the first quarter of 2023, and 16.4% in
the first six months of 2023 compared to 17.9% for the same period in 2022. The second quarter of 2023 included the favorable impact
of certain tax matters.

Our balance sheet was strong and well positioned at June 30, 2023. In comparison to December 31, 2022:
• Total assets were stable.
• Total liabilities decreased due to lower deposits, partially offset by increased borrowed funds.
• Total equity increased due to the benefit of net income, a preferred stock issuance and an improvement in AOCI, partially
offset by dividends paid and common share repurchases.
The ACL related to loans totaled $5.4 billion at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. During the six months ended June 30,
2023, reserves reflected our updated economic outlook and changes in portfolio composition and quality. See the following for
additional information regarding our ACL related to loans:
• Allowance for Credit Losses in the Credit Risk Management section of this Financial Review,
• Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section of this Financial Review, and

Investment Securities
Investment securities of $135.7 billion at June 30, 2023 decreased $3.7 billion, or 3%, compared to December 31, 2022, primarily due
to prepayments and maturities outpacing purchases.
The level and composition of the investment securities portfolio fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market
conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. We manage our investment securities portfolio to
optimize returns, while providing a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering the LCR, NSFR and
other internal and external guidelines and constraints.

(a) Of our total securities portfolio, 97% were rated AAA/AA at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
(b) Amortized cost is presented net of the allowance for investment securities, which totaled $148 million at June 30, 2023 and primarily related to non-agency commercial
mortgage-backed securities. The comparable amount at December 31, 2022 was $149 million.
(c) Collateralized primarily by office buildings, multifamily housing, retail properties, lodging properties and industrial properties.
(d) Collateralized primarily by corporate debt, government guaranteed education loans and other consumer credit products.
(e) Includes state and municipal securities.
(f) Includes available for sale and held to maturity securities, which are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value and amortized cost, respectively.
Table 9 presents our investment securities portfolio by amortized cost and fair value. The relationship of fair value to amortized cost at
June 30, 2023 was comparable to December 31, 2022 due primarily to the impact of higher interest rates on the valuation of fixed-rate
securities offset by the passage of time. We continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and maintain the allowance for
investment securities at an appropriate level to absorb expected credit losses on our investment securities portfolio for the remaining
contractual term of the securities adjusted for expected prepayments. See Note 2 Investment Securities for additional details regarding
the allowance for investment securities.
The duration of investment securities was 4.3 years and 4.5 years at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We estimate
that at June 30, 2023 the effective duration of investment securities was 4.3 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in
interest rates and 4.3 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at December 31,
2022 for the effective duration of investment securities were 4.4 years and 4.5 years, respectively.
Based on expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio was 5.7 years at
June 30, 2023 compared to 6.0 years at December 31, 2022.

Total deposits decreased as a result of lower consumer and commercial deposits, reflecting seasonal declines and the impact of
quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve. In addition, noninterest-bearing balances decreased due to the continued shift into
interest-bearing deposit products as interest rates have risen.
Borrowed funds increased due to parent company senior debt issuances and higher FHLB borrowings.
The level and composition of borrowed funds fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan,
investment securities and deposit growth and capital considerations. We manage our borrowed funds to provide a reliable source of
liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering our LCR and NSFR requirements and other internal and external guidelines
and constraints. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Financial Review for
additional information regarding our liquidity and capital activities. See Note 7 Borrowed Funds in this Report and Note 10 Borrowed

Shareholders’ Equity
Total shareholders’ equity was $49.3 billion at June 30, 2023, an increase of $3.5 billion compared to December 31, 2022, as increases
related to net income of $3.2 billion, a preferred stock issuance of $1.5 billion and an improvement in AOCI of $0.6 billion were
partially offset by dividends paid of $1.4 billion and common share repurchases of $0.5 billion.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEW
We have three reportable business segments:
• Retail Banking
• Corporate & Institutional Banking
• Asset Management Group
Business segment results and a description of each business are included in Note 14 Segment Reporting. Certain amounts included in
this Business Segments Review differ from those amounts shown in Note 14, primarily due to the presentation in this Financial
Review of business net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.
Net interest income in business segment results reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding
charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing
characteristics, tenor and other factors.
Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in the
“Other” category as shown in Table 79 in Note 14 Segment Reporting. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria
for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities, including net securities gains or
losses, ACL for investment securities, certain trading activities, certain runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments,
intercompany eliminations, certain corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments, exited businesses
and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP).

Retail Banking
Retail Banking’s core strategy is to build lifelong, primary relationships by creating a sense of financial well-being and ease for our
clients. Over time, we seek to deepen those relationships by meeting the broad range of our clients’ financial needs across savings,
liquidity, lending, payments, investment and retirement solutions. We work to deliver these solutions in the most seamless and
efficient way possible, meeting our customers where they want to be met – whether in a branch, through digital channels, at an ATM
or through our phone-based customer contact centers – while continuously optimizing the cost to sell and service. We believe that,
over time, we can grow our customer base, enhance the breadth and depth of our client relationships and improve our efficiency
through differentiated products and leading digital channels.

Retail Banking earnings for the first six months of 2023 increased $939 million compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to
increased net interest income, partially offset by an increased provision for credit losses and lower noninterest income.
Net interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits, partially offset by
narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans.
Noninterest income decreased primarily due to the impact of higher negative Visa Class B fair value adjustments compared to the
same period in 2022.
Provision for credit losses included the impact of our updated economic outlook and changes in portfolio composition and quality.
Noninterest expense increased, and included increased technology costs and higher marketing spend, partially offset by lower noncredit losses and personnel.
Retail Banking average total loans increased in the first six months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Average consumer
loans increased 5% driven by higher residential real estate and home equity loans as a result of new volume and draws on existing
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 15 
accounts outpacing liquidations, as well as growth in credit card loans due to new account production and purchase volume increases.
The increase was partially offset by a decline in automobile, education and other consumer loans as paydowns outpaced new
originations. Average commercial loans increased due to growth in automobile dealer segment balances, partially offset by forgiveness
of PPP loans.
Our focus on growing primary customer relationships is at the core of our deposit strategy in Retail, which is based on attracting and
retaining stable, low-cost deposits as a key funding source for PNC. We have taken a disciplined approach to pricing, focused on
retaining relationship-based balances and executing on targeted deposit growth and retention strategies aimed at more rate sensitive
customers. Our goal with regard to deposits is to optimize balances, economics and long-term customer growth. In the first six months
of 2023, average total deposits decreased compared to the same period in 2022, reflecting the impact of increased consumer spending
and quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve.
As part of our strategic focus on growing customers and meeting their financial needs, we have established a coast-to-coast network of
retail branches, solution centers and ATMs that operate alongside PNC’s suite of digital capabilities.
Retail Banking continues to enhance the customer experience with refinements to product and service offerings that drive value for
consumers and small businesses.

to conform to the current period presentation.
Corporate & Institutional Banking earnings in the first six months of 2023 decreased $83 million compared to the same period in 2022
driven by higher provision for credit losses, increased noninterest expense and lower noninterest income, partially offset by higher net
interest income.
Net interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits and higher
average loan balances, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans and lower average deposit balances.
Noninterest income decreased in the comparison driven by lower capital markets and advisory fees and lower commercial mortgage
banking activities, partially offset by growth in treasury management product revenue.
Provision for credit losses included the impact of our updated economic outlook and changes in portfolio composition and quality.
Noninterest expense increased in the comparison due to continued investments to support business growth and the impact of a higher
FDIC assessment rate.
Average loans increased compared with the six months ended June 30, 2022 due to increases in Corporate Banking, Real Estate and
Business Credit, partially offset by a decrease in Commercial Banking:
• Corporate Banking provides lending, equipment finance, treasury management and capital markets products and services to
mid-sized and large corporations, and government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business increased driven
by strong new production throughout 2022 and higher average utilization of loan commitments.
• Real Estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Average
loans for this business increased largely due to new production throughout 2022, partially offset by a lower average
utilization of loan commitments.
• Business Credit provides asset-based lending and equipment financing solutions. The loan and lease portfolio is relatively
high yielding, with acceptable risk as the loans are mainly secured by business assets. Average loans for this business
increased primarily driven by new production, partially offset by lower average utilization of loan commitments.
• Commercial Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets related products and services to smaller
corporations and businesses. Average loans for this business declined primarily driven by PPP loan forgiveness and lower
average utilization of loan commitments.
The deposit strategy of Corporate & Institutional Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining
relationship-based balances over time, executing on customer and segment-specific deposit growth strategies and continuing to
provide funding and liquidity to PNC. Average total deposits decreased compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting
the impact of quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve. We continue to actively monitor the interest rate environment and make
adjustments to our deposit strategy in response to evolving market conditions, bank funding needs and client relationship dynamics.
Following the BBVA acquisition in 2021 and our de novo expansion efforts, we are now a coast-to-coast franchise and have a
presence in the largest 30 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas. These expanded locations complement Corporate & Institutional
Banking’s existing national businesses with a significant presence in these cities, and our full suite of commercial products and
services are offered nationally.
Product Revenue
In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including
treasury management, capital markets and advisory products and services and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers
of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income and
noninterest income, as appropriate. From a business perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is
reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results, and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses
where the customer relationship exists. The Other Information section in Table 13 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for
treasury management and commercial mortgage banking services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services
follows.
The Treasury Management business provides corporations with cash and investment management services, receivables and
disbursement management services, funds transfer services, international payment services and access to online/mobile information
management and reporting services. Treasury management revenue is reported in noninterest income and net interest income.
Noninterest income includes treasury management product revenue less earnings credits provided to customers on compensating
18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
deposit balances used to pay for products and services. Net interest income includes funding credit from all treasury management
customer deposit balances. Compared to the first six months of 2022, treasury management revenue increased due to wider interest
rate spreads on the value of deposits and higher product revenue.
Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (both net interest income and
noninterest income), revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and hedges related to those activities. Total
revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities decreased in the comparison primarily due to lower commercial mortgage
servicing income.
Capital markets and advisory includes services and activities primarily related to merger and acquisition advisory, equity capital
markets advisory, asset-backed financing, loan syndication, securities underwriting and customer-related trading. The decrease in
capital markets and advisory fees in the comparison was mostly driven by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees, partially offset
by higher customer-related trading revenue for derivatives, foreign exchange and fixed income.

Institutional Asset Management provides outsourced chief investment officer, custody, cash and fixed income client solutions, and
retirement plan fiduciary investment services to institutional clients, including corporations, healthcare systems, insurance companies,
municipalities and non-profits.
Asset Management Group earnings in the first six months of 2023 decreased $73 million compared to the same period in 2022,
primarily driven by higher noninterest expense, lower net interest income and a decrease in noninterest income.
Net interest income decreased in the comparison due to a decline in average deposits as well as narrower interest rate spreads on the
value of loans.
Noninterest income decreased in the comparison and is primarily attributable to the asset management fee impact from lower average
equity markets and the impact of client activity.
Noninterest expense increased in the comparison reflecting continued investments to support business growth.
Discretionary client assets under management increased in comparison to the prior year, primarily due to higher equity markets as of
June 30, 2023.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Risk Management section included in Item 7 of our 2022 Form 10-K describes our enterprise risk management framework,
including risk culture, enterprise strategy, risk governance and oversight framework, risk identification, risk assessments, risk controls
and monitoring, and risk aggregation and reporting. Additionally, our 2022 Form 10-K provides an analysis of the firm’s Capital
Management and our key areas of risk, which include, but are not limited to, Credit, Market, Liquidity and Operational (including
Compliance and Information Security).
Credit Risk Management
Credit risk, including our credit risk management processes, is described in further detail in the Credit Risk Management section of
our 2022 Form 10-K. The following provides additional information around our loan portfolio, which is our most significant

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 21 
Commercial
Commercial and Industrial
Commercial and industrial loans comprised 55% and 56% of our total loan portfolio at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
respectively. The majority of our commercial and industrial loans are secured by collateral that provides a secondary source of
repayment for a loan should a borrower experience cash generation difficulties. Examples of this collateral include short-term assets,
such as accounts receivable, inventory and securities, and long-lived assets, such as equipment, owner-occupied real estate and other
business assets.
We actively manage our commercial and industrial loans to assess any changes (both positive and negative) in the level of credit risk
at both the borrower and portfolio level. To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign internal risk ratings reflecting our estimates of
the borrower’s PD and LGD for each related credit facility. This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity
in the risk monitoring process and is updated on an ongoing basis through our credit risk management processes. In addition to
monitoring the level of credit risk, we also monitor concentrations of credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and geographies
that may exist in our portfolio. Our commercial and industrial portfolio is well-diversified across industries as shown in the following
table (based on the North American Industry Classification System).

Commercial Real Estate
Commercial real estate loans comprised $22.1 billion related to commercial mortgages on income-producing properties, $7.2 billion of
real estate construction project loans and $6.6 billion of intermediate-term financing loans as of June 30, 2023. Comparable amounts
as of December 31, 2022 were $22.3 billion, $6.4 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively.
We monitor credit risk associated with our commercial real estate loans similar to commercial and industrial loans by analyzing PD
and LGD. Additionally, risks associated with commercial real estate loans tend to be correlated to the loan structure, collateral location
and quality, project progress and business environment. These attributes are also monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk. The
portfolio is geographically diverse due to the nature of our business involving clients throughout the U.S.

As remote work continues to be a feasible alternative and notable portions of leased space remain unoccupied, real estate related to the
office sector is an area of continuing uncertainty. We continue to closely monitor and manage our office portfolio for elevated levels
of credit risk given the ongoing shift in office demand.
At June 30, 2023, our outstanding loan balances in the office portfolio totaled $8.7 billion, or 2.7% of total loans, while additional
unfunded loan commitments totaled $0.4 billion. Nonperforming loans totaled 3.3% of total office loans outstanding at June 30, 2023,
while criticized loans totaled 22.5% of this portfolio. At June 30, 2023, there were no office loans outstanding that were 30 or more
days delinquent. We have established reserves against these loans that we believe appropriately reflect the expected credit losses in the
portfolio as of June 30, 2023.
Our office portfolio is well diversified geographically across our coast-to-coast franchise. From a tenancy category perspective, 57%
of this portfolio represents multi-tenant properties at June 30, 2023, which is an area where we have noted increased stress. The
remaining 43% of the portfolio is comprised of single-tenant, government tenant, and medical office tenant.
Consumer
Residential Real Estate
Residential real estate loans primarily consisted of residential mortgage loans at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
We obtain loan attributes at origination, including FICO scores and LTVs, and we update these and other credit metrics at least
quarterly. We track borrower performance monthly. We also segment the mortgage portfolio into pools based on product type (e.g.,
nonconforming or conforming). This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk
analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and
bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and geographic concentrations.

We originate residential mortgage loans nationwide through our national mortgage business as well as within our branch network.
Residential mortgage loans underwritten to agency standards, including conforming loan amount limits, are typically sold with
servicing retained by us. We also originate nonconforming residential mortgage loans that do not meet agency standards, which we
retain on our balance sheet. Our portfolio of originated nonconforming residential mortgage loans totaled $41.6 billion at June 30,
2023 with 45% located in California. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2022 were $40.6 billion and 44%, respectively.
Home Equity
Home equity loans comprised $20.2 billion of home equity lines of credit and $6.0 billion of closed-end home equity installment loans
at June 30, 2023. Comparable amounts were $19.5 billion and $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, respectively. Home equity lines
of credit are a variable interest rate product with fixed rate conversion options available to certain borrowers.
Similar to residential real estate loans, we track borrower performance of this portfolio on a monthly basis. We also segment the
population into pools based on product type (e.g., home equity loans, legacy brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit,
or legacy brokered home equity lines of credit) and track the historical performance of any related mortgage loans regardless of
whether we hold such liens. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk analysis
and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy
status, FICO scores, LTV, lien position and geographic concentration.
The credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we hold the first lien position is superior to the portion of
the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien. Lien position information is generally determined at
the time of origination and monitored on an ongoing basis for risk management purposes. We use a third-party service provider to
obtain updated loan information, including lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.

Comparable amounts as of December 31, 2022 were $13.7 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The indirect auto portfolio consists of
loans originated primarily through franchised dealers, including from expansion into newer markets. This business is strategically

noted in Table 20. We offer both new and used auto financing to customers through our various channels. At June 30, 2023, the
portfolio balance was composed of 48% new vehicle loans and 52% used vehicle loans. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2022
were 50% and 50%, respectively.
The auto loan portfolio’s performance is measured monthly, including updated collateral values that are obtained monthly and updated
FICO scores that are obtained at least quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product
channel and product type and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience. As part of our overall risk analysis and
monitoring, we segment the portfolio by geography, channel, collateral attributes and credit metrics which include FICO score, LTV
and term.

principal and interest is not probable and include nonperforming loans whose terms were modified as a result of a borrower’s financial
difficulty and PCD loans, OREO and foreclosed assets. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans and loans
accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. See Note 1 Accounting Policies of this Report for
details on our nonaccrual policies.
The following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets by major category:

(a) In connection with the adoption of ASU 2022-02 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, nonperforming
loans as of June 30, 2023 include certain loans where terms were modified as a result of a borrower’s financial difficulty. Prior period amounts included nonperforming
TDRs, for which accounting guidance was eliminated effective January 1, 2023. See Note 1 Accounting Policies and the Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing
Financial Difficulty section of Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for more information on our adoption of this ASU.
(b) Excludes most unsecured consumer loans and lines of credit, which are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and are not placed on nonperforming status.
(c) Calculated excluding allowances for investment securities and other financial assets.
The following table provides details on the change in nonperforming assets for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:

June 30 $ 1,949 $ 2,075
As of June 30, 2023, approximately 98% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral, which lessened reserve requirements
and is expected to reduce credit losses.
Loan Delinquencies
We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels are a key indicator of credit quality in our loan portfolio.
Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of
payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies include government insured or guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under
the fair value option and PCD loans. Amounts exclude loans held for sale.
We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, repayment sources, underlying collateral, and other support given
current events, economic conditions and expectations. We refine our practices to meet the changing environment resulting from
elevated inflation levels, labor-related supply chain pressures, higher interest rates and structural and secular changes fostered by the
pandemic. To mitigate losses and enhance customer support, we offer loan modifications and collection programs to assist our
26 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
customers. Under the CARES Act credit reporting rules, certain loans modified due to pandemic related hardships are not being
reported as past due as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 based on the contractual terms of the loan, even where borrowers
may not be making payments on their loans during the modification period. The CARES Act credit reporting rules expire in the third
quarter of 2023.
The following table presents a summary of accruing loans past due by delinquency status:

Total accruing loans past due $ 1,212 $ 1,490 $ (278) (19) % 0.38 % 0.46 %
(a) Past due loan amounts include government insured or guaranteed loans of $0.4 billion at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
The decrease in accruing loans past due from December 31, 2022 was the result of lower delinquencies in both the consumer and
commercial portfolios.
Accruing loans past due 90 days or more continue to accrue interest because they are (i) well secured by collateral and are in the
process of collection, (ii) managed in homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines,
or (iii) certain government insured or guaranteed loans. As such, they are excluded from nonperforming loans.
Loan Modifications
We provide relief to our customers experiencing financial hardships through a variety of solutions. Commercial loan and lease
modifications are based on each individual borrower’s situation, while consumer loan modifications are evaluated under our hardship
relief programs.
On January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-02 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and
Vintage Disclosures, which eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs and enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan
modifications when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Refer to Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 3 Loans and Related
Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information on our adoption of this ASU.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and
supportable forecasts of future conditions and other relevant factors, including current borrower and/or transaction characteristics. We
maintain the ACL at an appropriate level for expected losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases,
other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments and determine this allowance based on assessments of the remaining
estimated contractual term as of the balance sheet date.
See Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional discussion of our ACL, including details of our methodologies. Also see the Critical
Accounting Estimates and Judgments section of this Report for further discussion of the assumptions used in the determination of the
ACL as of June 30, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Management
Liquidity risk, including our liquidity monitoring measures and tools, is described in further detail in the Liquidity and Capital
Management section of our 2022 Form 10-K.
One of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by reference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure
that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a hypothetical
30-day stress scenario. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR daily and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of 100%. The
LCR for each of PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement throughout the second quarter of 2023.
Fluctuations in our average LCR result from changes to the components of the calculation, including high-quality liquid assets and net
cash outflows, as a result of ongoing business activity.
The NSFR is designed to measure the stability of the maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a oneyear time horizon. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the NSFR on an ongoing basis and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of
100%. The NSFR for each of PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement throughout the second quarter of
2023.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 29 
We provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on us in the Supervision and
Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2022 Form 10-K.
Sources of Liquidity
Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. These
deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost funding. Total deposits decreased to $427.5 billion at June 30, 2023 from $436.3
billion at December 31, 2022, and included a continued shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposit products, as interest
rates have risen. As of June 30, 2023, uninsured deposits represented approximately 46% of our total deposit base. The majority of our
uninsured deposits are related to commercial operating and relationship accounts, which we define as commercial deposit customers
who utilize two or more PNC products. See the Funding Sources portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review and Business
Segments Review sections of this Financial Review for additional information on our deposits and related strategies.
We also obtain liquidity through various forms of funding, including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and FHLB
borrowings) and short-term borrowings (securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term
borrowings). See the Funding Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in this Financial Review, Note 7 Borrowed
Funds included in this Report and Note 10 Borrowed Funds in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional information related to our
borrowings.
Total senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, increased due to the following activity:

In billions 2023
January 1 $ 23.0
Issuances 6.2
Calls and maturities (1.5)
Other (0.1)
June 30 $ 27.6
Additionally, certain liquid assets and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to manage our liquidity
position. The following table summarizes our contingent liquidity from on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources:
Table 27:Contingent Liquidity Sources
Dollars in billions June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022

Total available contingent liquidity $ 227.3 $ 203.9
(a) Available investment securities represents the fair value of investment securities that are available for sale or that can be used for pledging or to secure other sources of funding.
Bank Liquidity
Under PNC Bank’s 2014 bank note program, as amended, PNC Bank may from time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate
principal amount outstanding at any one time of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine
months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes) from their date of issue. At June 30,
2023, PNC Bank had $7.0 billion of notes outstanding under this program of which $3.9 billion were senior notes and $3.1 billion
were subordinated notes.
Under PNC Bank’s 2013 commercial paper program, PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to
provide additional liquidity. At June 30, 2023, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.
Additionally, PNC Bank may also access funding from the parent company through deposits placed at the bank or through issuing its
senior unsecured notes.
Parent Company Liquidity
In addition to managing liquidity risk at the bank level, we monitor the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s contractual
obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the
parent company maintains liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases
and acquisitions.
30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
At June 30, 2023, available parent company liquidity totaled $17.2 billion. Parent company liquidity is held in intercompany cash and
investments. For investments with longer durations, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity
of parent company debt obligations.
The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends or other capital distributions it receives from PNC Bank, which may
be impacted by the following:
• Bank-level capital needs,
• Laws, regulations and the results of supervisory activities,
• Corporate policies,
• Contractual restrictions, and
• Other factors.
There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to
extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. The amount available for dividend payments by PNC Bank to the
parent company without prior regulatory approval was $5.2 billion at June 30, 2023. See Note 20 Regulatory Matters in our 2022
Form 10-K for further discussion of these limitations.
In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends
and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. We can also generate liquidity for
the parent company and PNC’s non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital
instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. Under the parent company’s 2014 commercial paper program, the
parent company has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. At June 30, 2023, there
were no issuances outstanding under this program.
The following table details Parent Company note issuances in the second quarter of 2023:
Table 28: Parent Company Notes Issued
Issuance Date Amount Description of Issuance
June 12, 2023 $1.0 billion $1.0 billion of senior fixed-to-floating notes with a maturity date of June 12, 2026. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears at a fixed rate of 5.812% per annum, on June 12 and December 12 of each year, beginning
on December 12, 2023. Beginning on June 12, 2025, interest is payable quarterly in arrears at a floating rate
per annum equal to Compounded SOFR (determined with respect to each quarterly interest period using the
SOFR Index as described in the Prospectus Supplement), plus 1.322%, on September 12, 2025, December 12,
2025, March 12, 2026 and at the maturity date.
June 12, 2023 $2.5 billion $2.5 billion of senior fixed-to-floating notes with a maturity date of June 12, 2029. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears at a fixed rate of 5.582% per annum, on June 12 and December 12 of each year, beginning
on December 12, 2023. Beginning on June 12, 2028, interest is payable quarterly in arrears at a floating rate
per annum equal to Compounded SOFR (determined with respect to each quarterly interest period using the
SOFR Index as described in the Prospectus Supplement), plus 1.841%, on September 12, 2028, December 12,
2028, March 12, 2029 and at the maturity date.
Parent company senior and subordinated debt outstanding totaled $19.2 billion and $13.1 billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31,
2022, respectively.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We have contractual obligations representing required future payments on borrowed funds, time deposits, leases, pension and
postretirement benefits and purchase obligations. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section
of our 2022 Form 10-K for more information on these future cash outflows. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we have
various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We provide information on
our commitments in Note 8 Commitments.
Credit Ratings
PNC’s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain derivative
instruments and the ability to offer certain products.
In general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset
quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied
government support. A decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and/or increase the
cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition.

Capital Management
Detailed information on our capital management processes and activities is included in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item
1 of our 2022 Form 10-K.
We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming
debt, issuing equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions or repurchases, and
managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.
In the second quarter of 2023, PNC returned $0.7 billion of capital to shareholders, as a result of $0.6 billion of dividends on common
shares and $0.1 billion of common share repurchases, representing 1.1 million shares. Consistent with the SCB framework, which
allows for capital return in amounts in excess of the SCB minimum levels (the regulatory minimum (4.5%) plus our SCB), our Board
of Directors has authorized a repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase program of up to 100 million common
shares, of which approximately 46% were still available for repurchase at June 30, 2023. PNC’s SCB through September 30, 2023 is
2.9%. Based on the results of the Federal Reserve’s 2023 annual stress test, PNC’s SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October
1, 2023 will improve to the regulatory minimum of 2.5%.
Due to the proposed rules issued by the Federal banking agencies on July 27, 2023 to adjust the Basel III capital framework, share
repurchase activity is expected to be reduced in the third quarter of 2023 compared to recent prior quarters. PNC continues to evaluate
and may adjust share repurchase activity, as actual amounts and timing are dependent on market and economic conditions, as well as
other factors.
On July 3, 2023, the PNC Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to $1.55 per share, an increase of 5
cents per share. The dividend, with a payment date of August 5, 2023, will be payable the next business day.

(a) The ratios are calculated to reflect PNC’s election to adopt the CECL five-year transition provisions. Effective for the first quarter 2022, PNC is now in the three-year
transition period and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024.
(b) The ratios are calculated to reflect the full impact of CECL and exclude the benefits of the optional five-year transition.
(c) As permitted, PNC and PNC Bank have elected to exclude AOCI related to both available for sale securities and pension and other post-retirement plans from CET1 capital.
(d) Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets.
(e) The Supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure, which takes into account the quarterly average of both
on balance sheet assets as well as certain off-balance sheet items, including loan commitments and potential future exposure under derivative contracts.
(f) All ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC and calculated based on the standardized approach.
(g) Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Average quarterly adjusted total assets.
PNC’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. Under
the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight.
Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, nonaccruals, FDMs, past due exposures and equity exposures are generally subject
to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.
The regulatory agencies have adopted a rule permitting certain banks, including PNC, to delay the estimated impact on regulatory
capital stemming from implementing CECL. CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the change in
retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date, excluding the allowance for
PCD loans, compared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition
period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. See additional
discussion of this rule in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2022 Form 10-K.
At June 30, 2023, PNC and PNC Bank were considered “well capitalized” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio
requirements. To qualify as “well capitalized,” PNC must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based capital and
10% for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier 1 riskbased capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%. For more
information on the interagency proposed expanded risk-based capital rules, see the Recent Regulatory Developments section.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 33 
Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital
well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient
to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage
our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and we believe that our June 30, 2023 capital levels were aligned with them.
We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on us in the
Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2022 Form 10-K.
Market Risk Management
See the Market Risk Management portion of the Risk Management Section in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding
market risk.
Market Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors,
including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the
interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due
to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only
affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.
Our Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our market risk-related risk
management policies, which are approved by management’s Asset and Liability Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board of
Directors.
Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the second quarters of 2023 and 2022 follow:

Net Interest Income Sensitivity Simulation
Effect on net interest income in first year from gradual parallel interest rate change over the
 following 12 months of:
100 basis point increase 0.0 % 3.2 %
100 basis point decrease 0.0 % (3.4) %
Effect on net interest income in second year from gradual parallel interest rate change over the
 preceding 12 months of:
100 basis point increase 1.4 % 5.6 %
100 basis point decrease (1.6) % (6.4) %
In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the
effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. Table 32 reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the
next two twelve-month periods, assuming (i) the PNC Economist’s most likely rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates, and
(iii) yield curve slope flattening (a 100 basis point yield curve slope flattening between one-month and ten-year rates superimposed on
current base rates) scenario.
All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to
remain unchanged over the forecast horizon.

When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and
characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing on- and off-balance sheet positions. These assumptions determine the
future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in Tables
31 and 32. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then-current market rates.

The following graph presents the SOFR curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward:
Table 33: Alternate Interest Rate Scenarios: One Year Forward
The second quarter 2023 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to benefit from an
increase in interest rates over the longer term and an upward sloping interest rate yield curve. We believe that we have the deposit
funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and market
conditions.
Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk
We engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging
activities. These transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are
marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities. We do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.
We use VaR as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is used to estimate
the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. VaR is calculated for each of the
portfolios that comprise our customer-related trading activities of which the majority are covered positions as defined by the Market
Risk Rule. VaR is computed with positions and market risk factors updated daily to ensure each portfolio is operating within its
acceptable limits. See the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk section of our 2022 Form 10-K for more
information on our models used to calculate VaR and our backtesting process.
Customer-related trading revenue was $107 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to $198 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease was mainly due to higher funding costs on the trading positions inventory and lower
derivative client sales revenues, partially offset by improved foreign exchange client revenues.
Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment Risk
Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to
extending credit, taking deposits, underwriting securities and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in
a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also
have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity, consistent with regulatory
limitations. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets are directly affected by changes in market factors.
Various PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment
decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.

Tax Credit Investments
Included in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated entities. These tax
credit investment balances included unfunded commitments totaling $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31,
2022, respectively. These unfunded commitments are included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Note 5 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our 2022 Form 10-K has further information on tax credit
investments.
Private Equity and Other
The largest component of our other equity investments is our private equity portfolio. The private equity portfolio is an illiquid
portfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity
investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $1.8 billion at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. As of
June 30, 2023, $1.6 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and $0.2 billion was invested indirectly through various
private equity funds.
Included in our other equity investments are Visa Class B common shares, which are recorded at cost. Visa Class B common shares
that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into shares of the publicly-traded Class A
common shares, which cannot happen until the resolution of the pending interchange litigation. Based upon the June 30, 2023 per
share closing price of $237.48 for a Visa Class A common share, the estimated value of our total investment in the Class B common
shares was approximately $1.3 billion at the current conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares, while our cost basis was
insignificant. See Note 15 Fair Value and Note 21 Legal Proceedings in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our
Visa agreements. The estimated value does not represent fair value of the Visa B common shares given the shares’ limited
transferability and the lack of observable transactions in the marketplace.
We also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with
both traditional and alternative investment strategies. Net gains related to these investments were $19 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2023 and $23 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022.
Financial Derivatives
We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to
market (primarily interest rate) and credit risk inherent in our business activities. We also enter into derivatives with customers to
facilitate their risk management activities.
Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually
require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a
notional and an underlying as specified in the contract. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less
than the notional amount on these instruments.
Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 15 Fair Value and Note 16 Financial
Derivatives in our 2022 Form 10-K and in Note 11 Fair Value and Note 12 Financial Derivatives in this Report.
Not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be
ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.
LIBOR Transition
The cessation after June 30, 2023 of the requirement that banks submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR presents risks to the
financial instruments originated, held or serviced by PNC that use LIBOR as a reference rate. For more discussion regarding the
transition from LIBOR, see Item 1 Risk Factors and the Risk Management section in Item 7 of our 2022 Form 10-K.
As previously announced, PNC’s Series O, Series R and Series S preferred stock will transition to three-month CME Term SOFR plus
a tenor spread adjustment of 0.26161% per annum (“Adjusted three-month CME Term SOFR”) as the replacement reference rate.
Adjusted three-month CME Term SOFR will be used with respect to applicable floating-rate dividend periods with dividend
36 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
determination dates occurring after June 30, 2023. The calculation of interest on the junior subordinated debentures issued by The
PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and owned by PNC Capital Trust C, a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of The PNC Financial
Services Group, Inc., as well as the calculation of distributions on the trust preferred securities issued by PNC Capital Trust C will
transition to a replacement reference rate of Adjusted three-month CME Term SOFR for interest or distribution periods, as applicable,
with determination dates occurring after June 30, 2023. Further, two series of debt securities issued by a predecessor banking
subsidiary, National City Bank, will also transition the calculation of interest. The National City Bank Notes due April 1, 2043 will
use Adjusted three-month CME Term SOFR as the replacement reference rate for interest periods with determination dates occurring
after June 30, 2023. The National City Bank Notes due April 1, 2037 will use one-month CME Term SOFR plus a tenor spread
adjustment of 0.11448% per annum as the replacement reference rate with respect to interest periods with determination dates
occurring after June 30, 2023.
As of June 30, 2023, PNC had approximately $32.1 billion in loans and securities and $347.8 billion notional value in derivatives tied
to LIBOR. The vast majority of PNC’s LIBOR exposures have already transitioned or will transition to a non-LIBOR rate on their
next reset date. As previously anticipated, a small subset of these exposures will leverage the Adjustable Interest Rate LIBOR Act for
its intended purpose to address difficult exposures when necessary or will transition to “synthetic LIBOR,” a substitute version of
LIBOR to be published through the end of September 2024 and calculated under an alternative methodology based on CME Term
SOFR plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment.
RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS
Bank Failures and Resolutions
Following the bank failures in March 2023 of Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, and Signature Bank, New York, New
York, and after recommendations by the boards of the FDIC and Federal Reserve and a determination by the Secretary of the Treasury
in consultation with the President, the FDIC invoked the systemic risk exception to certain resolution-related and Deposit Insurance
Fund restrictions in order to fully protect all depositors of both institutions, including uninsured deposits. The FDIC currently
estimates the cost of protecting the uninsured depositors to the Deposit Insurance Fund at approximately $15.8 billion. By law, any
losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund to support uninsured depositors under the systemic risk exception must be recovered by one or
more special assessments on insured depository institutions or depository institution holding companies, or both. In May 2023, the
FDIC proposed a rule to implement the special assessment. Under the proposal, the FDIC would collect from PNC, along with other
BHCs and insured depository institutions, special assessments at an annual rate of 12.5 basis points of PNC’s uninsured deposits
reported as of December 31, 2022 (adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion), over eight quarterly assessment periods, beginning after the
first quarter 2024. See Note 16 Regulatory Matters for additional information.
Capital, Capital Planning, and Liquidity
In June 2023, the Federal Reserve announced the results of its supervisory stress tests conducted as part of the 2023 CCAR process.
PNC remained well above its risk-based minimum capital requirements in the supervisory stress tests, and PNC’s SCB for the fourquarter period beginning October 1, 2023, will improve to the regulatory minimum of 2.5%. See the Liquidity and Capital
Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Financial Review for a discussion of PNC’s capital actions.
Proposed Expanded Risk-Based Capital Rules
On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC proposed for public comment an interagency rule to implement the final
components of the Basel III framework that would significantly revise the capital requirements for large banking organizations,
including PNC and PNC Bank. In general, the proposed rule would align the regulatory capital elements and required deductions for
Category III banking organizations such as PNC and PNC Bank with those currently applicable to Category I and II banking
organizations and apply a new expanded risk-based approach which leverages the Basel rules, including the calculation of riskweighted assets (the “expanded risk-based approach”) in addition to the current U.S. standardized approach. Our review of the
proposal is ongoing. Among other impacts, PNC and PNC Bank would be required to recognize most elements of AOCI in regulatory
capital and deduct from CET1 capital, among other items, mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets that individually exceed
10 percent of CET1 capital or in the aggregate with other threshold items that exceed 15 percent of CET1 capital. The new expanded
risk-based approach to calculating risk-weighted assets would apply more granular and standardized risk-weighting methodologies for
credit, operational, market, equity and credit valuation adjustment risks. PNC and PNC Bank would be required to calculate their riskbased capital ratios under the existing standardized approach and the expanded risk-based approach and would be subject to the lower
of the two resulting ratios for their risk-based capital minimums and buffer requirements, including the SCB. Based on our initial
review of the proposal, we expect the proposal, if finalized in its current form, would result in lower pro forma capital ratios for PNC
and PNC Bank that would remain above current minimum capital and buffer requirements. The proposal indicates the effective date of
the final rule would be July 1, 2025, with certain provisions—including the recognition of AOCI elements in regulatory capital and the
increase in risk-weighted assets due to the expanded risk-based approach—having a three-year phase-in period. Comments on the
proposal are due by November 30, 2023.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2022
Form 10-K describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or
economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions, and such variations may significantly affect our
reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. The policies and judgments related to residential and
commercial MSRs and Level 3 fair value measurements are described in Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments in our 2022
Form 10-K. The following details the critical estimates and judgments around the ACL.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We maintain the ACL at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on our
existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments, for
the remaining contractual term of the assets or exposures, taking into consideration expected prepayments and estimated recoveries.
Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, as well as current borrower and transaction
characteristics including collateral type and quality, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future
conditions and other relevant factors. We use methods sensitive to changes in economic conditions to interpret these factors and to
estimate expected credit losses. We evaluate and, when appropriate, enhance the quality of our data and models and other methods
used to estimate the ACL on an ongoing basis. We incorporate qualitative factors in the ACL that reflect our best estimate of expected
losses that may not be adequately represented in our quantitative methods or economic assumptions. The major drivers of ACL
estimates include, but are not limited to:
• Current economic conditions: Our forecast of expected losses depends on economic conditions as of the estimation date. As
current economic conditions evolve, forecasted losses could be materially affected.
• Scenario weights and design: Our loss estimates are sensitive to the shape, direction and rate of change of macroeconomic
forecasts and thus vary significantly between upside and downside scenarios. Changes to probability weights assigned to
these scenarios and timing of peak business cycles reflected by the scenarios could materially affect our loss estimates.
• Current borrower quality: Our forecast of expected losses depends on current borrower and transaction characteristics,
including credit metrics and collateral type/quality. As borrower quality evolves, forecasted losses could be materially
affected.
• Portfolio volume and mix: Changes to portfolio volume and mix could materially affect our estimates, as CECL reserves
would be recognized upon origination or acquisition and derecognized upon paydown, maturity or sale.
For all assets and unfunded lending related commitments within the scope of the CECL standard, the applicable ACL is composed of
one or a combination of the following components: (i) collectively assessed or pooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed reserves, and
(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our methodologies and key assumptions for each of these components are discussed in Note 1
Accounting Policies.
Reasonable and Supportable Economic Forecast
Under the CECL standard, we are required to consider reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses. For
this purpose, we have established a framework that includes a three-year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios with
associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes. Credit losses estimated in our
reasonable and supportable forecast period are sensitive to the shape and severity of the scenarios used and weights assigned to them.
To generate the four economic forecast scenarios, we use a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of
economic activity and forward-looking expert judgment to forecast the distribution of economic outcomes over the reasonable and
supportable forecast period. Each scenario is then given an associated probability (weight) to represent our current expectation within
that distribution over the forecast period. This process is informed by current economic conditions, expected business cycle evolution
and the expert judgment of PNC’s RAC. This approach seeks to provide a reasonable representation of the forecast of expected
economic outcomes and is used to estimate expected credit losses across a variety of loans and securities. Each quarter, the scenarios
are presented to RAC for approval, and the committee also approves CECL scenarios’ weights for use for the current reporting period.
The scenarios used for the period ended June 30, 2023 reflect a slight increase in downside risk compared to December 31, 2022. The
current outlook considers, among other factors, the ongoing inflationary pressures and the corresponding tightening of monetary
policy and credit availability. Our most-likely expectation at June 30, 2023 is that the U.S. economy will be impacted by a mild
recession starting in late 2023 or early 2024.
We used a number of economic variables in our scenarios, with two of the most significant drivers being real GDP and the U.S.
unemployment rate. The following table presents a comparison of these two economic variables based on the weighted-average
scenario forecasts used in determining our ACL at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Table 35: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL Weighted-Average Scenarios
Assumptions as of June 30, 2023
2023 2024 2025
U.S. real GDP (a) 0.9% (0.1)% 1.9%
U.S. unemployment rate (b) 4.0% 4.9% 4.5%
Assumptions as of December 31, 2022
2023 2024 2025
U.S. real GDP (a) (0.4)% 1.4% 1.9%
U.S. unemployment rate (b) 4.9% 4.9% 4.4%
(a) Represents year-over-year growth (loss) rates.
(b) Represents quarterly average rate at December 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.
Real GDP growth is expected to end 2023 at 0.9% on a weighted average basis, up from the (0.4%) assumed at December 31, 2022
primarily due to stronger economic activity at the start of 2023. Growth then drops to (0.1)% in 2024, before jumping to 1.9% in 2025.
In line with stronger-than-anticipated job growth at the start of 2023, the weighted-average projection of the unemployment rate is
expected to end 2023 at 4.0%, down from the 4.9% assumed at December 31, 2022. In line with the slowing in overall economic
activity, the weighted-average unemployment rate is expected to increase through the end of 2023 and 2024, reaching 4.9% by yearend 2024, and gradually improving to 4.5% by the fourth quarter of 2025.
The current state of the economy reflects an environment with receding pandemic-related risks and labor-related supply chain
pressures. However, heightened uncertainty remains due to structural and secular changes fostered by the pandemic for certain sectors
of the economy combined with inflation and rising interest rates. As such, for both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, PNC
identified and performed significant analysis around segments impacted by such uncertainties to ensure our reserves are adequate,
given our current macroeconomic expectations.
We believe the economic scenarios effectively reflect the distribution of potential economic outcomes. Additionally, through in-depth
and granular analysis, we have addressed reserve requirements for the specific populations most affected in the current environment.
Through this approach, we believe the reserve levels appropriately reflect the expected credit losses in the portfolio as of the balance
sheet date.

INTERNAL CONTROLS AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
As of June 30, 2023, we performed an evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and of changes in our internal control over financial reporting.
Based on that evaluation, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934) were effective as of June 30, 2023, and that there has been no change in PNC’s internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the second quarter of 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
We make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for financial
performance, such as earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial
position, and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations, including our sustainability strategy, that
are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are
typically identified by words such as “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “see,” “look,” “intend,” “outlook,” “project,”
“forecast,” “estimate,” “goal,” “will,” “should” and other similar words and expressions.
Forward-looking statements are necessarily subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Future
events or circumstances may change our outlook and may also affect the nature of the assumptions, risks and uncertainties to which
our forward-looking statements are subject. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty
and do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly
materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance. As a result, we caution
against placing undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.
Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.
• Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including:
– Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets,
40 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
– Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets,
– Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact
money supply, market interest rates and inflation,
– Changes in customer behavior due to changing business and economic conditions or legislative or regulatory
initiatives,
– Changes in customers’, suppliers’ and other counterparties’ performance and creditworthiness,
– Impacts of sanctions, tariffs and other trade policies of the U.S. and its global trading partners,
– A continuation of turmoil in the banking industry, responsive measures to mitigate and manage it and related
supervisory and regulatory actions and costs,
– Impacts of changes in federal, state and local governmental policy, including on the regulatory landscape, capital
markets, taxes, infrastructure spending and social programs,
– PNC’s ability to attract, recruit and retain skilled employees, and
– Commodity price volatility.
• Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be
substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account the potential impact of legal and
regulatory contingencies. These statements are based on our views that:
– The economy continued to expand in the first half of 2023, but economic growth is slowing in response to the
ongoing Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening to slow inflation. This has led to large increases in both shortand long-term interest rates. The housing market stabilized in the first half of 2023 as the Federal Reserve signaled a
potential end to its federal funds rate hiking cycle. However, given the upward trajectory in mortgage rates and
declining affordability, PNC continues to expect slower activity in the housing market in the second half of 2023
with a recovery in early 2024 as the Federal Reserve starts cutting the federal funds rate.
– PNC’s baseline outlook is for a mild recession starting in late 2023 or early 2024, with a smaller contraction in real
GDP of less than 1%, lasting into mid-2024. The unemployment rate will increase in the second half of this year,
ending 2023 at above 4%, and then peak slightly above 5% in early 2025. Inflation will slow with weaker demand,
moving back to the Federal Reserve’s 2% objective by this time next year.
– PNC expects the federal funds rate to remain between 5.25% and 5.50% through March 2024, when it is expected
that the Federal Reserve will cut rates in response to the recession.
• PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or
exceeding minimum capital levels, including an SCB established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the
Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process.
• PNC’s regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the company’s financial performance, the
scope and terms of final capital regulations then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of PNC’s
balance sheet. In addition, PNC’s ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions
(such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the
development, validation and regulatory review of related models and the reliability of and risks resulting from extensive use
of such models.
• Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results
of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could
affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and ability to attract and retain employees. These
developments could include:
– Changes to laws and regulations, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, changes in
the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations, and changes in accounting and reporting standards.
– Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or
other inquiries resulting in monetary losses, costs, or alterations in our business practices, and potentially causing
reputational harm to PNC.
– Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of
agreements with governmental agencies.
– Costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual
property protection in general.
• Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses,
including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital
management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards.
• Our reputation and business and operating results may be affected by our ability to appropriately meet or address
environmental, social or governance targets, goals, commitments or concerns that may arise.
• We grow our business in part through acquisitions and new strategic initiatives. Risks and uncertainties include those
presented by the nature of the business acquired and strategic initiative, including in some cases those associated with our
entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as
well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, the integration of the
acquired businesses into PNC after closing or any failure to execute strategic or operational plans.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 41 
• Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing,
which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also
impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.
• Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread manmade, natural and other disasters (including severe
weather events), health emergencies, dislocations, geopolitical instabilities or events, terrorist activities, system failures or
disruptions, security breaches, cyberattacks, international hostilities, or other extraordinary events beyond PNC’s control
through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties, customers or third-party
vendors and service providers specifically.
We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in our 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs and elsewhere
in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in these reports. Our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and
uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC.
