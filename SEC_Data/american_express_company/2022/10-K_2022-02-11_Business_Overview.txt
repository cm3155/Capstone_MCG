 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

American Express is a globally integrated payments company that provides our customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. We are a leader in providing credit and charge cards to consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations around the world. American Express &#174; cards issued by us, as well as by third-party banks and other institutions on the American Express network, can be used by Card Members to charge purchases at the millions of merchants around the world that accept cards bearing our logo. 

Our various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups through various channels, including mobile and online applications, affiliate marketing, customer referral programs, third-party service providers and business partners, direct mail, telephone, in-house sales teams and direct response advertising. 

We were founded in 1850 as a joint stock association and were incorporated in 1965 as a New York corporation. American Express Company and its principal operating subsidiary, American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (TRS), are bank holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act), subject to supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve). 

We principally engage in businesses comprising three reportable operating segments: Global Consumer Services Group (GCSG), Global Commercial Services (GCS) and Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS). Corporate functions and certain other businesses are included in Corporate &#38; Other. Our businesses are global in scope and function together to form our end-to-end integrated payments platform, which we believe is a differentiator that underpins our business model. While our business was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we believe our growth momentum through 2021 strengthens our focus on our strategic imperatives and the resilience of our differentiated business model. 

For further information about our reportable operating segments, please see &#8220;Business Segment Results of Operations&#8221; under &#8220;MD&#38;A.&#8221;

Our Integrated Payments Platform 

Through our general-purpose card-issuing, merchant-acquiring and card network businesses, we are able to connect participants and provide differentiated value across the commerce path. We maintain direct relationships with both our Card Members (as a card issuer) and merchants (as an acquirer), and we handle all key aspects of those relationships. These relationships create a &#8220;closed loop&#8221; in that we have direct access to information at both ends of the card transaction, which distinguishes our integrated payments platform from the bankcard networks. 

Our integrated payments platform allows us to analyze information on Card Member spending and build algorithms and other analytical tools that we use to underwrite risk, reduce fraud and provide targeted marketing and other information services for merchants and special offers and services to Card Members, all while respecting Card Member preferences and protecting Card Member and merchant data in compliance with applicable policies and legal requirements. Through contractual relationships, we also obtain information from third-party card issuers, merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors with whom we do business. 

Card Issuing Businesses 

Our global proprietary card-issuing businesses are conducted through our GCSG and GCS reportable operating segments. We offer a broad set of card products, rewards and services to a diverse consumer and commercial customer base, in the United States and internationally. We acquire and retain high-spending, engaged and creditworthy Card Members by: 

&#8226; Designing innovative products and features that appeal to our target customer base and meet their spending and borrowing needs 

&#8226; Using incentives to drive spending on our various card products and engender loyal Card Members, including our Membership Rewards &#174; program, cash-back reward features and participation in loyalty programs sponsored by our cobrand and other partners 

&#8226; Providing digital and mobile services and an array of benefits and experiences across card products, such as airport lounge access, dining experiences and other travel and lifestyle benefits, which we believe are difficult for others to replicate and help increase Card Member engagement 

&#8226; Creating world-class service experiences by delivering exceptional customer care 

&#8226; Developing a wide range of partner relationships, including with other corporations and institutions that sponsor certain of our cards under cobrand arrangements and provide benefits and services to our Card Members 

Over the last several years, we have focused on broadening the appeal of our products to attract new customers, particularly Millennial and Gen Z customers, as well as expanding our position with small and mid-sized enterprise (SME) customers by providing more ways to help them manage and grow their businesses. During 2020, we enhanced our value propositions on many of our products, including adjusting our rewards programs and adding limited time offers and statement credits in categories that were relevant to how customer spending behaviors were changing, such as wireless telephone services, streaming services, business essentials and food delivery. We also enhanced and expanded our financial relief programs to assist our customers who faced financial hardships. As the pandemic continued, we made the decision to increase investments to drive customer acquisition, engagement and retention. These initiatives have driven retention and satisfaction metrics higher than pre-pandemic levels. During 2021, we relaunched our consumer Platinum Card and Business Platinum Card in the United States and introduced our first business checking account product and new digital capabilities, in part resulting from the Kabbage technology platform we acquired in 2020. 

For the year ended December 31, 2021, worldwide billed business (spending on American Express cards issued by us) was $1.1 trillion and at December 31, 2021, we had 71.4 million proprietary cards-in-force worldwide. 

Merchant Acquiring Business 

Our GMNS reportable operating segment builds and manages relationships with millions of merchants around the world that choose to accept American Express cards. This includes signing new merchants to accept our cards, agreeing on the discount rate (a fee charged to the merchant for accepting our cards) and handling servicing for merchants. We also build and maintain relationships with merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage aspects of our merchant services business. For example, through our OptBlue &#174; merchant-acquiring program, third-party acquirers contract directly with small merchants for card acceptance on our network and determine merchant pricing. We continue to grow merchant acceptance of American Express cards around the world and work with merchant partners so that our Card Members are warmly welcomed and encouraged to spend in the millions of places where their American Express cards are accepted. 

Table of Contents 

GMNS also provides fraud-prevention tools, marketing solutions, data analytics and other programs and services to merchants and other partners that leverage the capabilities of our integrated payments platform. 

During the pandemic, we increased our investments in our Shop Small campaigns to support small businesses around the world, created a Stand for Small coalition and supported minority-owned small businesses in the United States. We launched debit capabilities on the American Express network and in 2021 introduced our first-ever proprietary debit card in connection with the business checking account product mentioned above. 

Card Network Business 

We operate a payments network through which we establish and maintain relationships with third-party banks and other institutions in approximately 103 countries and territories, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of our global network. These network partners are licensed to issue local currency American Express-branded cards in their countries and/or serve as the merchant acquirer for local merchants on our network. 

During 2021, we continued to grow our business in China through our joint venture with Lianlian DigiTech Co., Ltd, a Chinese fintech services company. 

For the year ended December 31, 2021, worldwide network services processed volume (spending on American Express cards issued by third parties) was $194.4 billion and at December 31, 2021, we had 50.3 million cards-in-force issued by third parties worldwide. 

Diverse Customer Base and Global Footprint 

Our broad and diverse customer base spans consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations around the world. The following charts provide a summary of our diverse set of customers and broad geographic footprint based on worldwide network volumes:

Partners and Relationships 

Our integrated payments platform allows us to work with a range of business partners, and our partners in return help drive the scale and relevance of the platform. 

There are many examples of how we connect partners with our integrated payments platform, including: issuing cards under cobrand arrangements with other corporations and institutions (e.g., Delta Air Lines, Marriott International, Hilton Worldwide Holdings and British Airways); offering innovative ways for our Card Members to earn and use points with our merchants (e.g., Pay with Points at Amazon.com); expanding merchant acceptance with third-party acquirers (e.g., OptBlue partners); developing new capabilities and features with our digital partners (e.g., PayPal); integrating into the supplier payment processes of our business customers (e.g., Bill.com, SAP Ariba and Coupa); and extending the platform into travel services with American Express leisure and business travel (e.g., Fine Hotels and Resorts). 

Delta Air Lines is our largest strategic partner. Our relationships with, and revenues and expenses related to, Delta are significant and represent an important source of value for our Card Members. We issue cards under cobrand arrangements with Delta and the Delta cobrand portfolio represented approximately 9 percent of worldwide network volumes and approximately 21 percent of worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2021. The Delta cobrand portfolio generates fee revenue and interest income from Card Members and discount revenue from Delta and other merchants for spending on Delta cobrand cards. The current Delta cobrand agreement runs through the end of 2029 and we expect to continue to make significant investments in this partnership. Among other things, Delta is also a key participant in our Membership Rewards program, provides travel-related benefits and services, including airport lounge access for certain American Express Card Members, accepts American Express cards as a merchant and is a corporate payments customer. 

Working with all of our partners, we seek to provide value, choice and unique experiences across our customer base. 

Our Spend-Centric Model and Revenue Mix 

Our &#8220;spend-centric&#8221; business model focuses on generating revenues primarily by driving spending on our cards and secondarily through finance charges and fees. Spending on our cards, which is higher on average on a per-card basis versus our competitors, offers superior value to merchants in the form of loyal customers and larger transactions. Because of the revenues generated from having high-spending Card Members and the annual card fees we charge on many of our products, we are able to invest in attractive rewards and other benefits for Card Members, as well as targeted marketing and other programs and investments for merchants. This creates incentives for Card Members to spend more on their cards and positively differentiates American Express cards. 

We believe our spend-centric model gives us the ability to provide differentiated value to Card Members, merchants and business partners. 

The American Express Brand and Service Excellence 

Our brand and its attributes&#8212;trust, security and service&#8212;are key assets. We invest heavily in managing, marketing, promoting and protecting our brand, including through the delivery of our products and services in a manner consistent with our brand promise. The American Express brand is ranked among the most valuable brands in the world. We place significant importance on trademarks, service marks and patents, and seek to secure our intellectual property rights around the world. 

We aim to provide the world&#8217;s best customer experience every day and our reputation for world-class service has been recognized by numerous awards over the years. Our customer care professionals, travel consultants and partners treat servicing interactions as an opportunity to bring the brand to life for our customers, add meaningful value and deepen relationships.

Our Business Strategies 

During 2021, we focused on investing to rebuild growth momentum by firing up our core business, scaling next-horizon opportunities and continuing to retain financial flexibility. Over the longer term, we seek to grow our business by focusing on four strategic imperatives: 

First, we aim to expand our leadership in the premium consumer space by continuing to deliver membership benefits that span our customers&#8217; everyday spending, borrowing, travel and lifestyle needs, expanding our roster of business partners around the globe and developing a range of experiences that attract high-spending customers. 

Second, we seek to build on our strong position in commercial payments by evolving our card value propositions, further differentiating our corporate card and accounts payable expense management solutions and designing innovative products and features, including financing, banking and payment solutions for our business customers. 

Third, we are focused on strengthening our global network to provide unique value by continuing to help merchants navigate the convergence of online and offline commerce with fraud protection services, marketing insights and digital connections to higher-spending Card Members and continuing to work with our network partners to offer expanded products and services. 

Finally, we want to continue to make American Express an essential part of our customers&#8217; digital lives by developing more digital features, solutions and services, expanding our digital partnerships and making targeted acquisitions. 

We also have an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy that focuses on three pillars. The Promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&#38;I) pillar supports a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce, marketplace and society. The Building Financial Confidence pillar seeks to provide responsible, secure and transparent products and services to help people and businesses build financial resilience. Finally, the Advancing Climate Solutions pillar focuses on enhancing our operations and capabilities to meet customer and community needs in the transition to a low-carbon future.

Our Colleagues 

We are committed to delivering a great colleague experience every day. We work to foster an inclusive and diverse culture and help our colleagues grow in their careers and thrive both professionally and personally. As a result, we believe our colleagues are more engaged, committed, creative and effective in driving results. At the heart of our culture is what we call our Blue Box Values &#8211; a set of guiding principles that reflect who we are and what we stand for: 

##TABLE_START We Back Our Customers We Embrace Diversity We Make It Great We Stand for Inclusion We Do What's Right We Win as A Team We Respect People We Support Our Communities ##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 64,000 people, whom we refer to as colleagues, with approximately 22,000 colleagues in the United States and approximately 42,000 colleagues outside the United States. To attract and retain the best talent, we continuously invest in programs, benefits and resources to foster the personal and professional growth of our colleagues. We provide learning opportunities in many forms, including tools and guidance for maximizing learning on the job; cross-border and cross-business unit assignments; career coaching, mentoring, and professional networking; rotation opportunities; virtual learning sessions; and formal classroom instruction. We take a holistic approach to well-being, providing resources that address the physical, financial and emotional health of our colleagues. Throughout the pandemic, one of our top priorities has been to ensure our colleagues have the flexibility and resources they need to stay safe, healthy and productive. 

We conduct an annual Colleague Experience Survey to better understand our colleagues&#8217; needs and overall experience at American Express and in 2021, 90 percent of colleagues who participated in the survey said they would recommend American Express as a great place to work. Our 2021 annual company scorecard included talent retention and diversity representation goals to increase minority and women representation and retain our key talent. While we experienced an increase in colleague attrition in 2021, our high potential and multi-year high performer retention rates met or exceeded our goals. As of December 31, 2021, women represented 52.9 percent of our global workforce and Asian, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx people represented 19.5 percent, 13.3 percent and 13.8 percent, respectively, of our U.S. workforce based on preliminary data for our 2021 U.S. EEO-1 submission. 

We regularly review our compensation practices to ensure colleagues in the same job, level and location are compensated fairly regardless of gender globally, and race and ethnicity in the United States. These reviews consider several factors known to affect compensation, including role, level, tenure, performance and geography. In the instances where a review has found inconsistencies, we have made adjustments. After making these adjustments, we believe we maintained 100 percent pay equity in 2021 for colleagues across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in the United States.

COMPETITION 

We compete in the global payments industry with card networks, issuers and acquirers, paper-based transactions (e.g., cash and checks), bank transfer models (e.g., wire transfers and Automated Clearing House, or ACH), as well as evolving and growing alternative mechanisms, systems and products that leverage new technologies, business models and customer relationships to create payment or financing solutions. The payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies, consumer habits and merchant needs, some of which have accelerated as a result of the pandemic, such as an increased shift to e-commerce and demand for contactless payments. 

As a card issuer, we compete with financial institutions that issue general-purpose credit and debit cards. We also encounter competition from businesses that issue private label cards, operate mobile wallets or extend credit. We face intense competition in the premium space and for cobrand relationships, as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted high-spending customers and key business partners with attractive value propositions. We also face competition for partners and other differentiated offerings, such as lounge space in U.S. and global hub airports. 

Our global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks, including, among others, China UnionPay, Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Discover and Diners Club International (which is owned by Discover). We are the fourth largest general-purpose card network globally based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa and Mastercard. In addition to such networks, a range of companies globally, including merchant acquirers, processors and web- and mobile-based payment platforms (e.g., Alipay, PayPal and Venmo), as well as regional payment networks (such as the National Payments Corporation of India), carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMNS business. 

The principal competitive factors that affect the card-issuing, merchant and network businesses include: 

&#8226; The features, value and quality of the products and services, including customer care, rewards programs, partnerships, travel and lifestyle-related benefits, and digital and mobile services, as well as the costs associated with providing such features and services 

&#8226; Reputation and brand recognition 

&#8226; The number, spending characteristics and credit performance of customers 

&#8226; The quantity, diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used 

&#8226; The attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers, merchant acquirers, cardholders, corporate clients and merchants (including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services, and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics) 

&#8226; The number and quality of other cards and other forms of payment and financing available to customers 

&#8226; The success of marketing and promotional campaigns 

&#8226; The speed of innovation and investment in systems, technologies, and product and service offerings 

&#8226; The nature and quality of expense management tools, electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities, particularly for business customers 

&#8226; The security of cardholder, merchant and network partner information 

Another aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products, which include payment aggregators, digital payment and electronic wallet platforms, point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products, real-time settlement and processing systems, financial technology companies, digital currencies developed by both central banks and the private sector, blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies, prepaid systems and gift cards, and systems linked to customer accounts or that provide payment solutions. Various competitors are integrating more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are seeking to attain the benefits of closed-loop, loyalty and rewards functionalities, such as ours.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

Overview 

We are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, and the costs of compliance are substantial. The financial services industry is subject to rigorous scrutiny, high regulatory expectations, a range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment. 

Governmental authorities have focused, and we believe will continue to focus, considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms with laws and regulations, and as a result, we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework, governance structures, practices and procedures. Reviews by us and governmental authorities to assess compliance with laws and regulations, as well as our own internal reviews to assess compliance with internal policies, including errors or misconduct by colleagues or third parties or control failures, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, changes to our products, practices and procedures, restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination. We have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions, including governmental inquiries, investigations, enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties, in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations. External publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of those investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries. 

In addition, legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the offering of consumer financial products and the operation of payment networks, resulting in changes to certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks, and, in some cases, the establishment of broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes. 

See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks&#8221; for a discussion of the potential impact legislative and regulatory changes may have on our results of operations and financial condition. 

Banking Regulation 

Federal and state banking laws, regulations and policies extensively regulate the Company (which, for purposes of this section, refers to American Express Company as a bank holding company), TRS and our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB). Both the Company and TRS are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve and AENB is supervised, regulated and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to the rulemaking, enforcement and examination authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Banking regulators have broad examination and enforcement power, including the power to impose substantial fines, limit dividends and other capital distributions, restrict operations and acquisitions and require divestitures, any of which could compromise our competitive position. Many aspects of our business also are subject to rigorous regulation by other U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and by non-U.S. government agencies and regulatory bodies. 

Activities 

The BHC Act generally limits bank holding companies to activities that are considered to be banking activities and certain closely related activities. As noted above, each of the Company and TRS is a bank holding company and each has elected to become a financial holding company, which is authorized to engage in a broader range of financial and related activities. In order to remain eligible for financial holding company status, we must meet certain eligibility requirements. Those requirements include that each of the Company and AENB must be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed,&#8221; and AENB must have received at least a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating on its most recent assessment under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the CRA). The Company and TRS engage in various activities permissible only for financial holding companies, including, in particular, providing travel agency services, acting as a finder and engaging in certain insurance underwriting and agency services. If the Company fails to meet eligibility requirements for financial holding company status, it and its subsidiaries are likely to be barred from engaging in new types of financial activities or making certain types of acquisitions or investments in reliance on its status as a financial holding company, and ultimately could be required to either discontinue the broader range of activities permitted to financial holding companies or divest AENB. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are prohibited by law from engaging in practices that the relevant regulatory authority deems unsafe or unsound (which such authorities generally interpret broadly). 

Table of Contents 

Acquisitions and Investments 

Applicable federal and state laws place limitations on the ability of persons to invest in or acquire control of us without providing notice to or obtaining the approval of one or more of our regulators. In addition, we are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit our investments and acquisitions and, in some cases, subject them to the prior review and approval of our regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the OCC. Federal banking regulators have broad discretion in evaluating proposed acquisitions and investments that are subject to their prior review or approval. 

Financial Regulatory Reform 

The Company is subject to the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies' rules that tailor the application of enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. Under these rules, each bank holding company, as well as its bank subsidiaries, is assigned to one of four categories based on its status as a U.S. global systemically important banking organization and five other risk-based indicators: (i) total assets, (ii) cross-jurisdictional activity, (iii) non-bank assets, (iv) off-balance sheet exposure, and (v) weighted short-term wholesale funding. 

Under these rules, the Company (and its depository institution subsidiary, AENB) is subject to Category IV standards. 

Because a firm&#8217;s categorization is determined by, and can change over time dependent upon, how the firm measures against the risk-based indicator thresholds, we are required to monitor and periodically report these risk-based indicators and there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be a Category IV firm in the future. 

Capital and Liquidity Regulation 

Capital Rules 

The Company and AENB are required to comply with the applicable capital adequacy rules established by federal banking regulators. These rules are intended to ensure that bank holding companies and depository institutions (collectively, banking organizations) have adequate capital given their level of assets and off-balance sheet obligations. The federal banking regulators&#8217; current capital rules (the Capital Rules) implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision&#8217;s (the Basel Committee) framework for strengthening international capital regulation, known as Basel III. For additional information regarding our capital ratios, see &#8220;Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity&#8221; under &#8220;MD&#38;A.&#8221; 

Under the Capital Rules, banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1 capital), Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets. We report our capital adequacy ratios using risk-weighted assets calculated under the standardized approach. As a Category IV firm, we are not subject to the advanced approaches capital requirements. 

In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that, among other things, revise the standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing additional capital requirements for certain &#8220;unconditionally cancellable commitments&#8221; such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized calculation for operational risk capital requirements. If adopted in the United States as issued by the Basel Committee and applicable to us, the new standards are likely to result in higher capital requirements for us. 

In December 2018, federal banking regulators issued a final rule that provides an optional three-year phase-in period for the adverse regulatory capital effects of adopting the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) methodology pursuant to new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on certain financial instruments, which became effective January 1, 2020. In August 2020, federal banking regulators issued a final rule that provides an option to delay the estimated impact of the adoption of the CECL methodology on regulatory capital for up to two years, followed by the three-year phase-in period. We elected to adopt the two-year delay followed by the three-year phase-in period. Therefore, the Company began phasing in the cumulative amount that is not recognized in regulatory capital at 25 percent per year beginning January 1, 2022.

The Company and AENB must each maintain CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of at least 4.5 percent, 6.0 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively. On top of these minimum capital ratios, the Company is subject to a dynamic stress capital buffer (SCB) composed entirely of CET1 capital with a floor of 2.5 percent and AENB is subject to a static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer (CCB). The SCB equals (i) the difference between a bank holding company&#8217;s starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario under the Federal Reserve's stress tests described below, plus (ii) one year of planned common stock dividends as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. 

On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve confirmed the SCB for the Company of 2.5 percent, which remained unchanged from the level announced in August 2020. As a result, the effective minimum ratios for the Company (taking into account the SCB requirement) and AENB (taking into account the CCB requirement) are 7.0 percent, 8.5 percent and 10.5 percent for the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, respectively. Banking organizations whose ratios of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital or Total capital to risk-weighted assets are below these effective minimum ratios face constraints on discretionary distributions such as dividends, repurchases and redemptions of capital securities, and executive compensation. A bank holding company&#8217;s SCB requirement is generally effective on October 1 of each year and will remain in effect through September 30 of the following year unless it is reset in connection with resubmission of a capital plan, as discussed below. 

We are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements. The leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization&#8217;s Tier 1 capital to its average total consolidated assets (as defined for regulatory purposes). All banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent. 

Liquidity Regulation 

The Federal Reserve&#8217;s enhanced prudential standards rule includes heightened liquidity and overall risk management requirements. The rule requires the maintenance of a liquidity buffer, consisting of highly liquid assets, that is sufficient to meet projected net outflows for 30 days over a range of liquidity stress scenarios, and a minimum liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) that measures a firm&#8217;s high-quality liquid assets to its projected net outflows. Category IV firms with less than $50 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding, such as the Company, are not subject to a specific LCR requirement. 

A second standard provided for in the Basel III liquidity framework, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), requires a minimum amount of longer-term funding based on the assets and activities of banking entities. Under the NSFR rule, Category IV firms with less than $50 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding, such as the Company, are not subject to a specific NSFR requirement. 

Stress Testing and Capital Planning 

Under the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulations, the Company is subject to supervisory stress testing requirements that are designed to evaluate whether a bank holding company has sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis to absorb losses and support operations under adverse economic conditions. As part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), the Federal Reserve uses pro-forma capital positions and ratios under such stress scenarios to determine the size of the SCB for each CCAR participating firm. 

As a Category IV firm, the Company is required to participate in the supervisory stress tests every other year and is subject to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s supervisory stress tests in 2022. The Company is required to develop and submit to the Federal Reserve an annual capital plan on or before April 5 of each year. 

For Category IV firms, such as the Company, the portion of the SCB based on the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress tests is calculated every other year. During a year in which a Category IV firm does not undergo a supervisory stress test, the firm receives an updated SCB that reflects the firm's updated planned common stock dividends. A Category IV firm can elect to participate in the supervisory stress test in an &#8220; off year&#8221; and consequently receive an updated SCB. 

Table of Contents 

Due to the economic uncertainty related to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve prohibited share repurchases in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 for all bank holding companies participating in CCAR, but a llowed them to pay common stock dividends provided (a) they did not increase the amount of the dividend and (b) the dividends did not exceed the average of a firm&#8217;s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. During the first and second quarters of 2021, the Federal Reserve allowed bank holding companies participating in CCAR to repurchase common stock and pay common stock dividends provided (a) the repurchases and dividends, in the aggregate, did not exceed the average of a firm&#8217;s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters and (b) the firm did not increase the amount of its common stock dividends beyond the level paid in the second quarter of 2020. The Federal Reserve also permitted stock repurchases equal to the amount of share issuances related to expensed employee compensation. These capital distribution restrictions ceased to apply on July 1, 2021. For additional information regarding our capital distributions, see &#8220;Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity&#8221; under &#8220;MD&#38;A.&#8221; 

We may be required to revise and resubmit our capital plan following certain events or developments, such as a significant acquisition or an event that could result in a material change in our risk profile or financial condition. If we are required to resubmit our capital plan, we must receive prior approval from the Federal Reserve for any capital distributions (including common stock dividend payments and share repurchases), other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument. 

Dividends and Other Capital Distributions 

The Company and TRS, as well as AENB and the Company&#8217;s insurance and other regulated subsidiaries, are limited in their ability to pay dividends by statutes, regulations and supervisory policy. 

Common stock dividend payments and share repurchases by the Company are subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve, as described above. The Company will be subject to limitations and restrictions on capital distributions if, among other things, (i) the Company's regulatory capital ratios do not satisfy applicable minimum requirements and buffers or (ii) the Company is required to resubmit its capital plan. 

In general, federal laws and regulations prohibit, without first obtaining the OCC&#8217;s approval, AENB from making dividend distributions to TRS, if such distributions are not paid out of available recent earnings or would cause AENB to fail to meet capital adequacy standards. In addition to specific limitations on the dividends AENB can pay to TRS, federal banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of a dividend if, in the banking regulator&#8217;s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the institution. 

Prompt Corrective Action 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) requires, among other things, that federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions insured by the FDIC (such as AENB) that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The FDIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified. In order to be considered &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; AENB must maintain CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios of 6.5 percent, 8.0 percent, 10.0 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively. 

Under the FDIA, AENB could be prohibited from accepting brokered deposits (i.e., deposits raised through third-party brokerage networks) or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless (1) it is well capitalized or (2) it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A portion of our outstanding U.S. retail deposits are considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes. If a federal regulator determines that we are in an unsafe or unsound condition or that we are engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices, the regulator may reclassify our capital category or otherwise place restrictions on our ability to accept or solicit brokered deposits. 

In December 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule intended to update and modernize the FDIC&#8217;s brokered deposit regulations. Effective April 1, 2021, the final rule, among other things, expanded the definition of &#8220;deposit broker&#8221; and updated the interest rate restrictions for less than well capitalized banks.

Resolution Planning 

Certain bank holding companies are required to submit resolution plans to the Federal Reserve and FDIC providing for the company&#8217;s strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of its material financial distress or failure. However, Category IV firms, such as the Company, are not required to submit a holding company resolution plan. 

AENB continues to be required to prepare and provide a separate resolution plan to the FDIC that would enable the FDIC, as receiver, to effectively resolve AENB under the FDIA in the event of failure. The FDIC issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on potential revisions to this separate resolution plan requirement for insured depository institutions in April 2019 and temporarily suspended resolution planning requirements for insured depository institutions. In January 2021, the FDIC lifted the moratorium on resolution plan submissions for insured depository institutions with $100 billion or more in assets, including AENB. 

On June 25, 2021, the FDIC released a statement outlining a modified approach to implementing the FDIC&#8217;s rule requiring insured depository institutions with $100 billion or more in total assets to submit resolution plans. Among other things, the modified approach (i) extends the resolution plan&#8217;s submission frequency to a three-year cycle; (ii) lays out new details regarding the FDIC&#8217;s emphasis on engagement with firms; and (iii) exempts filers from other content requirements that the FDIC has determined have been less useful or are obtainable through other supervisory channels. 

Orderly Liquidation Authority 

The Company could become subject to the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA), a resolution regime under which the Treasury Secretary may appoint the FDIC as receiver to liquidate a systemically important financial institution, if the Company is in danger of default and is determined to present a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability. As under the FDIC resolution model, under the OLA, the FDIC has broad power as receiver. Substantial differences exist, however, between the OLA and the FDIC resolution model for depository institutions, including the right of the FDIC under the OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in limited circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditor claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure used in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a &#8220;bridge&#8221; entity. 

The FDIC has developed a strategy under OLA, referred to as the &#8220;single point of entry&#8221; or &#8220;SPOE&#8221; strategy, under which the FDIC would resolve a failed financial holding company by transferring its assets (including shares of its operating subsidiaries) and, potentially, very limited liabilities to a &#8220;bridge&#8221; holding company; utilize the resources of the failed financial holding company to recapitalize the operating subsidiaries; and satisfy the claims of unsecured creditors of the failed financial holding company and other claimants in the receivership by delivering securities of one or more new financial companies that would emerge from the bridge holding company. Under this strategy, management of the failed financial holding company would be replaced and its shareholders and creditors would bear the losses resulting from the failure. 

FDIC Powers upon Insolvency of AENB 

If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of AENB, the FDIC has the power: (1) to transfer any of AENB&#8217;s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of AENB&#8217;s creditors; (2) to enforce the terms of AENB&#8217;s contracts pursuant to their terms; or (3) to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which AENB is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of AENB. In addition, the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC against AENB would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against AENB, including claims of debt holders and depositors in non-U.S. offices, in the liquidation or other resolution of AENB. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of AENB, the debt holders and depositors in non-U.S. offices would be treated differently from, and could receive substantially less, if anything, than the depositors in the U.S. offices of AENB.

Other Banking Regulations 

Source of Strength 

The Company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, and may be required to commit capital and financial resources to support AENB. Such support may be required at times when, absent this requirement, the Company otherwise might determine not to provide it. Capital loans by the Company to AENB are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of AENB. In the event of the Company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Company to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of AENB will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. 

Transactions Between AENB and its Affiliates 

Certain transactions (including loans and credit extensions from AENB) between AENB and its affiliates (including the Company, TRS and their other subsidiaries) are subject to quantitative and qualitative limitations, collateral requirements and other restrictions imposed by statute and regulation. Transactions subject to these restrictions are generally required to be made on an arm&#8217;s-length basis. 

FDIC Deposit Insurance and Insurance Assessments 

AENB accepts deposits that are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institution&#8217;s deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices; is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations; or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that would lead to termination of deposit insurance at AENB. The FDIC&#8217;s deposit insurance fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions, including AENB, which are subject to adjustment by the FDIC. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

AENB is subject to the CRA, which imposes affirmative, ongoing obligations on depository institutions to meet the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution. In May 2020, the OCC issued a final rule intended to (i) clarify which activities qualify for CRA credit; (ii) update where activities count for CRA credit; and (iii) change the methods for CRA measurement, data collection, recordkeeping and reporting for national banks and federal savings associations. Effective January 1, 2022, that final rule was rescinded and replaced with a rule based on the rules adopted jointly by the federal banking agencies in 1995, as amended. This action was intended to promote consistency for all insured depository institutions while the agencies continue their ongoing work to modernize the CRA framework on an interagency basis. 

Climate Risk Management 

The U.S. banking agencies steadily increased their focus on climate risk-related supervision during 2021 and are expected to expand and formalize that focus in 2022. For example, on October 21, 2021, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) issued its Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk, which contains 35 recommendations for FSOC&#8217;s member agencies and serves as a framework for next steps. In addition, on December 16, 2021, the OCC issued for public comment a set of proposed &#8220;Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks.&#8221; The principles would apply to OCC-regulated institutions with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets, like AENB, and are broadly designed to provide a high-level framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks consistent with existing OCC rules and guidance. The principles outline six key aspects of climate-related financial risk management: governance; policies, procedures and limits; strategic planning; risk management; data, risk measurement and reporting; and scenario analysis. In addition, the principles offer risk assessment guidance for incorporating climate-related financial risks in various traditional risk categories. It is too early to determine what regulations and policies may be adopted or apply to the Company and AENB and the effect of any such regulations or policies on the Company and AENB.

Consumer Financial Products Regulation 

In the United States, our marketing, sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the CFPB, which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit, savings and payment services and products, and authority to prevent &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#8221; acts or practices. The CFPB has the authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, to enforce those laws and to examine for compliance. It is also authorized to collect fines and require consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. In addition, a number of U.S. states have significant consumer credit protection, disclosure and other laws (in certain cases more stringent than U.S. federal laws). U.S. federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices, which, along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws, can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny. 

On November 30, 2021, the CFPB&#8217;s final rule that sets forth additional requirements for third-party debt collection agencies, which we use in the ordinary course of business, became effective. See &#8220; We are exposed to credit risk and trends that affect Card Member spending and the ability of customers and partners to pay us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition &#8221; under &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for potential impacts related to legal and regulatory changes on our ability to collect amounts owed to us. 

We are also regulated in the United States under the &#8220;money transmitter&#8221; or &#8220;sale of check&#8221; laws in effect in most states. In addition, we are required by the laws of many states to comply with unclaimed and abandoned property laws, under which we must pay to states the face amount of any Travelers Cheque or prepaid card that is uncashed or unredeemed after a period of time depending on the type of product. Additionally, we are regulated under insurance laws in the United States and other countries where we offer insurance services. 

In countries outside the United States, regulators continue to focus on a number of key areas impacting our card-issuing businesses, particularly consumer protection (such as in the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom and Canada) and responsible lending (such as in Australia, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore), with increasing importance on and attention to customers and outcomes rather than just ensuring compliance with local rules and regulations. Regulators&#8217; expectations of firms in relation to their compliance, risk and control frameworks continue to increase and regulators are placing significant emphasis on a firm&#8217;s systems and controls relating to the identification and resolution of issues. 

Payments Regulation 

Legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks, including through enforcement actions, legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks, and, in some cases, to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems. 

The EU, Australia, Canada and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees (that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like Visa and Mastercard), as well as the rules, contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance. Regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly, as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants. Among other things, regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, and we have exited our network businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions, for example. There is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the EU and UK payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU and the UK. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU or the UK. 

In various countries, such as certain Member States in the EU and Australia, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. In addition, the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been overturned and certain states have passed or are considering laws to permit surcharging by merchants. Surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business. In addition, other steering or differential acceptance practices that are permitted by regulation in some jurisdictions could also have a material adverse effect on us. See &#8220; Surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations &#8221; under &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Table of Contents 

In some countries, governments have established regulatory regimes that require international card networks to be locally licensed and/or to localize aspects of their operations. For example, the Reserve Bank of India, which has broad power under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 to regulate the membership and operations of card networks, has issued a mandate requiring payment systems operators in India to store certain payments data locally. On April 23, 2021, the Reserve Bank of India imposed restrictions on the ability of American Express Banking Corp. to engage in certain card issuing activities in India from May 1, 2021 until it complies with a regulation requiring storage of payment transaction data exclusively in India. This order does not impact existing customers. We are working towards complying with the regulation. Governments in some countries also provide resources or protection to select domestic payment card networks. The development and enforcement of these and other similar laws, regulations and policies may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network. 

Privacy, Data Protection, Data Governance, Information and Cyber Security 

Regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy, data protection, data governance and information and cyber security continues to increase worldwide. We have established and continue to maintain policies and a governance framework to comply with applicable privacy, data protection, data governance and information and cyber security laws and requirements, meet evolving customer and industry expectations and support and enable business innovation and growth. 

Our regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that our privacy, data protection, data governance and information and cyber security-related policies and practices are adequate to inform customers of our data collection, use, sharing and/or security practices, to provide them with choices, if required, about how we use and share their information, and to appropriately safeguard their personal information and account access. Regulators are also focused on data management, data governance and our third-party risk management policies and practices. 

In the United States, certain of our businesses are subject to the privacy, disclosure and safeguarding provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and its implementing regulations and guidance. Among other things, GLBA imposes certain limitations on our ability to share consumers&#8217; nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties and requires us to develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the size and complexity of our business, the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of customer information that we process. More recently, we have expanded privacy rights to California residents who are not covered by GLBA, pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act. Various regulators, U.S. states and territories are considering similar requirements or have adopted laws, rules and regulations pertaining to privacy and/or information and cyber security that may be more stringent and/or expansive than federal requirements. 

We are also subject to certain privacy, data protection, data governance and information and cyber security laws in other countries in which we operate (including countries in the EU, Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, Singapore and the United Kingdom), some of which are more stringent and/or expansive than those in the United States and some of which may conflict with each other. Some countries and the EU have instituted or are considering instituting requirements that make it onerous to transfer personal data to other jurisdictions. Other countries may require in-country data processing and/or in-country storage of data. Compliance with such laws results in higher technology, administrative and other costs for us, could limit our ability to optimize the use of our closed-loop data, and could require use of local technology services. Some of these laws also require us to provide foreign governments and other third parties broader access to our data and intellectual property. Data breach and operational outage notification laws or regulatory activities to encourage such notifications and regulatory activity and laws around resiliency, business continuity and third-party risk management are also becoming more prevalent in jurisdictions outside the United States in which we operate. 

In Europe, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes legal and compliance obligations on companies that process personal data of individuals in the EU, irrespective of the geographical location of the company, with the potential for significant fines for non-compliance (up to 4 percent of total annual worldwide revenue). The GDPR includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches, in certain circumstances, to affected individuals and supervisory authorities. The UK GDPR, which became effective in January 2021, mirrors the compliance requirements and fine structure of the GDPR.

Anti-Money Laundering, Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Compliance 

We are subject to significant supervision and regulation, and an increasingly stringent enforcement environment, with respect to compliance with anti-money laundering (AML), sanctions and anti-corruption laws and regulations in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which we operate. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs and policies and procedures for AML, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance could have material financial, legal and reputational consequences. 

Anti-Money Laundering 

We are subject to a significant number of AML laws and regulations as a result of being a financial company headquartered in the United States, as well as having a global presence. In the United States, the majority of AML requirements are derived from the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act and the accompanying regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (collectively referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act). The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (the AMLA), enacted in January 2021, amended the Bank Secrecy Act and is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. AML laws. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, the effects of which are not known at this time. In Europe, AML requirements are largely the result of countries transposing the 5th and 6th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives (and preceding EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives) into local laws and regulations. Numerous other countries, such as Argentina, Australia, Canada, India, Mexico, New Zealand and Russia, have also enacted or proposed new or enhanced AML legislation and regulations applicable to American Express. 

Among other things, these laws and regulations require us to establish AML programs that meet certain standards, including, in some instances, expanded reporting, particularly in the area of suspicious transactions, and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements. Our AML programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny in some countries, including certain Member States in the EU. Any errors, failures or delays in complying with AML and counter-terrorist financing laws, perceived deficiencies in our AML programs or association of our business with money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud or other illicit activity can give rise to significant supervisory, criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits, which could result in significant penalties and forfeiture of assets, loss of licenses or restrictions on business activities, or other enforcement actions. 

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 

The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. The United States prohibits U.S. persons from engaging with individuals and entities identified as &#8220;Specially Designated Nationals,&#8221; such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers. These prohibitions are administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and are typically known as the OFAC rules. The OFAC rules prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in financial transactions with or relating to the prohibited individual, entity or country, require the blocking of assets in which the individual, entity or country has an interest, and prohibit transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons) to such individual, entity or country. Blocked assets (e.g., property or bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. We maintain a global sanctions program designed to ensure compliance with OFAC requirements. Failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to serious legal and reputational consequences, including criminal penalties. 

Table of Contents 

Anti-Corruption 

We are subject to complex international and U.S. anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and other laws that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments. The FCPA makes it illegal to corruptly offer or provide anything of value to foreign government officials, political parties or political party officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or an improper advantage. The FCPA also requires us to strictly comply with certain accounting and internal controls standards. The UK Bribery Act also prohibits commercial bribery and the receipt of a bribe, and makes it a corporate offense to fail to prevent bribery by an associated person, in addition to prohibiting improper payments to foreign government officials. Failure of the Company, our subsidiaries, colleagues, contractors or agents to comply with the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and other similar laws can expose us and/or individual colleagues to investigation, prosecution and potentially severe criminal and civil penalties. 

Compensation Practices 

Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The federal banking regulators&#8217; guidance on sound incentive compensation practices sets forth three key principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not encourage imprudent risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking organizations. The three principles provide that a banking organization&#8217;s incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risks, (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#8217;s board of directors. Any deficiencies in our compensation practices that are identified by the banking regulators in connection with their review of our compensation practices may be incorporated into our supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against us if our incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes are determined to pose a risk to our safety and soundness, and we have not taken prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 

In May 2016, the federal banking regulators, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the National Credit Union Administration re-proposed a rule, originally proposed in 2011, on incentive-based compensation practices. The re-proposed rule would apply deferral, downward adjustment and forfeiture, and clawback requirements to incentive-based compensation arrangements granted to senior executive officers and significant risk-takers of covered institutions, with specific requirements varying based on the asset size of the covered institution and the category of employee. If these or other regulations are adopted in a form similar to what has been proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our colleagues, which could adversely affect our ability to hire, retain and motivate key colleagues.

Our business as a whole has not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations, although network volumes tend to be moderately higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters. As a result, the amount of Card Member loans and receivables outstanding tend to be moderately higher during that quarter. The average discount rate also tends to be slightly lower during the fourth quarter due to a higher level of retail-related billed business.
