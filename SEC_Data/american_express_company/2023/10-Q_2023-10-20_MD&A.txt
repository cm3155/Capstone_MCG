(c) Return on average equity (ROE) is calculated by dividing (i) annualized net income for the period by (ii) average shareholders&#8217; equity for the period. 

(d) Net interest yield on average Card Member loans reflects adjusted net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Adjusted net interest income and net interest yield on average Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to Table 8 for a reconciliation to Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans. 

Business Environment 

Our results for the third quarter reflect the continued momentum we have built in our business. Card Member spending, new account acquisitions and credit performance demonstrate the strength of our differentiated business model, which drove net income of $2.5 billion, or $3.30 per share, for the third quarter, compared with net income of $1.9 billion, or $2.47 per share, a year ago. 

Worldwide network volumes for the third quarter increased 7 percent compared to the prior year. Billed business, which represented 87 percent of our total network volumes and is the most significant driver of our financial results, increased 8 percent year-over-year. Goods &#38; Services (G&#38;S) spend increased 6 percent year-over-year, and Travel &#38; Entertainment (T&#38;E) spend grew by 13 percent, reflecting continued demand for travel and dining experiences across geographies and customer types. U.S. Consumer Services billed business grew by 9 percent year-over-year, with the largest portion of this growth coming from our Millennial and Gen-Z Card Members. International Card Services billed business grew by 18 percent year-over-year (15 percent on an FX-adjusted basis 1 ), driven by continued growth in spend across both consumer and commercial customers outside the U.S. Billed business in our Commercial Services segment grew by 1 percent on a year-over-year basis, reflecting continued slow growth from U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise (SME) Card Members and flat year-over-year billings for U.S. large and global corporate clients. 

Total revenues net of interest expense increased 13 percent year-over-year. The growth in billed business drove a 7 percent increase in Discount revenue, our largest revenue line. Net card fees increased 20 percent year-over-year, reflecting the high levels of new card acquisition and Card Member retention over the past several quarters, as well as our cycle of product refreshes. Net interest income increased 34 percent versus the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in the interest-bearing portion of our total loans and Card Member receivables. 

Total loans and Card Member receivables increased 15 percent year-over-year, as our Card Members continue to spend and rebuild balances. Provisions for credit losses increased, primarily driven by higher net write-offs, as write-off rates were near historic lows in the prior-year period, and reflected the strong growth in total loans and Card Member receivables, partially offset by a lower net reserve build in the current period. Net write-off and delinquency rates remained best-in-class, supported by our premium global customer base and our strong focus on risk management. 

Card Member rewards, Card Member services and Business development expenses are generally correlated to volumes or are variable based on usage and increased year-over-year primarily due to network volume growth and higher usage of travel-related benefits. Marketing expense decreased 15 percent for the three month period, due to management decisions impacting the timing of spend on customer acquisition and engagement through the full year. We continue to invest in acquiring high spending, high quality Card Members while driving efficiencies in marketing spend. Operating expenses increased 10 percent year-over-year, primarily driven by higher compensation expense and technology costs to support business growth. We remain focused on driving operating expense efficiencies, while continuing to invest in our growth strategy. 

During the third quarter, we maintained our capital ratios within our current target range of 10 to 11 percent and returned $1.7 billion of capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and common stock dividends. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while managing our CET1 capital ratio within our target range and supporting our balance sheet growth. Our robust capital, funding and liquidity positions provide us with significant flexibility to maintain a strong balance sheet. 

While we recognize the uncertainty of the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, our performance continues to give us confidence in our business model, and we remain committed to executing on our strategy to deliver sustainable and profitable long-term growth. 

See &#8220;Certain Legislative, Regulatory and Other Developments&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for information on certain matters that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 

1 The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency conversion into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared). FX-adjusted revenues is a non-GAAP measure. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense 

Discount revenue increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by increases in billed business. See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance. 

Net card fees increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by growth in our premium card portfolios. 

Service fees and other revenue increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to foreign exchange related revenues associated with Card Member cross-currency spending and growth in delinquency fees. 

Processed revenue increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by increases in network partner volumes, partially offset for the three month period by a decrease in volumes associated with the decommission of one of our alternative payment solutions. See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on processed volume performance. 

Interest income increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher interest rates and growth in revolving loan balances. 

Interest expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher interest rates paid on customer deposits.

Provisions for Credit Losses 

Card Member loans provision for credit losses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to higher net write-offs and higher reserve builds in the current periods. The reserve builds in the current periods were primarily driven by increases in loans outstanding and higher delinquencies. The reserve builds in the prior periods were primarily driven by increases in loans outstanding and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook at that time, partially offset, for the prior nine month period, by a reduction in COVID-19 pandemic-driven reserves. 

Card Member receivables provision for credit losses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to higher net write-offs, partially offset by reserve releases in the current periods versus reserve builds in the prior periods. The reserve releases in the current periods were primarily driven by lower delinquencies. The reserve builds in the prior periods were primarily driven by higher delinquencies and, for the prior nine month period, an increase in receivables outstanding. 

Other provision for credit losses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to higher net write-offs and reserve builds in the current periods. The reserve builds in the current periods were primarily driven by increases in other loans outstanding.

Expenses 

Card Member rewards expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by increases in Membership Rewards and cash back rewards expenses, collectively, of $50 million and $691 million, and cobrand rewards expense of $174 million and $552 million for the three and nine month periods, respectively, all of which were primarily driven by higher billed business, partially offset in the three month period by the impact of changes in expected redemption behavior associated with certain products. 

The Membership Rewards Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) for current program participants was 96 percent (rounded down) at both September 30, 2023 and 2022. 

Business development expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to increased partner payments driven by higher contractual rates and network volumes. 

Card Member services expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to higher usage of travel-related benefits. 

Marketing expense decreased for both the three and nine month periods, reflecting lower levels of spending on customer acquisitions and other growth initiatives. 

Salaries and employee benefits expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher compensation costs reflecting an increase in our colleague base to support business growth, with the three month period also driven by higher incentive compensation expenses. 

Other expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher technology costs and, for the nine month period, higher net losses on Amex Ventures investments. 

Income Taxes 

The effective tax rate was 20.9 percent and 23.6 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 19.5 percent and 23.0 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The lower effective tax rates for the three and nine month periods primarily reflected discrete tax benefits in the current periods and changes in the geographic mix of income.

(a) We present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, as our practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of our total provision for credit losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented. 

(b) A net write-off rate based on principal losses only is not available for corporate receivables due to system constraints. 

(c) For corporate receivables, delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due. Refer to Table 12 for 90+ days past billing metrics for corporate receivables. 

(d) Other includes foreign currency translation adjustments.

(c) Adjusted net interest income and net interest yield on average Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to &#8220;Glossary of Selected Terminology&#8221; for the definitions of these terms. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and is a component of net interest yield on average Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net interest yield on average Card Member loans reflects adjusted net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis, a GAAP measure, includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the Card Member loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on average Card Member loans. 

Business Segment Results of Operations

U.S. Consumer Services issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards and provides services to U.S. consumers, including travel and lifestyle services as well as banking and non-card financing products. 

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE 

Non-interest revenues increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher Discount revenue and Net card fees. 

Discount revenue increased 9 percent and 12 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, primarily driven by increases in U.S. consumer billed business. See Tables 5, 6 and 10 for more details on billed business performance. 

Net card fees increased 20 percent and 23 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, primarily driven by growth in our premium card portfolios. 

Service fees and other revenue was flat for the three month period and increased 6 percent for the nine month period. The increase in the nine month period was primarily driven by higher travel commissions and fees from our consumer travel business, as well as growth in delinquency fees, partially offset by the change in the allocation of TLS revenues described above, which wholly offset the increase in revenues for the three month period. 

Interest income increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher interest rates and growth in revolving loan balances. 

Interest expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by a higher cost of funds. 

PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

Card Member loans provision for credit losses increased for both the three and nine month periods. The increase in the three month period was primarily due to higher net write-offs and a higher reserve build in the current period. The increase in the nine month period was primarily due to a reserve build in the current period versus a reserve release in the prior period and higher net write-offs. The reserve builds in the current periods were primarily driven by increases in loans outstanding and higher delinquencies. The reserve build in the prior three month period was driven by an increase in loans outstanding and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook at that time. The reserve release in the prior nine month period was primarily driven by reduction in COVID-19 pandemic-driven reserves, partially offset by an increase in loans outstanding and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook at that time. 

Card Member receivables provision for credit losses increased for both the three and nine month periods. The increase in the three month period was primarily due to higher net write-offs, partially offset by a lower reserve build in the current period. The increase in the nine month period was primarily due to higher net write-offs, partially offset by a reserve release in the current period versus a reserve build in the prior period. The reserve build in the current three month period was primarily driven by higher delinquencies. The reserve release in the current nine month period was primarily driven by lower delinquencies. The reserve builds in the prior periods were primarily driven by higher delinquencies, partially offset in the prior three month period by a decrease in receivables outstanding. 

EXPENSES 

Total expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods. The increase in the three month period was primarily driven by higher Business development expense, as well as an increase in allocated service costs. The increase in the nine month period was primarily driven by higher Card Member rewards expense, an increase in allocated service costs and higher Card Member services expense. 

Card Member rewards expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher billed business, partially offset by the impact of changes in expected redemption behavior associated with certain products. 

Business development expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to increased partner payments driven by higher contractual rates and increases in billed business. 

Card Member services expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher usage of travel-related benefits. 

Marketing expense decreased for both the three and nine month periods, reflecting lower levels of spending on customer acquisitions and other growth initiatives. 

Salaries and employee benefits and other expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to an increase in allocated service costs.

Commercial Services issues a wide range of proprietary corporate and small business cards and provides services to U.S. businesses, including payment and expense management, banking and non-card financing products. CS also issues proprietary corporate cards and provides services to select global corporate clients. 

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE 

Non-interest revenues increased for both the three and nine month periods. The increase in the three month period was primarily driven by higher Service fees and other revenue, as well as higher Net Card fees. The increase in the nine month period was primarily driven by higher Discount revenue and Service fees and other revenue. 

Discount revenue increased 1 percent and 5 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, primarily driven by increases in commercial billed business. See Tables 5, 6 and 12 for more details on billed business performance. 

Net card fees increased 15 percent and 19 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, primarily driven by growth in our premium card portfolios. 

Service fees and other revenue increased 54 percent and 62 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, primarily driven by the change in the allocation of TLS revenues described above, as well as growth in delinquency fees. 

Interest income increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher interest rates and growth in revolving loan balances. 

Interest expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by a higher cost of funds. 

PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

Card Member loans provision for credit losses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to higher net write-offs and higher reserve builds in the current periods. The reserve builds for the current periods were primarily driven by increases in loans outstanding and higher delinquencies. The reserve builds in the prior periods were primarily driven by increases in loans outstanding, deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook at that time and higher delinquencies. The reserve build in the prior nine month period was partially offset by reductions in COVID-19 pandemic-driven reserves. 

Card Member receivables provision for credit losses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to higher net write-offs, partially offset by reserve releases in the current periods versus reserve builds in the prior periods. The reserve releases in the current periods were driven by lower delinquencies and decreases in receivables outstanding. The reserve builds in the prior periods were primarily driven by higher delinquencies and, for the prior nine month period, an increase in receivables outstanding. 

EXPENSES 

Total expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by an increase in allocated service costs. The increase in the nine month period was also driven by higher Card Member rewards expense. 

Card Member rewards expense was relatively flat for the three month period and increased for the nine month period. The increase in the nine month period was primarily driven by a larger proportion of spend in categories that earn higher levels of rewards, as well as higher billed business. 

Business development expense was relatively flat for the three month period and increased for the nine month period. The increase in the nine month period was primarily due to increased partner payments, primarily driven by higher billed business. 

Card Member services expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher usage of travel-related benefits. 

Marketing expense decreased for both the three and nine month periods, reflecting lower levels of spending on customer acquisitions and other growth initiatives. 

Salaries and employee benefits and other expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to an increase in allocated service costs.

In addition, if we initiate collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member receivable balance is classified as 90 days past billing. Corporate receivables delinquency data for periods other than 90+ days past billing and the net write-off rate based on principal losses only are not available due to system constraints.

ICS also provides services to our international customers, including travel and lifestyle services, and manages certain international joint ventures and our loyalty coalition businesses. 

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE 

Non-interest revenues increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher Discount revenue and Net card fees. 

Discount revenue increased 17 percent and 18 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively (14 percent and 20 percent on an FX-adjusted basis), primarily reflecting increases in billed business. 2 See Tables 5, 6 and 14 for more details on billed business performance. 

Net card fees increased 22 percent and 16 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively (19 percent and 18 percent on an FX-adjusted basis), primarily driven by growth in our premium card portfolios. 2 

Service fees and other revenue increased 10 percent for both the three and nine month periods (3 percent and 8 percent on an FX-adjusted basis), primarily driven by foreign exchange related revenues associated with Card Member cross-currency spending and growth in delinquency fees. 2 

Interest income increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by growth in revolving loan balances and higher interest rates. 

Interest expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by a higher cost of funds. 

2 Refer to footnote 1 on page 3 for details regarding foreign currency adjusted information. 

PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

Card Member loans provision for credit losses decreased for the three month period, primarily due to a reserve release in the current period versus a reserve build in the prior period, partially offset by higher net write-offs. The reserve release in the current period was primarily driven by the performance of portfolios in certain international markets. Card Member loans provision for credit losses increased for the nine month period, primarily due to higher net write-offs, partially offset by a lower reserve build in the current period. The reserve build in the current nine month period was primarily driven by an increase in loans outstanding, partially offset by the performance of portfolios in certain international markets. The reserve builds in the prior periods were primarily driven by higher delinquencies and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook at that time. 

Card Member receivables provision for credit losses decreased for the three month period, primarily due to a reserve release in the current period versus a reserve build in the prior period, partially offset by higher net write-offs. Card Member receivables provision for credit losses increased for the nine month period, primarily due to higher write-offs, partially offset by a reserve release in the current period versus a reserve build in the prior period. The reserve releases in the current periods were primarily driven by lower delinquencies, partially offset by increases in receivables outstanding. The reserve builds in the prior periods were primarily driven by higher delinquencies. 

EXPENSES 

Total expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher Card Member rewards expense and an increase in allocated service costs. 

Card Member rewards expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher billed business, partially offset in the three month period by the impact of changes in expected redemption behavior associated with certain products. 

Business development expense increased for the three month period and decreased for the nine month period. Both the three and nine month periods reflect increases in client incentives and partner payment expenses driven by higher billed business, which was offset in the nine month period by a prior-year charge related to revenue allocated to a joint venture partner. 

Card Member services expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher usage of travel-related benefits. 

Marketing expense decreased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to elevated levels of spending on growth initiatives in the prior periods. 

Salaries and employee benefits and other expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to an increase in allocated service costs.

In addition, if we initiate collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member receivable balance is classified as 90 days past billing. Corporate receivables delinquency data for periods other than 90+ days past billing and the net write-off rate based on principal losses only are not available due to system constraints.

GMNS manages our partnership relationships with third-party card issuers (including our network partnership agreements in China), merchant acquirers and a prepaid reloadable and gift card program manager, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of the global network. 

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE 

Non-interest revenues increased across all revenue categories for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher Discount revenue and Service fees and other revenues. 

Discount revenue increased 6 percent and 9 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, primarily driven by increases in billed business. See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance. 

Service fees and other revenue increased 10 percent and 14 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, primarily due to higher foreign exchange related revenues associated with Card Member cross-currency spending. 

Processed revenue increased 4 percent and 8 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, primarily driven by higher processed volumes. 

GMNS receives an interest expense credit relating to internal transfer pricing due to its merchant payables. Net interest income increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to higher interest expense credits, largely driven by higher interest rates. 

EXPENSES 

Total expenses decreased for the three month period and increased for the nine month period. The decrease in the three month period was primarily due to lower Business development expense, partially offset by higher Operating expenses. The increase in the nine month period was primarily driven by higher Operating expenses. 

Business development expense decreased for the three month period and increased for the nine month period. The increase in the nine month period was due to increased partner payments driven by higher network volumes, which was more than offset in the three month period by certain discrete partner payments in the prior year. 

Marketing expense decreased for the three month period and increased for the nine month period. The decrease in the three month period was driven by management decisions impacting the timing of spend to drive growth momentum and support merchant engagement. The increase in the nine month period was primarily driven by higher levels of spending on merchant engagement and other growth initiatives. 

Salaries and employee benefits and other expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to higher compensation costs and higher allocated service costs. 

Corporate &#38; Other 

Corporate functions and certain other businesses are included in Corporate &#38; Other. 

Corporate &#38; Other pretax loss was $709 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to a pretax loss of $582 million for the same period in the prior year, and pretax loss was $1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to a pretax loss of $1.6 billion for the same period in the prior year. The increase in pretax loss for the three month period was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation. The increase in pretax loss for the nine month period was primarily driven by higher deferred compensation costs and net losses on Amex Ventures investments. 

CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 

Our balance sheet management objectives are to maintain: 

&#8226; A solid and flexible equity capital profile; 

&#8226; A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements; and 

&#8226; Liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve month period in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. 

We continue to see volatility in the capital markets due to a variety of factors and manage our balance sheet to reflect evolving circumstances. 

Capital 

We believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value. Our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by colleagues, to maintain a strong balance sheet, provide flexibility to support future business growth, and distribute excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. See &#8220;Dividends and Share Repurchases&#8221; below. 

We seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of our minimum regulatory requirements, specifically within a 10 to 11 percent target range for American Express Company&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) risk-based capital ratio. 

We maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital and liquidity positions at the American Express parent company level or at our subsidiaries. 

We report our capital ratios using the Basel III capital definitions and the Basel III standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets. 

On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would significantly revise U.S. regulatory capital requirements for large banking organizations, including American Express Company and American Express National Bank (AENB). See &#8220;Certain Legislative, Regulatory and Other Developments &#8213; Basel III Proposal&#8221; for more information. 

The following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital and leverage ratios and those of our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, as of September 30, 2023:

The following table presents American Express Company&#8217;s regulatory risk-based capital and risk-weighted assets as of September 30, 2023:

4.0 &#160; Total Capital 28.0 &#160; Risk-Weighted Assets 209.4 &#160; Average Total Assets to calculate the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio $ 240.9 &#160; 

The following are definitions for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance: 

Risk-Weighted Assets &#8212; Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets. 

Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio &#8212; Calculated as CET1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital is common shareholders&#8217; equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets and certain deferred tax assets. CET1 capital is also adjusted for the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) final rules, as described below. 

Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio &#8212; Calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1 capital, preferred shares and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We have $1.6 billion of preferred shares outstanding to help address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. 

Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio &#8212; Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of allowance for credit losses adjusted for the CECL final rules (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets) and $1,370 million of eligible subordinated notes, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The $1,370 million of eligible subordinated notes includes the $500 million subordinated debt issued in July 2023, the $750 million subordinated debt issued in May 2022, and the $120 million remaining Tier 2 capital credit for the $600 million subordinated debt issued in December 2014. 

Tier 1 Leverage Ratio &#8212; Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. 

We elected to delay the recognition of $0.7 billion of reduction in regulatory capital from the adoption of the CECL methodology for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in period at 25 percent once per year beginning January 1, 2022, pursuant to rules issued by federal banking regulators (the CECL final rules). As of January 1, 2023, we have phased in 50 percent of such amount. 

We continue to include accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in regulatory capital. 

As a Category IV firm, we are not subject to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s supervisory stress tests in 2023. We submitted our annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve in April 2023. On July 27, 2023 the Federal Reserve confirmed our SCB of 2.5 percent, which resulted in a minimum CET1 ratio of 7 percent, effective October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024. 

Dividends and Share Repurchases 

We return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and generally more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we returned $1.7 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of $0.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, and share repurchases of $1.3 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. We repurchased 7.9 million common shares at an average price of $162.03 in the third quarter of 2023. 

In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid $14 million and $43 million, respectively, in dividends on non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares outstanding. 

Funding Strategy 

Our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to finance our global businesses and to maintain a strong liquidity profile. 

We aim to satisfy our financing needs with a diverse set of funding sources. The diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by tenor and by investor base, among other factors, mitigates the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, tenor or investor. We seek to achieve diversity and cost efficiency in our funding sources by maintaining scale and market relevance in deposits, unsecured debt and asset securitizations, and access to secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility. 

Summary of Consolidated Debt 

We had the following customer deposits and consolidated debt outstanding as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022: 

Table 18: Summary of Customer Deposits and Consolidated Debt (Billions) September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Customer deposits $ 124.4 &#160; $ 110.2 Short-term borrowings 1.6 &#160; 1.3 Long-term debt 46.4 &#160; 42.6 Total customer deposits and debt $ 172.4 &#160; $ 154.1 

We may redeem from time to time certain debt securities prior to the original contractual maturity dates in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of those debt securities. 

Our funding needs are driven by, among other factors, maturing obligations, our liquidity position and the pace of growth in our loans and receivables balances. Actual funding activities can vary from our plans due to various factors, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity and funding needs, demand for securities offered by us, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell loans and receivables, and the performance of loans and receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. Many of these factors are beyond our control. 

We issued $11.0 billion of debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisting of $7.5 billion of unsecured debt and $3.5 billion of asset-backed securities. The following table presents our debt issuances for the three months ended September 30, 2023:

Our equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody&#8217;s Investor Services (Moody&#8217;s), Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s (S&#38;P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Such ratings help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. Our asset securitization activities are rated separately.

These ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any of our securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization. 

Downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused credit facilities. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the FDIC to total funding, should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs. 

On August 29, 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that proposed long-term debt requirements that, if adopted as proposed, would require covered bank holding companies such as American Express Company to issue and maintain minimum amounts of eligible external long-term debt with specific terms for purposes of absorbing losses or recapitalizing the covered bank holding company and its operating subsidiaries. The notice of proposed rulemaking also proposed requiring minimum amounts of eligible internal long-term debt to be maintained by certain insured depository institutions that have at least $100 billion in consolidated assets, such as AENB, for purposes of absorbing losses or recapitalizing the insured depository institution. 

Deposit Programs 

We offer deposits within our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB. These funds are currently insured up to an amount that is at least $250,000 per account holder through the FDIC; as of September 30, 2023, approximately 92 percent of these deposits were insured. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on, among other factors, the capital level of AENB. Direct retail deposits offered by AENB is our primary deposit product channel, which makes FDIC-insured high-yield savings account, certificates of deposit (CDs), business checking and consumer rewards checking account products available directly to customers. As of September 30, 2023, our direct retail deposit program had approximately 2.2 million accounts. AENB also sources deposits through third-party distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives. 

As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $124.4 billion and $110.2 billion, respectively, in deposits. Refer to Note 6 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for a further description of these deposits and scheduled maturities of certificates of deposits. 

Liquidity Management 

Our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. 

Our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to: 

&#8226; Maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the &#8220;Funding Strategy&#8221; section for more details); 

&#8226; Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources; 

&#8226; Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios; and 

&#8226; Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements. 

The amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. 

We believe that we currently maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all internal and regulatory liquidity requirements. 

As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $43.9 billion and $33.9 billion in Cash and cash equivalents, respectively. Refer to the &#8220;Cash Flows&#8221; section below for a discussion of the major drivers impacting cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The investment income we receive on liquidity resources has historically been less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. From time to time, including in this quarter, interest income may exceed the interest expense associated with the liquidity portfolio. Depending on the interest rate environment, our funding composition and the amount of liquidity resources we maintain, the level of future net interest income or expense associated with our liquidity resources will vary. 

Securitized Borrowing Capacity 

As of September 30, 2023, we maintained committed, revolving, secured borrowing facilities that give us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust) and up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust). On July 26, 2023, we extended the Charge Trust&#8217;s facility by two years to mature on July 15, 2026 and on September 15, 2023, we extended the Lending Trust&#8217;s facility by two years to mature on September 15, 2026, and increased the maximum face amount of eligible AAA certificates that can be sold using this facility from $2.0 billion to $3.0 billion. These facilities enhance our contingent funding resources and are also used in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs. As of September 30, 2023, no amounts were drawn on the Charge Trust facility or Lending Trust facility. 

Committed Bank Credit Facility 

As of September 30, 2023, we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility of $3.5 billion, with a maturity date of October 15, 2024. This facility enhances our contingent funding resources and is also used in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs. As of September 30, 2023, no amount was drawn on this facility. 

Other Sources of Liquidity 

In addition to cash and other liquid assets and the secured borrowing facilities and committed bank credit facility described above, as an insured depository institution, AENB may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco through the discount window against its credit card loans and charge card receivables. Further, in March 2023, the Federal Reserve established an additional facility, the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). The BTFP offers loans of up to one year in length to banks and other eligible depository institutions against U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral. Any qualifying assets pledged to the BTFP are valued at par by the Federal Reserve for the purpose of determining the amount of collateral we can borrow against. The amount of borrowing capacity available to AENB at either the discount window or the BTFP is subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge. 

As of September 30, 2023, AENB had available borrowing capacity of $67.3 billion as a result of U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that were pledged to the Federal Reserve through the discount window. It also had approximately $1.0 billion in U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities that could be pledged through the BTFP. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by AENB can generally be used only to fund obligations within AENB, and transfers to the parent company or non-bank affiliates may be subject to prior regulatory approval. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we did not borrow from either the discount window or the BTFP and no amounts were outstanding on either facility at the end of the period. 

Unused Credit Outstanding 

As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately $377 billion of unused credit outstanding, primarily available to customers as part of established lending product agreements. Total unused credit outstanding does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. Our charge card products generally have no pre-set spending limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit outstanding. 

Cash Flows 

The following table summarizes our cash flow activity, followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating, investing and financing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30: 

Table 21: Cash Flows (Billions) 2023 2022 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 11.8 &#160; $ 12.6 Investing activities (16.3) (22.9) Financing activities 14.3 &#160; 18.9 Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 0.2 &#160; 0.5 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 10.0 &#160; $ 9.1 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

Our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income, such as provisions for credit losses, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred taxes and other non-cash items and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments. 

In 2023, the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by cash generated from net income for the period and higher net operating liabilities, primarily resulting from higher accounts payable to merchants and an increase in Membership Rewards liability, partially offset by payments related to annual incentive compensation. 

In 2022, the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by cash generated from net income for the period and higher net operating liabilities, primarily resulting from higher accounts payable to merchants and an increase in Membership Rewards liability driven by higher Card Member spending. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

Our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in Card Member loans and receivables, as well as changes in our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. 

In 2023, the net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher Card Member loans and receivables outstanding, resulting from higher Card Member spending. 

In 2022, the net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher Card Member loans and receivables outstanding and net purchases of investment securities. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

Our cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits, long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as dividend payments and share repurchases. 

In both the periods presented, the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by growth in customer deposits and net proceeds from debt, partially offset by share repurchases and dividend payments. 

OTHER MATTERS 

Certain Legislative, Regulatory and Other Developments 

Supervision &#38; Regulation 

We are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, and the costs of compliance are substantial. The financial services industry is subject to rigorous scrutiny, high regulatory expectations, a range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment. 

Governmental authorities have focused, and we believe will continue to focus, considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms and payment systems with laws and regulations, and as a result, we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework, governance structures, practices and procedures. Reviews by us and governmental authorities to assess compliance with laws and regulations, as well as our own internal reviews to assess compliance with internal policies, including errors or misconduct by colleagues or third parties or control failures, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, changes to our products, practices and procedures, restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination. We have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions, including governmental inquiries, investigations, enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties, in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations. For example, as previously disclosed, we are cooperating with governmental investigations related to our historical sales practices, which are described in more detail in Note 7 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements.&#8221; External publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries. 

Please see the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; sections of the 2022 Form 10-K for further information. 

Basel III Proposal 

On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would significantly revise U.S. regulatory capital requirements for large banking organizations, including American Express Company and AENB. The proposed rules would apply a new expanded risk-based approach to calculating risk-based capital ratios, and large banking organizations would be required to calculate their risk-based capital ratios under both (i) the standardized approach and (ii) the expanded risk-based approach and use the lower of the two ratio calculations to determine binding capital constraints under each risk-based capital ratio. The expanded risk-based approach to calculating risk-weighted assets would apply more granular risk-weighting methodologies for, among others, credit, operational, market and equity risks, including differential treatment of fee and other non-interest revenues as compared to interest income for purposes of determining operational risk-weighted assets. The proposed rules would also include additional capital requirements for certain &#8220;unconditionally cancellable commitments&#8221; such as unused portions of committed lines of credit (e.g., credit cards), and would create a proxy methodology to assign capital requirements to credit exposure on products that carry no pre-set spending limits such as charge cards. 

Under the proposal, the revisions would become effective on July 1, 2025, subject to a three-year transition period for certain provisions, including phasing in the use of risk-weighted assets under the expanded risk-based approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of the proposal, but based on a preliminary analysis, we estimate that the increase in our risk-weighted assets under the expanded risk-based approach as currently proposed could consume the capital buffer between our minimum regulatory requirements and our current CET1 risk-based capital ratio. This estimated impact reflects our current understanding of the proposal, the application to our businesses as currently conducted and the current composition of our balance sheet, and therefore does not reflect the impact of any changes we may make in the future as a result of the expanded risk-based approach or otherwise. The ultimate impact will depend on the final rulemaking, future minimum regulatory requirements as well as management decisions regarding our product constructs, capital distributions and target capital levels, and there can be no assurance that the impact will not be more or less than currently estimated. 

Consumer Financial Products Regulation 

Our consumer-oriented activities are subject to regulation and supervision in the United States and internationally. In the United States, our marketing, sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit, savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#8221; acts or practices. In addition, a number of U.S. states have significant consumer credit protection, disclosure and other laws (in certain cases more stringent than U.S. federal laws). U.S. federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices, which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws, can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny. 

On February 1, 2023, the CFPB issued a proposed rule to lower the safe harbor amount that would be considered, by regulation, to be &#8220;reasonable and proportional&#8221; to the costs incurred by credit card issuers for late payments. The proposed rule would also eliminate the annual inflation adjustment for such safe harbor amount and prohibit late fee amounts above 25 percent of the consumer&#8217;s required minimum payment. 

On March 30, 2023, the CFPB adopted a final rule requiring covered financial institutions, such as us, to collect and report data to the CFPB regarding certain small business credit applications. Based on our small business credit transaction volume, we will be required to comply with this rule by October 1, 2024, subject to the outcome of litigation over the final rule facing the CFPB. 

For more information on consumer financial products regulation, as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business, please see the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; sections of the 2022 Form 10-K. 

Payments Regulation 

Legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks, including through enforcement actions, legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks, and, in some cases, to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems. 

The European Union (EU), Australia, Canada and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees (that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like Visa and Mastercard), as well as the rules, contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance. Regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly, as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants. Among other things, regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the discount revenue we earn, including as a result of downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants. For example, we exited our network business in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the EU payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. On August 29, 2023, the Dutch Trade and Industry Appeals Tribunal referred questions to the EU Court of Justice on the interpretation of the application of the interchange fee caps in connection with an administrative proceeding by the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets regarding our cobrand relationship with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. 

Broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include, in some cases, requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations, such as processing infrastructure and data storage, which increases our costs and could diminish the value of our closed loop. The development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network. 

For more information on payments regulation, as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business, please see the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; sections of the 2022 Form 10-K. 

Surcharging 

In various countries, such as certain Member States in the EU, Australia and Canada (other than in Quebec), merchants are permitted to surcharge card purchases. In addition, the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been overturned and certain states have passed or are considering laws to permit surcharging by merchants. Surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business. In addition, other steering or differential acceptance practices that are permitted by regulation in some jurisdictions could also have a material adverse effect on us. 

For more information on the potential impacts of surcharging and other actions that could impair the Card Member experience, please see the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section of the 2022 Form 10-K. 

Merchant Litigation 

We continue to vigorously defend antitrust and other claims initiated by merchants. See Note 7 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for descriptions of the cases. It is possible that actions impairing the Card Member experience, or the resolution of one or any combination of these merchant claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business. For more information on the potential impacts of an adverse decision in the merchant litigations on our business, please see the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section of the 2022 Form 10-K. 

Privacy, Data Protection, Data Governance, Information and Cyber Security 

Regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy, data protection, data governance, resiliency and information and cyber security continues to increase worldwide. We have established, and continue to maintain and enhance, policies and a governance framework to comply with applicable laws, meet evolving customer and industry expectations and support and enable business innovation and growth. Global financial institutions like us, as well as our customers, colleagues, regulators, service providers and other third parties, have experienced a significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing, impersonation and identity takeover attempts), corporate espionage, hacking, website defacement, denial-of-service attacks, exploitation of vulnerabilities and other attacks and similar disruptions from the misconfiguration or unauthorized use of or access to computer systems. For more information on privacy, data protection and information and cyber security regulation and the potential impacts of a major information or cyber security incident on our results of operations and business, please see the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; sections of the 2022 Form 10-K. 

Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism 

We are subject to significant supervision and regulation, and an increasingly stringent enforcement environment, with respect to compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) laws and regulations. In the United States, the majority of AML/CFT requirements are derived from the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act and the accompanying regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (collectively referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (the AMLA), enacted in January 2021, amended the Bank Secrecy Act and is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. AML/CFT laws. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, the effects of which are not known at this time. In Europe, AML/CFT requirements are largely the result of countries transposing the 5th and 6th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives (and preceding EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives) into local laws and regulations. Numerous other countries have also enacted or proposed new or enhanced AML/CFT legislation and regulations applicable to American Express. 

Among other things, these laws and regulations require us to establish AML/CFT programs that meet certain standards, including, in some instances, expanded reporting, particularly in the area of suspicious transactions, and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements. Our AML/CFT programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny in some countries, including certain Member States in the EU. Any errors, failures or delays in complying with AML/CFT laws, perceived deficiencies in our AML/CFT programs or association of our business with money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud or other illicit activity can give rise to significant supervisory, criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits, which could result in significant penalties and forfeiture of assets, loss of licenses or restrictions on business activities, or other enforcement actions. For more information on AML/CFT regulation, as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business, please see the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; sections of the 2022 Form 10-K. 

Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Standards 

Refer to the Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements.&#8221; 

Glossary of Selected Terminology 

Adjusted net interest income &#8212; A non-GAAP measure that represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans (which includes, on a GAAP basis, interest that is deemed uncollectible), excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans. 

Airline spend &#8212; Represents spend at airlines as a merchant, which is included within T&#38;E spend. 

Allocated service costs &#8212; Represents salaries and benefits associated with our technology and customer servicing groups, allocated based on activities directly attributable to our reportable operating segments, as well as overhead expenses, which are allocated to our reportable operating segments based on their relative levels of assets. 

Asset securitizations &#8212; Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Billed business (Card Member spending) &#8212; Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on payment products issued by American Express. 

Capital ratios &#8212; Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under &#8220;Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity&#8221; for further related definitions under Basel III. 

Card Member &#8212; The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded card. 

Card Member loans &#8212; Represents revolve-eligible transactions on our card products, as well as any interest charges and associated card-related fees. 

Card Member receivables &#8212; Represents transactions on our card products and card related fees that need to be paid in full on or before the Card Member&#8217;s payment due date. 

Cards-in-force &#8212; Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, except for retail cobrand cards issued by network partners that had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in-force is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base. 

Charge cards &#8212; Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member&#8217;s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Charge Card Members must pay the full amount of balances billed each month, with the exception of balances that can be revolved under lending features offered on certain charge cards, such as Pay Over Time and Plan It, that allow Card Members to pay for eligible purchases with interest over time. 

Cobrand cards &#8212; Represents cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial partners. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner&#8217;s own loyalty program. 

Credit cards &#8212; Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, structured payment features (e.g. Plan It), grace periods, and rate and fee structures. 

Discount revenue &#8212; Represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express. 

Goods &#38; Services (G&#38;S) spend &#8212; Includes spend in merchant categories other than T&#38;E-related merchant categories, which includes B2B spending by small and mid-sized enterprise customers in our CS and ICS segments. 

Interest expense &#8212; Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt. 

Interest income &#8212; Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other. 

Interest on loans &#8212; Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off. 

Interest and dividends on investment securities &#8212; Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. 

Interest income on deposits with banks and other &#8212; Primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. 

Loyalty coalitions &#8212; Programs that enable consumers to earn rewards points and use them to save on purchases from a variety of participating merchants through multi-category rewards platforms. Merchants in these programs generally fund the consumer offers and are responsible to us for the cost of rewards points; we earn revenue from operating the loyalty platform and by providing marketing support. 

Net card fees &#8212; Represents the card membership fees earned during the period recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs. 

Net interest yield on average Card Member loans &#8212; A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provision for credit losses and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation. 

Net write-off rate &#8212; principal only &#8212; Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan or receivable balance during the period. 

Net write-off rate &#8212; principal, interest and fees &#8212; Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans, and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables. 

Network volumes &#8212; Represents the total of billed business and processed volumes. 

Operating expenses &#8212; Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, data processing and equipment, and other expenses. 

Processed revenue &#8212; Represents revenues related to network partnership agreements, comprising royalties, fees and amounts earned for facilitating transactions on cards issued by network partners. Processed revenue also includes fees earned on alternative payment solutions facilitated by American Express. 

Processed volumes &#8212; Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards issued under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures, as well as alternative payment solutions facilitated by American Express. 

Reserve build (release) &#8212; Represents the portion of the provisions for credit losses for the period related to increasing or decreasing reserves for credit losses as a result of, among other things, changes in volumes, macroeconomic outlook, portfolio composition and credit quality of portfolios. Reserve build represents the amount by which the provision for credit losses exceeds net write-offs, while reserve release represents the amount by which net write-offs exceed the provision for credit losses. 

T&#38;E spend &#8212; Represents spend on travel and entertainment, which primarily includes airline, cruise, lodging and dining merchant categories.

&#8226; a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, processes or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyberattacks, which could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security of data, disrupt our operations, reduce the use and acceptance of American Express cards and lead to regulatory scrutiny, litigation, remediation and response costs, and reputational harm; 

&#8226; changes in capital and credit market conditions, which may significantly affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs and expectations regarding capital ratios; our access to capital and funding costs; the valuation of our assets; and our credit ratings or those of our subsidiaries; 

&#8226; our funding plan being implemented in a manner inconsistent with current expectations, which will depend on various factors such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities we offer, regulatory changes, our ability to securitize and sell loans and receivables and the performance of loans and receivables previously sold in securitization transactions;
