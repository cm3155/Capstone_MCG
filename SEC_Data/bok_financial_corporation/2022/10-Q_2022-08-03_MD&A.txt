Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Performance Summary

BOK Financial Corporation (“the Company”) reported net income of $132.8 million or $1.96 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2022 compared to
$62.5 million or $0.91 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2022. Increased fee income led by revenue growth from trading activities combined with higher
net interest revenue and decreased operating expenses to grow net income in the second quarter. First quarter trading revenue was negatively affected by
interest rate volatility and concern over rising inflation.

Pre-provision net revenue ("PPNR"), a non-GAAP measure, was $169.0 million for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $78.7 million for the first quarter
of 2022.

Highlights of the second quarter of 2022 included:

•

•

•

•

Net interest revenue totaled $274.0 million, an increase of $5.6 million compared to the first quarter of 2022. Average earning assets were $39.1
billion, a decrease of $4.4 billion, largely due to a reduction in our trading inventory. Net interest margin was 2.76 percent for the second quarter of
2022 compared to 2.44 percent for the prior quarter.

Fees and commissions revenue totaled $173.4 million, an increase of $75.7 million. Brokerage and trading revenue increased $71.1 million following
trading losses in the prior quarter. Revenue growth in all other fee-generating business activities was partially offset by a $5.3 million decrease in
mortgage banking revenue.

The net benefit of the changes in fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was $1.9 million for the second quarter of 2022
compared to a net cost of $8.4 million for the first quarter of 2022 due to reduced price sensitivity in the second quarter.

Other operating expense totaled $273.7 million, a decrease of $4.0 million. Personnel expense decreased $4.3 million, largely due to lower share-
based compensation expense. Non-personnel expense was relatively consistent with the prior quarter.

Period-end outstanding loan balances totaled $21.3 billion at June 30, 2022, growing $617 million compared to March 31, 2022, largely due to growth
in commercial loans. Excluding a decrease in loans originated through the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP"),
outstanding loan balances increased $711 million. Unfunded loan commitments also grew by $979 million during the second quarter. Average loan
balances increased $594 million compared to the prior quarter to $21.1 billion.

No provision for expected credit losses was necessary for the second quarter of 2022, consistent with the prior quarter. An increase in required
provision due to loan growth and changes in our economic outlook was offset by a sustained trend of improving credit quality metrics. The combined
allowance for credit losses totaled $283 million or 1.33 percent of outstanding loans, excluding PPP loans, at June 30, 2022. The combined allowance
for credit losses was $283 million or 1.38 percent of outstanding loans, excluding PPP loans, at March 31, 2022.

Nonperforming assets not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies decreased $13 million compared to March 31, 2022. Potential problem loans
decreased $39 million while other loans especially mentioned decreased $18 million. Net recoveries were $799 thousand or 0.02 percent of average
loans on an annualized basis for the second quarter of 2022, excluding PPP loans. Net charge-offs were 0.06 percent of average loans, excluding PPP
loans, over the last four quarters. Net charge-offs were $6.0 million or 0.12 percent of average loans on an annualized basis for the first quarter of
2022, excluding PPP loans.

Period-end deposits were $38.6 billion at June 30, 2022, an $807 million decrease compared to March 31, 2022 as customers begin to redeploy cash
resources to higher yielding alternatives and resume spending following the height of the pandemic. Average deposits decreased $1.8 billion, including
a $1.9 billion decrease in interest bearing deposits.

The common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at June 30, 2022 was 11.61 percent. Other regulatory capital ratios included the Tier 1 capital ratio at 11.63
percent, total capital ratio at 12.59 percent, and leverage ratio at 9.12 percent. At March 31, 2022, the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.30
percent, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.31 percent, total capital ratio was 12.25 percent, and leverage ratio was 8.47 percent.

The Company repurchased 294,084 shares of common stock at an average price of $82.98 per share in the second quarter of 2022 and 475,877 shares
at an average price of $101.02 in the first quarter of 2022. We view share buybacks opportunistically, but within the context of maintaining our strong
capital position.

The Company paid a regular cash dividend of $35.9 million or $0.53 per common share during the second quarter of 2022. On August 2, 2022, the
board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.53 per common share payable on or about August 25, 2022 to shareholders of record as of
August 16, 2022.

Highlights of the six months ended June 30, 2022 included:

•

•

•

•

•

Tax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $546.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and $565.4 million for the six months ended June
30, 2021. Net interest revenue decreased $16.3 million from changes in earning assets and $2.6 million from changes in interest rates. Net interest
margin was 2.60 percent compared to 2.61 percent. Average earning assets decreased $2.8 billion to $41.3 billion, primarily due to lower loan balances
and a reduction in trading securities. In response to rising inflation, the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate 150 basis points since the
beginning of 2022, which led to an 18 basis point increase in loan yields while funding costs only increased 4 basis points. PPP loan fees totaled $6.5
million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and $22.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. PPP loan fees remaining to be recognized
totaled $1.1 million as of June 30, 2022. The yield on trading securities decreased 19 basis points due to a lower weighted average coupon rate.

Fees and commissions revenue totaled $271.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, a $60.6 million decrease compared to the six months
ended June 30, 2021, largely due to a reduction in brokerage and trading revenue and mortgage banking revenue. A $58.8 million decrease in trading
revenue due to disruption in the fixed income markets related to economic uncertainty was partially offset by a $19.7 million increase in customer
hedging revenue. Mortgage banking revenue decreased $30.3 million as rapidly rising mortgage interest rates and continued inventory shortages have
adversely affected both loan production volume and margins. Other revenue decreased $16.3 million as a result of lower operating revenue from
repossessed oil and gas assets due to the sale of properties in the third quarter of 2021.

Other gains and losses, net decreased $35.9 million. The prior year included gains on alternative investments and sales of repossessed assets while the
current year included the write-down of a repossessed equity interest in a midstream entity.

Total operating expense was $551.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, a decrease of $35.7 million compared to the six months ended
June 30, 2021. Personnel expense decreased $30.9 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs related to reduced cash-based
incentives resulting from lower loan and trading volume and deferred compensation expense, which is largely offset by a decrease in the value of
related rabbi trust investments. Non-personnel expense decreased $4.8 million to $237.1 million. Lower mortgage banking costs and repossessed asset
operating expenses were largely offset by increased business promotion, occupancy and equipment, and data processing costs.

No provision for credit losses was necessary for the six months ended June 30, 2022. An increase in allowance related to our lending activities from
strong loan growth and changes in our reasonable and supportable forecast were offset by the impact from improving credit metrics. A $60.0 million
negative provision for credit losses was recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2021 due to forecasts for improving macroeconomic factors,
including stabilizing energy prices, and improving credit quality metrics.

Results of Operations

Net Interest Revenue and Net Interest Margin

Net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities, loans and other interest-earning assets less interest paid for interest-bearing deposits and other
borrowings. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest revenue by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the
difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically
greater than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity.

Tax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $276.1 million for the second quarter of 2022 and $270.4 million for the first quarter of 2022. Compared to the first
quarter of 2022, net interest revenue increased $18.3 million from changes in interest rates and decreased $12.6 million from changes in earning assets. Table 1
shows the effect on net interest revenue from changes in average balances and interest rates for various types of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

Average earning assets decreased $4.4 billion compared to the first quarter of 2022. Average trading securities were reduced by $4.4 billion as we reduced our
inventory of low-coupon residential mortgage-backed securities and repositioned the trading portfolio in response to rising mortgage interest rates. Average
loan balances increased $594 million, largely due to growth in commercial loans, partially offset by a reduction of PPP loans. The average balance of available
for sale securities, which consists largely of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, decreased
$834 million while investment securities increased $416 million. Late in the second quarter of 2022, we transferred $2.4 billion of U.S. government agency
mortgage-backed securities from available for sale to investment securities to limit the effect of future rate increases on the tangible common equity ratio. We
purchase securities to supplement earnings and to manage interest rate risk. Interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents decreased $207 million.

Total average deposits were reduced by $1.8 billion compared to the first quarter of 2022 as customers begin to deploy cash resources into higher yielding
alternatives and resume normal spending levels following the height of the pandemic. Funds purchased and repurchase agreements decreased $780 million
while other borrowings increased $153 million.

Net interest margin was 2.76 percent compared to 2.44 percent in the first quarter of 2022. The tax-equivalent yield on earning assets was 2.96 percent, an
increase of 38 basis points. Loan yields increased 35 basis points to 3.92 percent. The yield on trading securities was up 29 basis points to 2.00 percent. The
available for sale securities portfolio yield increased 7 basis points to 1.84 percent. The yield on fair value option securities increased 11 basis points to 2.92
percent. The yield on investment securities decreased 272 basis points due to the transfer of securities from the available for sale portfolio to the investment
portfolio. The yield on interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents increased 65 basis points.

Funding costs were 0.31 percent, a 10 basis point increase. The cost of interest bearing deposits increased 12 basis points to 0.24 percent. The cost of funds
purchased and repurchase agreements decreased 42 basis points to 0.53 percent while the cost of other borrowings increased 63 basis points to 1.01 percent.
The benefit to net interest margin from assets funded by non-interest liabilities was 11 basis points, an increase of 4 basis points.

Our overall objective is to manage the Company’s balance sheet for changes in interest rates as is further described in the Market Risk section of this report.
Approximately 78 percent of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate or fixed rate that will reprice within one
year. These loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either non-interest bearing, or that reprice more slowly than the loans. The result is a
balance sheet that would be asset sensitive, which means that assets generally reprice more quickly than liabilities. One of the strategies that we use to manage
toward a relative rate-neutral position is to purchase fixed rate residential mortgage-backed securities issued primarily by U.S. government agencies and fund
them with market-rate-sensitive liabilities. The liability-sensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the asset-sensitive characteristics of our loan
portfolio. We also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk. 

The effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in Table 1 and in the
interest rate sensitivity projections as shown in the Market Risk section of this report.

Other Operating Revenue

Other operating revenue was $168.6 million for the second quarter of 2022 and $87.9 million for the first quarter of 2022. Brokerage and trading revenue,
which was negatively impacted in the prior quarter by market volatility due to uncertainty surrounding rising inflation and interest rates, grew significantly in
the current quarter.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item.

Fees and commissions revenue

Diversified sources of fees and commissions revenue are a significant part of our business strategy and represented 39 percent of total revenue for the second
quarter of 2022, excluding provision for credit losses and gains and losses on other assets, securities and derivatives and the change in the fair value of
mortgage servicing rights. We believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to changes in interest rates, values in the equity markets,
commodity prices and consumer spending, all of which can be volatile. Many of the economic factors such as rising interest rates that we expect will result in
growth in net interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue may also decrease mortgage banking production volumes and related trading. The
velocity of changes in market conditions and interest rates may result in timing differences between when offsetting impacts and benefits are realized. As
interest rates are expected to move higher, we expect to experience increased benefits to our net interest margin, which provides an offset to reduced mortgage-
related fee income. Generally, for operating revenues not as directly related to movement in interest rates, we expect growth to come through offering new
products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets. However, current and future economic conditions, including the recent
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory constraints, increased competition and saturation in our existing markets could affect the rate of future
increases.

Brokerage and Trading Revenue

Brokerage and trading revenue, which includes revenues from trading, customer hedging, retail brokerage and investment banking, increased $71.1 million or
263 percent compared to the first quarter of 2022.

- 5 -

 
 
Trading revenue includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily related to residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S.
government agencies and related derivative instruments that enable our mortgage banking customers to manage their production risk. Trading revenue also
includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses on municipal securities and other financial instruments that we sell to institutional customers, along with
changes in the fair value of financial instruments we hold as economic hedges against market risk of our trading securities. Trading revenue increased $66.0
million compared to the prior quarter..Disruption in the fixed income markets related to uncertainty around rising inflation and interest rates adversely affected
the value of trading securities during the first quarter of 2022. During the second quarter, we fully sold our inventory of low-coupon, U.S. government agency
residential mortgage-backed securities.

Customer hedging revenue is based primarily on realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held for customer risk management
programs. As more fully discussed under Customer Derivative Programs in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, we offer commodity, interest rate,
foreign exchange and equity derivatives to our customers. Customer hedging revenue totaled $13.1 million for the second quarter of 2022, up $2.2 million over
the prior quarter. Customer hedging revenue includes credit valuation adjustments of the fair value of derivatives to reflect the risk of counterparty default.

Investment banking, which includes fees earned upon completion of underwriting, financial advisory services and loan syndication fees, totaled $11.8 million
for the second quarter of 2022, an increase of $4.2 million compared to the first quarter of 2022, related to the timing and volume of completed loan
syndication transactions.

Transaction Card Revenue

Transaction card revenue totaled $26.9 million for the second quarter of 2022, an increase of $2.7 million compared to the first quarter of 2022. Transaction
volume is rising as customers return to more normal spending levels following the height of the pandemic. , largely due to stimulus measures and the broader
reopening of the U.S. economy.
Fiduciary and Asset Management Revenue

Fiduciary and asset management revenue is earned through managing or holding of assets for customers and executing transactions or providing related
services. Approximately 90 percent of fiduciary and asset management revenue is primarily based on the fair value of assets. Rates applied to asset values vary
based on the nature of the relationship. Fiduciary relationships and managed asset relationships generally have higher fee rates than non-fiduciary and/or
managed relationships. Fiduciary and asset management revenue increased $3.4 million over the first quarter of 2022. Money market fund revenue share grew
$3.0 million. The second quarter also included an increase in seasonal tax preparation fees of $1.8 million and reduction of fee waivers of $2.1 million. We
voluntarily waived certain administration fees on the Cavanal Hill money market funds in order to maintain positive yields on these funds during the short-term
interest rate environment. As of June 30, 2022, we are no longer waiving those fees. These increases were partially offset by a $3.2 million reduction in trust
business line fees related to decreased asset under management billable fees, consistent with market driven declines in equities, which account for a third of the
assets under management or administration.

Assets under management as of June 30, 2022 consist of 44 percent fixed income, 34 percent equities, 14 percent cash, and 8 percent alternative investments.

Deposit Service Charges and Fees

Deposit service charges and fees increased $1.5 million driven largely by commercial customer activity. Overdraft and non-sufficient funds fees earned
primarily on consumer deposit accounts totaled $6.6 million for the second quarter of 2022, largely unchanged from the prior quarter.

Mortgage Banking Revenue

Mortgage banking revenue decreased $5.3 million or 32 percent compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to lower production volume combined with
narrowing margins. Rapidly rising interest rates and continued inventory shortages have resulted in fewer refinance opportunities and heightened competitive
pricing pressure. Mortgage production volume decreased $102 million to $306 million. Production revenue as a percentage of production volume, which
includes unrealized gains and losses on our mortgage commitment pipeline and related hedges, decreased 140 basis points to (0.16) percent, affected by
increased market competition and our securitization of loans previously repurchased from GNMA pools.

Net gains on other assets, securities and derivatives

Other gains and losses, net decreased $6.0 million compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily related to a write-down of a repossessed equity interest in a
midstream entity.

As discussed in the Market Risk section following, the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") changes in response to changes in primary
mortgage loan rates and other assumptions. We attempt to mitigate the earnings volatility caused by changes in the fair value of MSRs by designating certain
financial instruments as an economic hedge. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are generally expected to partially offset changes in the fair value of
MSRs. Three bulk mortgage servicing rights portfolios were acquired during the second quarter of 2022. These acquisitions added $3.5 billion in unpaid
principal balance comprised of conventional, low note rate, strong performing loans.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) are not meaningful for comparison purposes.

- 10 -

 
Personnel expense

Personnel expense decreased $4.3 million compared to the first quarter of 2022. Share-based compensation expense decreased $3.9 million resulting from
changes in vesting assumptions. Regular compensation expense increased as we recognized a full quarter of expense related to annual merit increases and
employee benefits expense decreased due to seasonal changes in payroll taxes. An increase in cash-based incentive compensation expense was largely driven
by growing commercial activity. A decrease in deferred compensation expense reflected changes in the value of rabbi trust assets.

Non-personnel operating expense

Non-personnel expense totaled $118.7 million for the second quarter of 2022, consistent with the first quarter of 2022. Mortgage banking costs increased $1.6
million, primarily due to additional accruals related to default servicing and loss mitigation costs on loans serviced for others. Increases in data processing and
communications expense of $1.4 million and professional fees and services expense of $1.1 million were due to ongoing technology projects. These increases
were offset by a decrease in net occupancy and equipment expense of $3.4 million.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 21.4 percent for the second quarter of 2022 and 20.6 percent for the first quarter of 2022. The effective rate for the second quarter of
2022 increased primarily due to the increase in net income before tax. The effective tax rates for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 were
21.1 percent and 22.6 percent, respectively. The effective rate decreased primarily due to the increase in excess tax benefits from vested share-based
compensation and a decrease in the Oklahoma tax rate.

Lines of Business

We operate three principal lines of business: Commercial Banking, Consumer Banking and Wealth Management. Commercial Banking includes lending,
treasury and cash management services and customer risk management products for small businesses, middle market and larger commercial
customers. Commercial Banking also includes the TransFund EFT network. Consumer Banking includes retail lending and deposit services, lending and
deposit services to small business customers served through our consumer branch network and all mortgage banking activities. Wealth Management provides
fiduciary services, private banking services, insurance and investment advisory services in all markets. Wealth Management also underwrites state and
municipal securities and engages in brokerage and trading activities.

In addition to our lines of business, we have a Funds Management unit. The primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest
rate risk. Each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the Funds Management unit as needed to support their operations. Operating results
for Funds Management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities, securities gains and losses including
impairment charges, the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off, tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are
not attributed to the lines of business.

We allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution, which includes the allocation of funds and capital
costs. Credit costs are attributed to the lines of business based on net loans charged off or recovered. The difference between credit costs attributed to the lines
of business and the consolidated provision for credit losses is attributed to Funds Management. In addition, we measure the performance of our business lines
after allocations of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on statutory rates.

The cost of funds borrowed from the Funds Management unit by the operating lines of business is transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for
funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics. Market rates are generally based on the applicable wholesale borrowing rates or interest rate swap
rates, adjusted for prepayment risk and liquidity risk. This method of transfer-pricing funds that support assets of the operating lines of business tends to
insulate them from interest rate risk.

- 11 -

The value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the Funds Management unit is also based on rates that approximate wholesale market rates for
funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics. Market rates are generally based on a proxy of wholesale borrowing rates or interest rate swap
rates. The funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their repricing characteristics reflected in a
combination of the short-term wholesale funding rate and a moving average of an intermediate term swap rate, with an appropriate spread applied to
both. Shorter duration products are weighted towards the short term wholesale funding rates and longer duration products are weighted towards the
intermediate swap rates. The expected duration ranges from 30 days for certain rate-sensitive deposits to five years.

Economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects management’s assessment of risk. This model assigns capital based
upon credit, operating, interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units. The level of
assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line, based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where
possible. Average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts we have invested in the lines of business.

As shown in Table 8, net income attributable to our lines of business increased $62.8 million compared to the first quarter of 2022. Net interest revenue
increased $18.1 million, primarily due to loan growth and increased spreads on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit. Net charge-offs decreased $6.8
million. Other operating revenue increased $62.1 million largely due to trading activity returning to more normal levels following trading losses incurred in the
prior quarter from market disruptions. Operating expense increased $10.5 million due to a combination of increased incentive compensation expense largely
related to growing commercial activity and additional accruals for mortgage loan default servicing and loss mitigation costs.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item.

Net interest revenue increased $29.5 million or 22 percent over the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to loan growth and increased spreads on deposits sold to
the Funds Management unit.

Fees and commissions revenue increased $2.9 million or 5 percent, largely due to the timing of loan syndication activity. Operating expense increased $4.9
million or 8 percent compared to the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to increased incentive compensation costs with growth in loans and syndication
activity. The second quarter also included a $5.8 million write-down of a repossessed equity interest in a midstream energy entity. Corporate expense

Consumer Banking

Consumer Banking provides retail banking services through four primary distribution channels: traditional branches, the 24-hour ExpressBank call center,
Internet banking and mobile banking. Consumer Banking also conducts mortgage banking activities through offices located outside of our Consumer Banking
markets.

Consumer Banking contributed $1.2 million to consolidated net income for the second quarter of 2022, compared to a prior quarter net loss of $7.3 million.
Changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedges, increased pre-tax net income for the second quarter of 2022 by $1.9 million
compared to an $8.4 million decrease in pre-tax net income in the first quarter of 2022.

Net interest revenue from Consumer Banking activities increased $6.6 million or 24 percent compared to the first quarter of 2022, mainly due to an increase in
the spread on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit. Average consumer deposits grew $130 million or 1 percent over the first quarter of 2022.

Operating revenue decreased $3.9 million or 11 percent compared to the prior quarter. Mortgage production volume decreased $102 million to $306 million
and production revenue as a percentage of production volumes decreased 140 basis points resulting in a $5.3 million decrease in mortgage banking revenues.
Operating expense increased $3.9 million or 8 percent. Business promotion expense increased $1.8 million and mortgage banking costs increased $1.6 million
related to accruals for default servicing and loss mitigation costs. Corporate expense allocations decreased $2.0 million or 16 percent compared to the first
quarter of 2022.

Wealth Management

Wealth Management contributed $27.3 million to consolidated net income in the second quarter of 2022 compared to a net loss of $4.5 million in the first
quarter of 2022. Trading activity has returned to more normal levels following disruption in the fixed income markets related to uncertainty around rising
inflation and interest rates that occurred in the first quarter of 2022.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item.

Combined net interest revenue and fee revenue increased $43.7 million or 54 percent. Total revenue from trading activities increased $47.4 million compared to
the first quarter of 2022. Market disruptions during the first quarter of 2022 reduced demand for low-coupon, fixed-rate U.S. government agency residential
mortgage-backed securities. These securities were fully sold during the second quarter. Growth in money market fund revenue, seasonal tax preparation fees
and a reduction in fee waivers combined to increase fiduciary and asset management revenue $6.6 million. This increase was partially offset by a $3.2 million
reduction in trust business line fees related to decreased asset under management billable fees, consistent with market driven declines in equities, which
account for a third of the assets under management or administration. Operating expense increased $1.8 million or 2 percent, primarily due to increased
volume-driven incentive compensation costs and a full quarter's impact of annual merit increases.

Average outstanding loans attributed to the Wealth Management segment increased $39 million or 2 percent. Average Wealth Management deposits decreased
$1.1 billion or 12 percent to $8.5 billion as customers redeployed deposits into higher yielding alternatives.

Financial Condition

Securities

We maintain a securities portfolio to enhance profitability, manage interest rate risk, provide liquidity and comply with regulatory requirements. Securities are
classified as trading, held for investment, or available for sale. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the composition of the securities
portfolio as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

We hold an inventory of trading securities in support of sales to a variety of customers, including banks, corporations, insurance companies, money managers
and others. Trading securities decreased $2.0 billion to $2.9 billion during the second quarter of 2022 as we reduced our inventory of low-coupon mortgage-
backed securities and repositioned the trading portfolio in response to rising mortgage interest rates. As discussed in the Market Risk section of this report,
trading activities involve risk of loss from adverse price movement. We mitigate this risk within board-approved limits through the use of derivative contracts,
short-sales and other techniques.

At June 30, 2022, the carrying value of investment (held-to-maturity) securities was $2.6 billion, including a $717 thousand allowance for expected credit
losses compared to $184 million at March 31, 2022 with a $633 thousand allowance for expected credit losses. The fair value of investment securities was $2.6
billion at June 30, 2022 and $191 million at March 31, 2022. Investment securities consist primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S.
government agencies, intermediate and long-term, fixed rate Oklahoma and Texas municipal bonds, and taxable Texas school construction bonds. During the
second quarter of 2022, the Company transferred certain U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities from the available for sale portfolio to the
investment securities portfolio to limit the effect of future rate increases on the tangible common equity ratio. No gains or losses were recognized in the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings at the time of the transfer. At the time of transfer, the fair value totaled $2.4 billion, amortized cost totaled $2.7 billion and
the pretax unrealized loss totaled $268 million. Transfers of debt securities into the investment securities portfolio are made at fair value at the date of transfer.
The unrealized holding gain or loss at the date of transfer is retained in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and in the carrying value of the investment
securities portfolio. Such amounts are amortized over the estimated remaining life of the security as an adjustment to yield, offsetting the related amortization
of the premium or accretion of the discount on the transferred securities.

Available for sale securities, which may be sold prior to maturity, are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses, net of deferred taxes, are recorded as
accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. The amortized cost of available for sale securities totaled $10.7 billion at June 30, 2022, a
$2.8 billion decrease compared to March 31, 2022, primarily due to the transfer of securities from the available for sale portfolio to the investment securities
portfolio discussed above. At June 30, 2022, the available for sale securities portfolio consisted primarily of U.S. government agency residential mortgage-
backed securities and U.S. government agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Both residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities have
credit risk from delinquency or default of the underlying loans. We mitigate this risk by primarily investing in securities issued by U.S. government
agencies. Principal and interest payments on the underlying loans are fully guaranteed. Commercial mortgage-backed securities have prepayment penalties
similar to commercial loans.

A primary risk of holding residential mortgage-backed securities comes from extension during periods of rising interest rates or prepayment during periods of
falling interest rates. We evaluate this risk through extensive modeling of risk both before making an investment and throughout the life of the security. Our
best estimate of the duration of the combined residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio held in investment and available for sale securities at June 30,
2022 is 3.4 years. Management estimates the duration extends to 3.8 years assuming an immediate 200 basis point upward shock. The estimated duration
contracts to 3.0 years assuming a 100 basis point decline in the current low rate environment. Management also regularly monitors the impact of interest rate
risk on the available for sale securities portfolio on our tangible equity ratio under various shock scenarios. Throughout the second quarter of 2022, this
exposure was reported and monitored by management, and the portfolio's actual performance remained within expectations.

Bank-Owned Life Insurance

We have approximately $410 million of bank-owned life insurance at June 30, 2022. This investment is expected to provide a long-term source of earnings to
support existing employee benefit programs. Approximately $316 million is held in separate accounts. Our separate account holdings are invested in diversified
portfolios of investment-grade fixed income securities and cash equivalents, including U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, residential mortgage-backed
securities, corporate debt, asset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities. The portfolios are managed by unaffiliated professional managers within
parameters established in the portfolio’s investment guidelines. The cash surrender value of certain life insurance policies is further supported by a stable value
wrap, which protects against changes in the fair value of the investments. As of June 30, 2022, the fair value of investments held in separate accounts covered
by the stable value wrap was approximately $291 million. As the underlying fair value of the investments held in separate accounts at June 30, 2022 was below
the net book value of the investments, $23 million of cash surrender value was supported by the stable value wrap. Future rate increases may cause impairment
as the fair value deterioration could exceed the stable value wrap protection. The stable value wrap is provided by a domestic financial institution. The
remaining cash surrender value of $94 million primarily represents the cash surrender value of policies held in general accounts and other amounts due from
various insurance companies.

Loans

The aggregate loan portfolio before allowance for loan losses totaled $21.3 billion at June 30, 2022, a $617 million increase over March 31, 2022. Core loans,
which exclude paycheck protection program loans, grew by $711 million, primarily due to growth in commercial loans. Unfunded loan commitments also grew
by $979 million during the second quarter.

Commercial loans represent loans for working capital, facilities acquisition or expansion, purchases of equipment and other needs of commercial customers
primarily located within our geographical footprint. These loans are underwritten individually and represent ongoing relationships based on a thorough
knowledge of the customer, the customer’s industry and market. While commercial loans are generally secured by the customer’s assets including real property,
inventory, accounts receivable, operating equipment, interests in mineral rights and other property and may also include personal guarantees of the owners and
related parties, the primary source of repayment of the loans is the ongoing cash flow from operations of the customer’s business. In addition, revolving lines of
credit are generally governed by a borrowing base. Inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life
of the loan for compliance with commercial lending policies.

Commercial loans totaled $13.6 billion or 64 percent of the loan portfolio at June 30, 2022, a $696 million increase over March 31, 2022, growing in all
commercial loan categories.

- 20 -

 
 
Approximately 75 percent of loans in this segment are located within our geographic footprint, based on collateral location. Loans for which the collateral
location is less relevant, such as unsecured loans and reserve-based energy loans are categorized by the borrower's primary operating location. The largest
concentration of loans in this segment outside of our footprint is California, totaling 5 percent of the segment.

Supporting the energy industry with loans to producers and other energy-related entities has been a hallmark of the Company since its founding and represents
a large portion of our commercial loan portfolio. In addition, energy production and related industries have a significant impact on the economy in our primary
markets. Loans collateralized by oil and gas properties are subject to a semi-annual engineering review by our internal staff of petroleum engineers. This
review is used as the basis for developing the expected cash flows supporting the loan amount. The projected cash flows are discounted according to risk
characteristics of the underlying oil and gas properties. Loans are evaluated to demonstrate with reasonable certainty that crude oil, natural gas and natural gas
liquids can be recovered from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at current pricing levels and with existing
conventional equipment and operating methods and costs. As part of our evaluation of credit quality, we analyze rigorous stress tests over a range of
commodity prices and take proactive steps to mitigate risk when appropriate.

Outstanding energy loans totaled $3.4 billion or 16 percent of total loans at June 30, 2022, a $195 million increase over March 31, 2022. Approximately $2.6
billion of energy loans were to oil and gas producers, a $188 million increase over March 31, 2022. The majority of this portfolio is first lien, senior secured,
reserve-based lending, which we believe is the lowest risk form of energy lending. Approximately 72 percent of the committed production loans are secured by
properties primarily producing oil and 28 percent of the committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing natural gas.

Loans to midstream oil and gas companies totaled $640 million at June 30, 2022, a $10 million increase compared to March 31, 2022. Loans to borrowers that
provide services to the energy industry totaled $134 million at June 30, 2022, an increase of $14 million. Loans to other energy borrowers, including those
engaged in wholesale or retail energy sales, totaled $8.2 million, a decrease of $15 million compared to the prior quarter.

Unfunded energy loan commitments were $3.4 billion at June 30, 2022, growing $342 million over March 31, 2022.

The healthcare sector of the loan portfolio totaled $3.7 billion or 17 percent of total loans. Healthcare loans increased $255 million over March 31, 2022,
primarily due to growth in loans to senior housing facilities. This was partially offset by a decline in balances to other medical practices compared to the prior
quarter. Healthcare sector loans consist primarily of loans for the development and operation of senior housing and care facilities, including independent living,
assisted living and skilled nursing. Generally we loan to borrowers with a portfolio of multiple facilities that serves to help diversify risks specific to a single
facility.
The services sector of the loan portfolio totaled $3.4 billion or 16 percent of total loans, a $70 million increase compared to the prior quarter. Service sector
loans consist of a large number of loans to a variety of businesses, including Native American tribal and state and local governments, Native American tribal
casino operations, foundations and not-for-profit organizations, educational services and specialty trade contractors. Approximately $1.6 billion of the services
category is made up of loans with individual balances of less than $10 million. Services sector loans are generally secured by the assets of the borrower with
repayment coming from the cash flows of ongoing operations of the customer’s business. 

General business loans totaled $3.1 billion or 14 percent of total loans, an increase of $175 million over the prior quarter. General business loans consist of $1.6
billion of wholesale/retail loans and $1.5 billion of loans from other commercial industries.

We participate in shared national credits when appropriate to obtain or maintain business relationships with local customers. Shared national credits are defined
by banking regulators as credits of $100 million or more and with three or more non-affiliated banks as participants. At June 30, 2022, the outstanding principal
balance of these loans totaled $4.6 billion, including $2.0 billion of energy loans. Substantially all of these loans are to borrowers with local market
relationships. We serve as the agent lender in approximately 22 percent of our shared national credits, based on dollars committed. We hold shared national
credits to the same standard of analysis and perform the same level of review as internally originated credits. Our lending policies generally avoid loans in
which we do not have the opportunity to maintain or achieve other business relationships with the customer. In addition to management’s quarterly assessment
of credit risk, banking regulators annually review a sample of shared national credits for proper risk grading.

Commercial Real Estate

Commercial real estate represents loans for the construction of buildings or other improvements to real estate and property held by borrowers for investment
purposes generally within our geographical footprint. We require collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, demonstrated cash flows in excess of expected
debt service requirements, equity investment in the project and a portion of the project already sold, leased or permanent financing already secured. The
expected cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates,
vacancy rates and rental rates. As with commercial loans, inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the
life of the loan for compliance with applicable lending policies.

The outstanding balance of commercial real estate loans increased $5.2 million over March 31, 2022 to $4.1 billion or 19 percent of total loans at June 30,
2022. Loans secured by industrial facilities grew by $42 million to $954 million. Multifamily residential loans increased $11 million to $879 million at June 30,
2022. Loans secured by retail facilities decreased $30 million to $637 million and loans secured by other commercial real estate properties decreased $11
million to $425 million.

Approximately 69 percent of loans in this segment are in our geographic footprint based on collateral location. The largest concentration of loans in this
segment outside our footprint is Utah, totaling 10 percent of the segment. All other states represent less than 5 percent individually.

Paycheck Protection Program

We actively participated in programs initiated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"), including the Small Business
Administration's ("SBA") Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") that began on April 3, 2020. PPP provided fully forgivable loans when utilized for qualified
expenditures, including to help small businesses maintain payrolls during the COVID-19 pandemic. The remaining loans in this portfolio generally have a
contractual term of five years, though most are expected to be forgiven prior to maturity after completion of a compliance period. Loans are guaranteed and
amounts forgiven will be reimbursed to the Company by the SBA. The loans carry a fixed interest rate of 1 percent. Interest plus loan fees, which vary
depending on loan size, are accrued over the contractual life of the loan. Remaining unaccreted origination fees were not significant at June 30, 2022.

Loans to Individuals

Loans to individuals include residential mortgage and personal loans. Residential mortgage loans provide funds for our customers to purchase or refinance their
primary residence or to borrow against the equity in their home. These loans are secured by a first or second mortgage on the customer's primary residence.
These loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and are fully documented. Loans may be individually
underwritten or credit scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant credit characteristics including credit history,
residential and employment stability.

In general, we sell the majority of our conforming fixed-rate loan originations in the secondary market and retain the majority of our non-conforming and
adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Our mortgage loan portfolio does not include payment option adjustable-rate mortgage loans or adjustable-rate mortgage loans
with initial rates that are below market. Home equity loans are primarily first-lien and fully amortizing.

Residential mortgage, which includes home equity loans, and personal loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative
and are fully documented. Loans may be individually underwritten or credit scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on
significant credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment stability.

Personal loans consist primarily of loans to Wealth Management clients secured by the cash surrender value of insurance policies and marketable securities. It
also includes direct loans secured by and for the purchase of automobiles, recreational and marine equipment as well as unsecured loans.

Approximately 91 percent of the loans in this segment are secured by collateral located within our geographical footprint. Loans for which the collateral
location is less relevant, such as unsecured loans are categorized by the borrower’s primary operating location.

- 22 -

Residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies have limited credit exposure because of the agency guarantee. This amount includes
residential mortgage loans previously sold into GNMA mortgage pools that the Company may repurchase when certain defined delinquency criteria are met.
Because of this repurchase right, the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans and must include them on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. After peaking in the second quarter of 2021, these loans are migrating toward pre-COVID levels through payoffs or sales.

The Company secondarily evaluates loan portfolio performance based on the primary geographical market managing the loan. Loans attributed to a
geographical market may not represent the location of the borrower or the collateral. All permanent mortgage loans serviced by our mortgage banking unit and
held for investment by the Company are centrally managed by the Oklahoma market.

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments

We enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business as shown in Table 14. Loan commitments may be unconditional
obligations to provide financing or conditional obligations that depend on the borrower’s financial condition, collateral value or other factors. Standby letters of
credit are unconditional commitments to guarantee the performance of our customer to a third party. Since some of these commitments are expected to expire
before being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

We have off-balance sheet commitments related to certain residential mortgage loans sold into mortgage-backed securities as part of our mortgage banking
activities. We retain off-balance sheet credit risk related to losses in excess of amounts guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA").

We also have off-balance sheet credit risk related to certain residential mortgage loans primarily originated under community development loan programs that
were sold to a U.S. government agency with full recourse prior to 2007. We are obligated to repurchase these loans for the life of these loans in the event of
foreclosure for the unpaid principal and interest at the time of foreclosure. The majority of our conforming fixed rate loan originations are sold in the secondary
market and we only retain repurchase obligations under standard underwriting representations and warranties.

We offer programs that permit our customers to hedge various risks, including fluctuations in energy, cattle and other agricultural product prices, interest rates
and foreign exchange rates. Each of these programs work essentially the same way. Derivative contracts are executed between the customers and the
Company. Offsetting contracts are executed between the Company and selected counterparties to minimize market risk due to changes in commodity prices,
interest rates or foreign exchange rates. The counterparty contracts are identical to the customer contracts, except for a fixed pricing spread or a fee paid to us
as compensation for administrative costs, credit risk and profit.

The customer derivative programs create credit risk for potential amounts due to the Company from our customers and from the counterparties. Customer
credit risk is monitored through existing credit policies and procedures. The effects of changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates are
evaluated across a range of possible scenarios to determine the maximum exposure we are willing to have individually to any customer. Customers may also be
required to provide cash margin or other collateral in conjunction with our credit agreements to further limit our credit risk.

Counterparty credit risk is evaluated through existing policies and procedures. This evaluation considers the total relationship between BOK Financial and each
of the counterparties. Individual limits are established by management, approved by Credit Administration and reviewed by the Asset/Liability
Committee. Margin collateral is required if the exposure between the Company and any counterparty exceeds established limits. Based on declines in the
counterparties’ credit ratings, these limits may be reduced and additional margin collateral may be required.

A deterioration of the credit standing of one or more of the customers or counterparties to these contracts may result in BOK Financial recognizing a loss as the
fair value of the affected contracts may no longer move in tandem with the offsetting contracts. This occurs if the credit standing of the customer or
counterparty deteriorated such that either the fair value of underlying collateral no longer supported the contract or the customer or the counterparty’s ability to
provide margin collateral was impaired. Credit losses on customer derivatives reduce brokerage and trading revenue in the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings.

- 25 -

 
 
Derivative contracts are carried at fair value. At June 30, 2022, the net fair values of derivative contracts, before consideration of cash margin, reported as
assets under these programs totaled $2.0 billion compared to $2.4 billion at March 31, 2022. At June 30, 2022, the net fair value of our derivative contracts
included $1.9 billion for energy contracts, $96 million for interest rate swaps and $70 million for foreign exchange contracts. The aggregate net fair value of
derivative contracts, before consideration of cash margin, held under these programs reported as liabilities totaled $2.0 billion at June 30, 2022 and $2.4 billion
at March 31, 2022.

At June 30, 2022, total derivative assets were reduced by $75 million of cash collateral received from counterparties and total derivative liabilities were
reduced by $1.9 billion of cash collateral paid to counterparties related to instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement.
Derivative contracts executed with customers may be secured by non-cash collateral in conjunction with a credit agreement with that customer, such as proven
producing oil and gas properties. Access to this collateral in event of default is reasonably assured.

A table showing the notional and fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on both a gross and net basis is presented in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The fair value of derivative contracts reported as assets under these programs, net of cash margin held by the Company, by category of debtor at June 30, 2022
follows in Table 15.

At June 30, 2022, our largest derivative exposure was to an energy customer for $94 million.

Our customer derivative program also introduces liquidity and capital risk. We are required to provide cash margin to certain counterparties when the net
negative fair value of the contracts exceeds established limits. Also, changes in commodity prices affect the amount of regulatory capital we are required to
hold as support for the fair value of our derivative assets. These risks are modeled as part of the management of these programs. Based on current prices, a
decrease in market prices equivalent to $91.47 per barrel of oil would decrease the fair value of derivative assets by $510 million, with lending customers
comprising the bulk of the assets. An increase in prices equivalent to $120.05 per barrel of oil would increase the fair value of derivative assets by $673 million
as asset values rise faster than margin paid. Liquidity requirements of this program may also be affected by our credit rating. At June 30, 2022, a decrease in
our credit rating to below investment grade would increase our obligation to post cash margin on existing contracts by approximately $10 million. The fair
value of our to-be-announced residential mortgage-backed securities and interest rate swap derivative contracts is affected by changes in interest rates. Based
on our assessment as of June 30, 2022, changes in interest rates would not materially impact regulatory capital or liquidity needed to support this portion of our
customer derivative program.

Allowance for Loan Losses and Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk from Unfunded Loan Commitments

Expected credit losses on assets carried at amortized cost are recognized over their expected lives based on models that measure the probability of default and
loss given default over a 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period. Models incorporate base case, downside and upside macroeconomic variables
such as real gross domestic product ("GDP") growth, civilian unemployment rate and West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") oil prices on a probability weighted
basis. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of methodology of allowance for loan losses.

No provision for credit losses was necessary for the second quarter of 2022. An increase in allowance related to our lending activities from the strong loan
growth during the quarter and changes in our reasonable and supportable forecast, primarily related to the economic outlook from the Federal Reserve's actions
to control inflation, were offset by the impact of a sustained trend of improving credit quality metrics.

- 28 -

The probability weightings of our base case reasonable and supportable forecast decreased and our downside reasonable and supportable forecast increased in
the second quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2022 as the level of uncertainty in the current economic outlook increased. In addition, the key
economic factors were generally less favorable to economic growth across all scenarios. These changes resulted in a $15.8 million increase in the provision for
credit losses. This increase was largely offset by a decrease in expected losses on commercial services and wholesale / retail loans.

The federal funds rate is increased at
Federal Reserve Open Market ("FOMC")
meetings through June 2023, which results
in a target range of 3.50 percent to 3.75
percent.

Labor force participants continue to re-enter
the job market to meet the record number of
job openings. Inflation pressures cause
modest declines in real household income
compared to pre-pandemic levels, but is
offset by a drawdown in savings. This
results in below-trend GDP growth.

Additional surges in commodity prices
exacerbated by supply chain dislocations
create higher levels of inflation forcing the
Federal Reserve to adopt a more aggressive
monetary policy to combat the inflationary
environment. This results in a target range
of 4.50 percent to 4.75 percent by June
2023. This pushes the United States into a
recession, with a contraction in economic
activity and a sharp increase in the
unemployment rate.

The federal funds rate is increased at
FOMC meetings through June 2023, which
results in a target range of 3.00 percent to
3.25 percent.

Labor force participants continue to re-enter
the job market to meet the record number of
job openings. The increase in employment
helps maintain household income above its
pre-pandemic trend. This coupled with the
drawdown in savings, supports consumer
spending and produces GDP growth
consistent with pre-pandemic levels.

– GDP is forecasted to grow by 1.4
percent over the next 12 months.

– Civilian unemployment rate of 3.7
percent in the third quarter of 2022
increases to 4.0 percent by the
second quarter of 2023.

– WTI oil prices are projected to
generally follow the NYMEX
forward curve that existed at the
end of June 2022 and are expected
to average $98.15 per barrel over
the next 12 months.

– GDP is forecasted to contract 1.8
percent over the next twelve
months.

– Civilian unemployment rate of 4.2
percent in the third quarter of 2022
increases to 6.9 percent in the
second quarter of 2023.

– WTI oil prices are projected to

average $105.36 over the next 12
months, with a peak of $130.37 in
the fourth quarter of 2022 and
falling 39% over the following two
quarters.

– GDP is forecasted to grow by 2.4
percent over the next 12 months.

– Civilian unemployment rate of 3.5
percent in the third quarter of 2022
increases to 3.6 percent by the
second quarter of 2023.

– WTI oil prices are projected to

average $90.27 per barrel over the
next 12 months.

The sensitivity to management's economic scenario weighting may be quantified by comparing the results of weighting each
economic scenario at 100%. For example, compared to a 100% Base Case scenario, a 100% Downside case would result in an
additional $118 million in quantitative reserve at June 30, 2022. Such sensitivity calculations do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes
in the related allowance.

Growth in loan balances resulted in a $5.3 million increase in allowance, offset by a $1.9 million decrease related to improved risk grading, a $3.0 million
decrease related to changes in payment characteristics of the portfolio and net recoveries of $799 thousand during the second quarter of 2022. Improved risk
grading during the quarter was primarily related to energy, services, general business and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by slightly worse risk
grades in the healthcare portfolio. A summary of outstanding loan balances by risk grade is included in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-
pass grade loans include other loans especially mentioned, defined by regulatory guidelines as loans that are currently performing in compliance with original
terms but may have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention, accruing substandard loans, and nonaccruing loans. Non-pass grade loans
totaled $323 million at June 30, 2022, a $66 million decrease compared to March 31, 2022. Non-pass graded loans were primarily composed of $81 million or
2 percent of services loans, $58 million or 2 percent of energy loans, $58 million or 2 percent of healthcare loans, $50 million or 1 percent of loans to
individuals, $43 million or 1 percent of general business loans and $32 million or 1 percent of commercial real estate loans.

At June 30, 2022, the allowance for loan losses totaled $241 million or 1.13 percent of outstanding loans. Excluding residential mortgage loans guaranteed by
U.S. government agencies, the allowance for loan losses was 251 percent of nonaccruing loans. The combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-
balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $283 million or 1.33 percent of outstanding loans and 295 percent of nonaccruing loans at June
30, 2022.

No provision for credit losses was necessary for the first quarter of 2022. At March 31, 2022, the allowance for loan losses was $246 million or 1.19 percent of
outstanding loans. Excluding residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, the allowance for loan losses was 230 percent of
nonaccruing loans. The combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $283 million or
1.37 percent of outstanding loans and 264 percent of nonaccruing loans.

Net Loans Charged Off

Net recoveries of commercial loans were $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2022. Net commercial real estate loan charge-offs were $62 thousand and net
charge-offs of loans to individuals were $721 thousand. Net charge-offs of loans to individuals include deposit account overdraft losses.

Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk Associated with Mortgage Banking Activities

The accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk associated with mortgage banking activities includes consideration of credit risk related to certain residential
mortgage loans sold into mortgage-backed securities in excess of amounts guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs ("VA") and mortgage loans
originated under community development loan programs that were sold to a U.S. government agency with full recourse.

We use publicly available long-term national data to estimate total loss given default for our off-balance sheet credit risk related to losses in excess of amounts
guaranteed by the VA. This result is combined with probability of default output from our mortgage servicing rights model to estimate total expected loss.
Then, we estimate the VA's guarantee percentage to determine our portion of the credit risk. Qualitative adjustment may be used, if necessary.

Allowance for Credit Losses Related to Held-to-Maturity (Investment) Securities

The expected credit losses principles apply to all financial assets measured at cost, including our held-to-maturity (investment) debt securities portfolio. Our
investment portfolio includes municipal and other tax-exempt securities and other debt securities. Expected credit losses for these assets is based on probability
of default and loss given default assumptions that align with similarly graded loans. Qualitative adjustment may be used, if necessary.

Nonperforming Assets

As more fully described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, loans are generally classified as nonaccruing when it becomes probable that we
will not collect the full contractual principal and interest. Accruing renegotiated loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies represent residential mortgage
loans that have been modified in troubled debt restructurings. Interest continues to accrue based on the modified terms of the loan and loans may be sold once
they become eligible according to U.S. government agency guidelines. Real estate and other repossessed assets are assets acquired in partial or total forgiveness
of loans. The assets are carried at the lower of cost as determined by fair value at the date of foreclosure or current fair value, less estimated selling costs. A
summary of nonperforming assets follows in Table 17:

Excluding assets guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, nonperforming assets decreased $13 million from March 31, 2022, primarily due to a $5.1 million
decrease in nonaccruing commercial real estate loans and a $4.1 million decrease in nonaccruing energy loans. Newly identified nonaccruing loans totaled $4.4
million, offset by $8.4 million of payments, $4.0 million in foreclosures and $1.4 million of charge-offs. The Company generally retains nonperforming assets
to maximize potential recovery, which may cause future nonperforming assets to decrease more slowly.

We foreclose on loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies in accordance with agency guidelines. Generally these loans are not eligible for modification
programs or have failed to comply with modified loan terms. Principal is guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. government, subject to limitations and credit risk
is limited. At foreclosure, these amounts are transferred to claims receivable accounts. These properties will be conveyed to the agencies once applicable
criteria have been met.

Real Estate and Other Repossessed Assets

Real estate and other repossessed assets totaled $22 million at June 30, 2022, composed primarily of $15 million of developed commercial real estate. Real
estate and other repossessed assets decreased $2.3 million compared to March 31, 2022.

Liquidity and Capital

Based on the average balances for the second quarter of 2022, approximately 82 percent of our funding was provided by deposit accounts, 5 percent from
borrowed funds, less than 1 percent from long-term subordinated debt and 10 percent from equity. Our funding sources, which primarily include deposits and
borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks and other banks, provide adequate liquidity to meet our operating needs.

Subsidiary Bank

Deposits and borrowed funds are the primary sources of liquidity for BOKF, NA, the wholly owned subsidiary bank of BOK Financial. We compete for retail
and commercial deposits by offering a broad range of products and services and focusing on customer convenience. Retail deposit growth is supported through
personal and small business checking, online bill paying services, mobile banking services, an extensive network of branch locations and ATMs and our
ExpressBank call center. Commercial deposit growth is supported by offering treasury management and lockbox services. We also acquire brokered deposits
when the cost of funds is advantageous to other funding sources.

Average deposits for the second quarter of 2022 totaled $38.6 billion, a $1.8 billion decrease compared to the first quarter of 2022. Deposit balances are
beginning to reduce as customers start to deploy cash resources into higher yielding alternatives and increase spending levels following the height of the
pandemic. Interest-bearing transaction account balances decreased $1.7 billion. Demand deposits grew by $140 million and savings account balances were up
$34 million. Certificate of deposit balances decreased $216 million.

Average Commercial Banking deposit balances decreased $661 million compared to the first quarter of 2022. Interest-bearing transaction account balances
decreased $731 million and time deposits decreased $223 million. Demand deposit balances were up $292 million. Commercial deposit balances have
decreased as short-term rates move higher, enhancing their investment alternatives.

Average Consumer Banking deposit balances increased $130 million over the prior quarter, largely due to annual income tax deadlines. Demand deposit
balances increased $68 million, interest-bearing transaction deposit balances increased $55 million and savings account balances increased $35 million.

Average Wealth Management deposits decreased $1.1 billion compared to the first quarter of 2022. A $925 million decrease in interest-bearing transaction
accounts and a $233 million decrease in demand deposit balances was partially offset by a $22 million increase in time deposit balances.

Average time deposits for the second quarter of 2022 included $57 million of brokered deposits, a $9.3 million increase compared to the first quarter of 2022.
Average interest-bearing transaction accounts for the second quarter included $2.0 billion of brokered deposits, a $67 million decrease compared to the first
quarter of 2022.

In addition to deposits, liquidity is provided primarily by federal funds purchased, securities repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank
borrowings. Federal funds purchased consist primarily of unsecured, overnight funds acquired from other financial institutions. Funds are primarily purchased
from bankers’ banks and Federal Home Loan banks from across the country. The Company has no wholesale federal funds purchased at June 30, 2022.
Securities repurchase agreements generally mature within 90 days and are secured by certain available for sale and trading securities. Federal Home Loan Bank
borrowings are generally short-term and are secured by a blanket pledge of eligible collateral (generally unencumbered U.S. Treasury and agency mortgage-
backed securities, 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, multifamily and other qualifying commercial real estate loans). Amounts borrowed from the Federal
Home Loan Bank of Topeka averaged $1.3 billion during the quarter, compared to $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2022.

At June 30, 2022, the estimated unused credit available to BOKF, NA from collateralized sources was approximately $15 billion.

A summary of other borrowings for BOK Financial on a consolidated basis follows in Table 21.

BOKF, NA also has a liability related to the repurchase of certain delinquent residential mortgage loans previously sold in GNMA mortgage pools. Interest is
payable monthly at rates contractually due to investors if delinquent loans are not repurchased from the GNMA mortgage pools.

Parent Company

At June 30, 2022, cash and interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents held by the parent company totaled $162 million. The primary sources of liquidity for
BOK Financial are cash on hand and dividends from BOKF, NA. Dividends from the bank are limited by various banking regulations to net profits, as defined,
for the year plus retained profits for the two preceding years. Dividends are further restricted by minimum capital requirements. At June 30, 2022, based upon
the most restrictive limitations as well as management's internal capital policy, BOKF, NA could declare up to $206 million of dividends. Dividend constraints
may be alleviated through increases in retained earnings, capital issuances or changes in risk weighted assets. Future losses or increases in required regulatory
capital at the bank could affect its ability to pay dividends to the parent company.

Our equity capital at June 30, 2022 was $4.7 billion, a $112 million decrease compared to March 31, 2022. Net income less cash dividends paid increased
equity $97 million during the second quarter of 2022. Changes in interest rates resulted in a $185 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income
compared to March 31, 2022. We also repurchased $24 million of common stock during the second quarter of 2022. Capital is managed to maximize long-term
value to the shareholders. Factors considered in managing capital include projections of future earnings including expected benefits from lower federal income
tax rates, asset growth and acquisition strategies, and regulatory and debt covenant requirements. Capital management may include subordinated debt or
perpetual preferred stock issuance, share repurchase and stock and cash dividends.

On April 30, 2019, the board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to five million common shares, subject to market conditions, securities law
and other regulatory compliance limitations. As of June 30, 2022, 4,103,431 shares have been repurchased under this authorization. The Company repurchased
294,084 shares of common stock at an average price of $82.98 a share in the second quarter of 2022. We view share buybacks opportunistically, but within the
context of maintaining our strong capital position.

BOK Financial and BOKF, NA are subject to various capital requirements administered by federal agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material impact on operations. These capital
requirements include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items. The capital standards are also subject to qualitative judgments by
the regulators.

A summary of minimum capital requirements, including capital conservation buffer follows in Table 22. A bank which falls below these levels, including the
capital conservation buffer, would be subject to regulatory restrictions on capital distributions (including but not limited to dividends and share repurchases)
and executive bonus payments.

In March 2020, in response to the impact on the financial markets by the COVID-19 pandemic, the banking agencies issued an interim final rule permitting
banking organizations that implement CECL the option to delay for two years an estimate of the CECL methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by
a three-year transition period. The estimate includes the implementation date adjustment as of January 1, 2020 plus an estimate of the impact of the change for
a two year period following implementation of CECL. We elected to delay the regulatory capital impact of the transition in accordance with the interim final
rule. Deferral of the impact of CECL added 10 basis points to the Company's Common equity Tier 1 capital at June 30, 2022.

The capital ratios for BOK Financial on a consolidated basis are presented in Table 22.

Capital resources of financial institutions are also regularly measured by the tangible common shareholders’ equity ratio. Tangible common shareholders’
equity is shareholders’ equity as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) less intangible assets and
equity which does not benefit common shareholders. Equity that does not benefit common shareholders includes preferred equity. This non-GAAP measure is a
valuable indicator of a financial institution’s capital strength since it eliminates intangible assets from shareholders’ equity and retains the effect of unrealized
losses on securities and other components of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity.

Table 23 provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures with financial measures defined by GAAP.

Pre-provision net revenue is a measure of revenue less expenses, and is calculated before provision for credit losses and income tax expense. This financial
measure is frequently used by investors and analysts to enable them to assess a company's ability to generate earnings to cover credit losses through a credit
cycle. It also provides an additional basis for comparing the results of operations between periods by isolating the impact of the provision for credit losses,
which can vary significantly between periods.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company’s significant off-balance sheet commitments.
