There are no material changes from the risk factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, except as described below. 

Recent events impacting the financial services industry could adversely affect BOK Financial ' s business. 

Recent events affecting the financial services industry have generated significant market volatility among publicly traded bank holding companies with particular focus on regional banks. These events occurred following a period of rapidly rising interest rates, which resulted in unrealized losses in longer duration securities and loans held by banks as well as more competition for bank deposits. These recent events have, and may continue to, adversely impact the market price and volatility of the Company&#8217;s stock. Potentially adverse changes to laws or regulations governing banks and bank holding companies may occur, including but not limited to, increased regulatory scrutiny in the course of routine examinations or otherwise and new regulations directed towards banks of similar size, which could increase the costs of doing business. As a result of recent bank failures the FDIC proposed a special assessment to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund. If finalized, the special assessment will increase FDIC insurance premiums above the recently increased levels which will result in higher costs.
