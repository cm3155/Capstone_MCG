Management&#8217;s Assessment of Operations and Financial Condition 

Overview 

The following discussion is management&#8217;s analysis to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the financial condition and results of operations of BOK Financial Corporation ("BOK Financial" or "the Company"). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes and selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report. 

The U.S. economy completed its 11th year of expansion in 2019. The unemployment rate dropped to historic lows of 3.5% during the year. GDP grew 2.2% and is expected to remain close to 2% in 2020. Inflation also remained low, below 2% for 2019 and is expected to remain close to 2% in 2020. The Federal Reserve decreased the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points three times during the second half of 2019. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note finished the year yielding 1.92% versus 2.69% at December 31, 2018. 

Performance Summary 

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $500.8 million or $7.03 per diluted share compared with net income of $445.6 million or $6.63 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018 . 

We incurred $17.2 million of closing and integration costs in 2019 related to the acquisition of CoBiz Financial, Inc. ("CoBiz") on October 1, 2018, which resulted in an $0.18 per share reduction in 2019 . We incurred $16.6 million of closing and integrations costs in 2018, resulting in an $0.18 per share reduction. A fee earned through the sale of client assets of $15.4 million was recognized in Fiduciary and asset management fees in 2018 for a $0.17 per share addition. The fluctuation discussion in the highlights below exclude the impact of these items. 

Highlights of 2019 included:

Critical Accounting Policies &#38; Estimates 

The Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). The Company's accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management makes significant assumptions and estimates in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP that may be highly subjective, complex and subject to variability. Actual results could differ significantly from these assumptions and estimates. The following discussion addresses the most critical areas where these assumptions and estimates could affect the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. These critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the appropriate committees of the Board of Directors. 

Allowance for Loan Losses and Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk 

The appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk is assessed quarterly by management based on an ongoing evaluation of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio and probable estimated losses on unused commitments to provide financing. A consistent, well-documented methodology has been developed and is applied by an independent Credit Administration department to ensure consistency across the Company. The allowance for loan losses consists of specific allowances attributed to certain impaired loans that have not yet been charged down to amounts we expect to recover, general allowances for unimpaired loans that are based on estimated loss rates by loan class and nonspecific allowances for risks beyond factors specific to a particular portfolio segment or loan class. There were no material changes in the approach or techniques utilized in developing the allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk during 2019 . 

Loans are considered impaired when it is probable that we will not collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements, including loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring. Internally risk graded loans are evaluated individually for impairment. Substantially all commercial and commercial real estate loans and certain residential mortgage and personal loans are risk graded through a quarterly evaluation of the borrower's ability to repay. 

Specific allowances for impaired loans that have not yet been charged down to amounts we expect to recover are measured by an evaluation of estimated future cash flows discounted at the loan's initial effective interest rate or the fair value of collateral for certain collateral dependent loans. Collateral value of real property is generally based on third party appraisals that conform to Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, less estimated selling costs. Appraised values are on an &#8220;as-is&#8221; basis and generally are not adjusted by the Company. Updated appraisals are obtained at least annually or more frequently if market conditions indicate collateral values may have declined. Collateral value of mineral rights is determined by our internal staff of engineers based on projected cash flows under current market conditions. The value of other collateral is generally determined by our special assets staff based on liquidation cash flows under current market conditions. Collateral values and available cash resources that support impaired loans are evaluated quarterly. Historical statistics may be used as a practical way to estimate impairment in limited situations, such as when a collateral dependent loan is identified as impaired near the end of a reporting period until an updated appraisal of collateral value is received or a full assessment of future cash flows is completed. Estimates of future cash flows and collateral values require significant judgments and may be volatile. 

General allowances for unimpaired loans are based on estimated loss rates by loan class. The appropriate historical gross loss rate for each loan class is determined by the greater of the current loss rate based on the most recent twelve months or average gross loss rate over the long-term credit cycle. Recoveries are not directly considered in the estimation of historical loss rates. Recoveries generally do not follow predictable patterns and are not received until well-after the charge-off date as a result of protracted legal proceedings. For risk graded loans, historical loss rates are adjusted for changes in risk rating. For each loan class, the weighted average current risk grade is compared to the weighted average long-term risk grade. This comparison determines whether the risk in each loan class is increasing or decreasing. Historical loss rates are adjusted upward or downward in proportion to changes in weighted average risk grading. General allowances for unimpaired loans also consider inherent risks identified for a given loan class. Inherent risks include consideration of the loss rates that most appropriately represent the current credit cycle and other factors attributable to a specific loan class which have not yet been represented in the historical gross loss rates or risk grading. Examples of these factors include changes in commodity prices or engineering imprecision, which may affect the value of reserves that secure our energy loan portfolio, construction risk that may affect commercial real estate loans, changes in regulations and public policy that may disproportionately impact health care loans and changes in loan product types. 

Nonspecific allowances are maintained for risks beyond factors specific to a particular portfolio segment or loan class. These factors include trends in the economy in our primary lending areas, concentrations in loans with large balances and other relevant factors. 

Fair Value Measurement 

Certain assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair value is defined by applicable accounting guidance as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal markets for the given asset or liability at the measurement date based on market conditions at that date. An orderly transaction assumes exposure to the market for a customary period for marketing activities prior to the measurement date and not a forced liquidation or distressed sale. 

A hierarchy for fair value has been established that prioritizes the inputs of valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad categories: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), other observable inputs that can be observed either directly or indirectly (Level 2) and unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities (Level 3). Fair value may be recorded for certain assets and liabilities every reporting period on a recurring basis or under certain circumstances on a non-recurring basis. Fair value measurements of significant assets or liabilities that are based on unobservable inputs (Level 3) are considered Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Additional discussion of fair value measurement and disclosure is included in Notes 7 and 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

We have a significant investment in mortgage servicing rights. Our mortgage servicing rights are primarily retained from sales in the secondary market of residential mortgage loans we have originated or purchased from correspondent lenders. Occasionally, mortgage servicing rights may be purchased from other lenders. Both originated and purchased mortgage servicing rights are initially recognized at fair value. We carry all mortgage servicing rights at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as they occur. 

Mortgage servicing rights are not traded in active markets. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined by discounting the projected cash flows. Certain significant assumptions and estimates used in valuing mortgage servicing rights are based on current market sources including projected prepayment speeds, assumed servicing costs, earnings on escrow deposits, ancillary income and discount rates. Assumptions used to value our mortgage servicing rights are considered significant unobservable inputs and represent our best estimate of assumptions that market participants would use to value this asset. A separate third party model is used to estimate prepayment speeds based on interest rates, housing turnover rates, estimated loan curtailment, anticipated defaults and other relevant factors. The prepayment model is updated periodically for changes in market conditions and adjusted to better correlate with actual performance of our servicing portfolio. The discount rate is based on benchmark rates for mortgage loans plus a market spread expected by investors in servicing rights. Significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights are presented in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At least annually, we request estimates of fair value from outside sources to corroborate the results of the valuation model. 

The assumptions used in this model are primarily based on mortgage interest rates. Evaluation of the effect of a change in one assumption without considering the effect of that change on other assumptions is not meaningful. Considering all related assumptions, we expect a 50 basis point increase in primary mortgage interest rates to increase the fair value of our servicing rights by $30 million. We expect a $42 million decrease in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights from a 50 basis point decrease in primary mortgage interest rates. 

Valuation of Impaired Loans and Real Estate and Other Repossessed Assets 

The fair value of collateral for certain impaired loans and real estate and other repossessed assets is measured on a non-recurring basis. The fair value of real estate is generally based on unadjusted third-party appraisals derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Fair value measurements based on these appraisals are considered to be based on Level 2 inputs. Fair value measurements based on appraisals that are not based on observable inputs or that require significant adjustments by us or fair value measurements that are not based on third-party appraisals are considered to be based on Level 3 inputs. Significant unobservable inputs include listing prices for comparable assets, uncorroborated expert opinions or management's knowledge of the collateral or industry. 

The fair value of mineral rights is generally determined by our internal staff of engineers based on projected cash flows from proven oil and gas reserves under existing economic and operating conditions. Proven oil and gas reserves are estimated quantities that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs using existing prices and costs. Projected cash flows incorporate assumptions related to a number of factors including production, sales prices, operating expenses, severance, ad valorem taxes, capital costs and appropriate discount rate. Fair values determined through this process are considered to be based on Level 3 inputs. 

&#160; 

Income Taxes 

Determination of income tax expense and related assets and liabilities is complex and requires estimates and judgments when applying tax laws, rules, regulations and interpretations. It also requires judgments as to future earnings and the timing of future events. Accrued income taxes represent an estimate of net amounts due to or from taxing jurisdictions based upon these estimates, interpretations and judgments. 

Management evaluates the Company's current tax expense or benefit based upon estimates of taxable income, tax credits and statutory tax rates. Annually, we file tax returns with each jurisdiction where we conduct business and adjust recognized income tax expense or benefit to filed tax returns. 

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the values of assets and liabilities as recognized in the financial statements and their related tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the entire deferred tax asset may not be realized. 

We also recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when based upon all relevant evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that our position would prevail upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation, based upon the technical merits of the position. Unrecognized tax benefits, including estimated interest and penalties, are part of our current accrued income tax liability. Estimated penalties and interest are recognized in income tax expense. Income tax expense in future periods may decrease if an uncertain tax position is favorably resolved, generally upon completion of an examination by the taxing authorities, expiration of a statute of limitations, or changes in facts and circumstances. 

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Revenue and Net Interest Margin 

Net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities, loans and other interest-earning assets less interest paid for interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest revenue by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity. 

Tax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $1.1 billion for 2019 , up from $993.8 million for 2018 . Tax-equivalent net interest revenue increase d $130.7 million over the prior year. The acquisition of CoBiz in the fourth quarter of 2018 added $158.5 million to net interest revenue in 2019 and $43.1 million to net interest revenue in 2018. This includes $37.8 million of net purchase discount accretion for 2019 and $6.4 million for 2018. Net interest revenue decreased $13.7 million due to rates and increased $144.4 million from growth in earning assets. Table 2 shows the effects on net interest revenue due to changes in average balances and interest rates for the various types of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, see the Annual and Quarterly Financial Summary of consolidated daily average balances, yields and rates following the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Net interest margin was 3.11% for 2019 and 3.20% for 2018 . The tax-equivalent yield on earning assets was 4.27% for 2019 , up from 3.98% in 2018 . Short-term interest rate increases during the first half of the year resulting from four 25 basis point increases in the federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve during 2018 were partially offset by three 25 basis point decreases in the federal funds rate in the second half of 2019. Loan yields increase d 33 basis points to 5.13% . The available for sale securities portfolio yield increase d 23 basis points to 2.58% . The yield on interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents increase d 48 basis points to 2.28% . The yield on trading securities fell 29 basis points to 3.55% . 

Funding costs increase d 42 basis points over 2018 . The cost of interest-bearing deposits increase d 39 basis points. The cost of other short-term borrowings increase d 35 basis points. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 45 basis points for 2019 , up from 41 basis points for 2018 . 

Average earning assets for 2019 increase d $5.4 billion or 18% over 2018 , largely due to acquired loans combined with the expansion of the available for sale securities portfolio. Average loans, net of allowance for loan losses, increase d $3.4 billion . The average balance of available for sale securities, which consists largely of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, increase d $1.8 billion . We purchase securities to supplement earnings and to manage interest rate risk. We have increased the size of our bond portfolio during the second half of 2019 in order to reduce our exposure to falling short-term interest rates. Fair value option securities, which we hold as an economic hedge against changes in the fair value or mortgage servicing rights, increase d $682 million . Trading securities balances increase d $242 million . Average interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents decrease d $704 million . 

Total average deposits grew by $2.8 billion over the prior year, largely related to acquired deposits. Average interest-bearing transaction account balances increase d $2.5 billion . Average demand deposit balances increase d $219 million . Average short-term borrowings increase d $2.9 billion over the prior year, primarily from increased borrowings from federal funds purchased and the Federal Home Loan Banks. 

Our overall objective is to manage the Company&#8217;s balance sheet to be relatively neutral to changes in interest rates as is further described in the Market Risk section of this report. As shown in Table 21 , approximately 77% of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate loans or fixed rate loans that will re-price within one year. These loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either non-interest bearing, or that re-price more slowly than the loans. The result is a balance sheet that would be asset sensitive, which means that assets generally re-price more quickly than liabilities. Among the strategies that we use to manage toward a relatively rate-neutral position, we purchase fixed rate residential mortgage-backed securities issued primarily by U.S. government agencies and fund them with market rate sensitive liabilities. The liability-sensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the asset-sensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio. We also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk. 

The effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in Table 2 and in the interest rate sensitivity projections as shown in the Market Risk section of this report. 

Fourth Quarter 2019 Net Interest Revenue 

Tax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $273.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 , a decrease of $15.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 . CoBiz added $30.4 million to net interest revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $43.1 million to net interest revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 . The fourth quarter of 2019 included $5.8 million of net purchase accounting discount accretion and the fourth quarter of 2018 included $6.4 million. Net interest revenue decreased $28.9 million primarily due to three 25 basis point decreases in the federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve during 2019. This was partially offset by an increase of $13.1 million primarily due to the growth in average available for sale securities, fair value option securities, and loan balances. 

Net interest margin was 2.88% for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 3.40% for the fourth quarter of 2018 . The tax-equivalent yield on earning assets was 3.93% for the fourth quarter of 2019 , a decrease of 40 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 . Loan yields decrease d 34 basis points to 4.75% , primarily due to federal funds rate cuts in 2019. Yield on trading securities decrease d 91 basis points to 3.19% and the yield on fair value option securities decrease d 94 basis points to 2.62% . 

Funding costs decrease d 2 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 . The cost of interest-bearing deposits increase d 22 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2018 . The cost of other short-term borrowings decrease d 50 basis points. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 35 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2019 , down from 49 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018 , primarily due to a decrease in demand deposits and an increase in receivables from our trading activity. 

Average earning assets for the fourth quarter of 2019 increase d $4.4 billion over the fourth quarter of 2018 . Available for sale securities increase d $2.6 billion as the balance sheet is repositioned for the current rate environment. Fair value option securities held as an economic hedge of our mortgage servicing rights increase d $1.2 billion . Average loans, net of allowance for loan losses, increase d $661 million . 

Average deposits increase d $2.0 billion over the fourth quarter of 2018 . Average interest-bearing transaction accounts increase d $2.9 billion , partially offset by a decrease in average demand deposit balances of $1.0 billion . Average short-term borrowings increase d $2.8 billion . 

2018 Net Interest Revenue 

Tax-equivalent net interest revenue for 2018 was $993.8 million , up from $858.9 million for 2017 . The acquisition of CoBiz in the fourth quarter of 2018 added $43.1 million to net interest revenue, including $6.4 million of net purchase accounting discount accretion. Net interest revenue increased $55.5 million due to rates and $79.4 million from growth in earning assets. The benefit of an increase in short-term interest rates during 2018 on the loan portfolio and interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents yields was partially offset by higher borrowing costs. 

Net interest margin was 3.20% for 2018 compared to 2.92% for 2017 . The tax-equivalent yield on average earning assets increase d 62 basis points over 2017 , primarily due to increases in short-term interest rates resulting from four 25 basis point increases in federal funds rate during the year. Loan yields increase d 67 basis points. The yield on interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents increase d 70 basis points. The available for sale securities portfolio yield increase d 22 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increase d 52 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increase d 30 basis points and the cost of other short-term borrowings increase d 86 basis points. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 41 basis points for 2018 , compared to 23 basis points for 2017 , primarily due to interest rate increases during 2018. 

Average earning assets increase d $1.4 billion or 5% over 2017 with $950 million due to CoBiz. Average loans, net of allowance for loan losses, increase d $1.6 billion led by growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans. Trading securities balances increased $1.0 billion , primarily related to expanded U.S. mortgage-backed securities trading activity. The average balance of available for sale securities decrease d $144 million . Total average deposits grew by $624 million over 2017, including $859 million from the CoBiz acquisition. Excluding acquired deposits, average demand deposit account balances decreased $131 million, average interest-bearing transaction deposits decreased $62 million and average time deposit balances decreased $81 million. Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks increase d $325 million and funds purchased and repurchase agreements increase d $392 million compared to 2017.

Fees and commissions revenue 

Diversified sources of fees and commissions revenue are a significant part of our business strategy and represented 39% of total revenue for 2019 , excluding provision for credit losses and gains and losses on asset sales, securities and derivatives and the change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights. We believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to changes in interest rates, values in the equity markets, commodity prices and consumer spending, all of which can be volatile. As an example of this strength, many of the economic factors such as rising interest rates resulting in growth in net interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue, may also decrease mortgage banking production volumes. We expect growth in other operating revenue to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets. However, current and future economic conditions, regulatory constraints, increased competition and saturation in our existing markets could affect the rate of future increases. 

Brokerage and trading revenue, which includes revenues from trading, customer hedging, retail broker and investment banking, increase d $51.5 million or 48% over the prior year. 

Trading revenue includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily related to sales of residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies and related derivative instruments that enable our mortgage-banking customers to manage their production risk. Trading revenue also includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses on municipal securities, asset-backed securities and other financial instruments that we sell to institutional customers, along with changes in the fair value of financial instruments we hold as economic hedges against market risk of our trading securities. Trading revenue was $88.6 million for 2019 , an increase of $60.5 million over 2018 . Lower mortgage interest rates during 2019 increased customer mortgage-backed trading activities. In addition, trading revenue growth reflected a shift in the mix of our to-be-announced residential mortgage backed securities contracts from our customer hedging program to our trading program. 

Customer hedging revenue is based primarily on realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held for customer risk management programs. As more fully discussed under Customer Derivative Programs in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, we offer commodity, interest rate, foreign exchange and equity derivatives to our customers. Derivative contracts executed with customers are offset with contracts between selected counterparties and exchanges to minimize market risk from changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates. Customer hedging revenue totaled $18.9 million for 2019 , a decrease of $19.9 million or 51% compared to 2018 . 

Revenue earned from retail brokerage transactions totaled $16.1 million for 2019 , a decrease of $1.8 million or 10% compared to the prior year. Retail brokerage revenue is primarily based on fees and commissions earned on sales of fixed income securities, annuities, mutual funds and other financial instruments to retail customers. Revenue is primarily based on the volume of customer transactions and applicable commission rate for each type of product. 

Insurance brokerage fees were $13.9 million for 2019 , an increase of $9.7 million compared to the prior year due to a full year of operations with the addition of CoBiz in October, 2018. 

Investment banking, which includes fees earned upon completion of underwriting, financial advisory services and loan syndication fees, totaled $22.3 million for 2019 , an increase of $3.1 million or 16% compared to 2018 , related to the timing and volume of completed transactions. 

Transaction card revenue depends largely on the volume and amount of transactions processed, the number of TransFund automated teller machine (&#8220;ATM&#8221;) locations and the number of merchants served. Transaction card revenue totaled $87.2 million for 2019 , a $3.2 million or 4% increase over 2018 . Revenues from the processing of transactions on behalf of the members of our TransFund electronic funds transfer ("EFT") network totaled $77.3 million , up $1.1 million or 1% over 2018 . The number of TransFund ATM locations totaled 2,463 at December 31, 2019 compared to 2,426 at December 31, 2018 . Merchant services fees paid by customers for account management and electronic processing of card transactions totaled $8.8 million , an increase of $982 thousand over the prior year. 

Fiduciary and asset management revenue is earned through managing or holding of assets for customers and executing transactions or providing related services. Approximately 90% of fiduciary and asset management revenue is primarily based on the fair value of assets. Rates applied to those asset values vary based on the nature of the relationship. Fiduciary and managed asset relationships generally have a higher fee rate than non-fiduciary and/or managed relationships. 

Fiduciary and asset management revenue grew $7.7 million or 5% over 2018 primarily due to growth in managed fiduciary assets.

##TABLE_END

Primary rates disclosed in Table 6 above represent rates generally available to borrowers on 30 year conforming mortgage loans. 

Net gains on securities, derivatives and other assets 

As discussed in the Market Risk section following, the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") changes in response to changes in primary mortgage loan rates and other assumptions. We attempt to mitigate the earnings volatility caused by changes in the fair value of MSRs by designating certain financial instruments as an economic hedge. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are generally expected to partially offset changes in the fair value of MSRs. 

The net economic cost of the changes in fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was $17.9 million in 2019 , including a $53.5 million decrease in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, offset by a $30.4 million increase in the fair value of securities and derivative contracts held as an economic hedge and $5.2 million of related net interest revenue. 

The net economic cost of changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was $15.6 million in 2018 . The fair value of mortgage servicing rights increased $4.7 million . The fair value of securities and interest rate derivative contracts held as an economic hedge decreased $25.0 million . Net interest earned on securities held as an economic hedge was $4.8 million .

Non-GAAP measure to net interchange charges for 2015-2017 between transaction card revenue and data processing and communications expense as a result of the revenue recognition standard implemented January 1, 2018. This measure has no effect on net income or earnings per share. 

##TABLE_END 

Personnel expense 

Personnel expense increase d $80.3 million in 2019 . Regular compensation expense, which consists of salaries and wages, overtime pay and temporary personnel costs, increase d $36.0 million or 10% over 2018 . CoBiz employees added $33.9 million in 2019 and $13.5 million in 2018 . The remaining increase is primarily due to standard annual merit increases, which were effective for the majority of our staff on March 1. The average number of employees increased with the addition of CoBiz employees. 

Incentive compensation increase d $37.6 million or 29% compared to 2018 . The addition of CoBiz employees added $8.4 million to incentive compensation in 2019 and $2.9 million in 2018 . Cash-based incentive compensation plans, which are either intended to provide current rewards to employees who generate long-term business opportunities for the Company based on growth in loans, deposits, customer relationships and other measurable metrics or intended to compensate employees with commissions on completed transactions, grew $16.5 million over 2018 . 

Share-based compensation expense represents expense for equity awards based on the grant-date fair value. Non-vested shares generally cliff vest in 3 years and are subject to a two year holding period after vesting. The number of shares that will ultimately vest is determined by BOKF's change in earnings per share relative to a defined group of peer banks. Share-based compensation expense for equity awards increase d $11.3 million compared to 2018 , primarily due to an increase in the vesting probability of certain performance-based share awards. 

The Company currently offers a deferred compensation plan for certain executive and senior officers. Deferred compensation expense increase d $9.8 million compared to the prior year. Deferred compensation expense is largely offset by changes in the fair value of assets held in rabbi trusts for the benefit of participants, which is included in other gains (losses), net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 

Non-personnel operating expense 

Non-personnel expense increase d $23.3 million or 5% over the prior year. 

Intangible asset amortization increase d $11.0 million due to the addition of CoBiz. Occupancy and equipment expense increased $8.4 million or 9% , primarily related to CoBiz operations. Data processing and communications expense increase d $8.5 million or 7% primarily due to technology project costs. Mortgage banking expense increase d $4.4 million or 9% , primarily due to an increase in prepayments. 

Net losses and operating expenses of repossessed assets decrease d $10.3 million over the prior year mainly due to write-downs on a set of oil and gas properties and a healthcare property in 2018. Insurance expense decrease d $2.6 million or 11% , largely due to the elimination of a large bank deposit insurance surcharge assessed by the FDIC in the fourth quarter of 2018. 

Fourth Quarter 2019 Operating Expenses 

Other operating expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled $288.8 million , an increase of $4.2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 . The fourth quarter of 2018 included $14.5 million of CoBiz closing and acquisition costs. The discussion following excludes these costs. 

Personnel expense increase d $13.4 million over the fourth quarter of 2018 , primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation of $17.6 million . Share-based compensation expense increase d $5.6 million mainly due to changes in vesting assumptions related to the Company's earnings per share growth relative to a defined peer group. Deferred compensation expense increase d $6.1 million , which is largely offset by changes in the fair value of assets held in rabbi trusts for the benefit of participants. Cash based incentive compensation increase d $5.9 million due to increased sales activity. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in employee benefit costs of $3.6 million , primarily related to a reduction in employee insurance costs. 

Non-personnel expense increase d $5.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 , largely due to increases in data processing and communications expense and mortgage banking costs. 

2018 Operating Expenses 

Other operating expense totaled $1.0 billion for 2018 , a $41.5 million or 4% increase over 2017 . Closing and integration costs were $16.6 million and operating expenses related to CoBiz were $29.7 million in 2018 . 

Personnel expense increased $4.0 million in 2018. A $24.9 million increase in regular compensation expense largely as a result of the addition of Cobiz employees in the fourth quarter was partially offset by a $24.6 million decrease in incentive compensation due to changes in vesting assumptions. 

Non-personnel expense increased $20.9 million or 5% over 2017 . Occupancy and equipment expense increased $11.4 million, primarily related to the addition of CoBiz operating expenses and the new Oklahoma City office. Data processing and communications expense increased $6.3 million due to technology project costs. Insurance expense increased $3.7 million. The Company received $5.1 million in credits during 2017 related to the revision of certain inputs to the assessment calculation filed for years 2013 through 2016. Net losses and operating expenses of repossessed assets increased $7.4 million mainly due to write-downs on a set of oil and gas properties and a healthcare property. 

Mortgage banking expense decreased $6.6 million, largely due to a reduction in accruals related to default servicing and loss mitigation costs on loans serviced for others. Other expense decreased $5.7 million primarily due to reductions in litigation expenses and expenses related to merchant banking investments that were sold in 2017. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense was $130.2 million or 20.6% of net income before taxes for 2019 , $119.1 million or 21.1% of net income before taxes for 2018 and $182.6 million or 35.2% of net income before taxes for 2017 . 

In 2018, we completed our accounting for uncertainties that resulted from the Tax Reform Act. Resolution of these uncertainties decreased 2018 tax expense by $1.7 million. Excluding these adjustments, the 2018 effective tax rate would have been 21.4%. 

Net deferred tax liabilities totaled $26 million at December 31, 2019 compared to net deferred tax assets of $35 million at December 31, 2018 . We have evaluated the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible and determined that no valuation allowance was required in 2019 and 2018 . 

Income tax expense was $30.3 million or 21.5% of net income before taxes for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to $20.1 million or 15.7% of net income before taxes for the fourth quarter of 2018 .

Lines of Business 

We operate three principal lines of business: Commercial Banking, Consumer Banking and Wealth Management. Commercial Banking includes lending, treasury and cash management services and customer risk management products for small businesses, middle market and larger commercial customers. Commercial Banking also includes the TransFund EFT network. Consumer Banking includes retail lending and deposit services, lending and deposit services to small business customers served through our consumer branch network and all mortgage banking activities. Wealth Management provides fiduciary services, private bank services, insurance and investment advisory services in all markets. Wealth Management also underwrites state and municipal securities and engages in brokerage and trading activities. 

In addition to our lines of business, we have a Funds Management unit. The primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest rate risk. Each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the Funds Management unit as needed to support their operations. Operating results for Funds Management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities, securities gains and losses including impairment charges, the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off, tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines of business. The Funds Management unit also initially recognizes accruals for loss contingencies when losses become probable. Actual losses are recognized by the lines of business if the accruals are settled. 

The operations of CoBiz, acquired on October 1, 2018, were allocated to the operating segments in the second quarter of 2019. Prior to April 1, 2019, CoBiz operations were included in Funds Management and other. 

We allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution, which includes the allocation of funds, actual net credit losses and capital costs. In addition, we measure the performance of our business lines after allocations of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on statutory rates. 

The cost of funds borrowed from the Funds Management unit by the operating lines of business is transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics. Market rates are generally based on the applicable LIBOR or interest rate swap rates, adjusted for prepayment risk and liquidity risk. This method of transfer-pricing funds that support assets of the operating lines of business tends to insulate them from interest rate risk. 

The value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the Funds Management unit is also based on rates that approximate wholesale market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics. Market rates are generally based on LIBOR or interest rate swap rates. The funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their repricing characteristics reflected in a combination of the short-term LIBOR rate and a moving average of an intermediate term swap rate, with an appropriate spread applied to both. Shorter duration products are weighted towards the short term LIBOR rate and longer duration products are weighted towards the intermediate swap rates. The expected duration ranges from 30 days for certain rate-sensitive deposits to five years. During 2018, the funds transfer pricing rates for non-maturity deposits became inverted due to the flattening of the yield curve. Short term rates continued to increase while long term rates remained relatively flat. In order to appropriately reflect the organizational value of these deposits to the lines of business, effective January 1, 2019, we made adjustments that attribute more deposit credit value to the business lines, with the offset to Funds Management and other. 

Economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects management&#8217;s assessment of risk. This model assigns capital based upon credit, operating, interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units. The level of assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line, based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where possible. Average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts we have invested in the lines of business. 

As shown in Table 10 following, net income attributable to our lines of business increase d $81.8 million or 18% over the prior year. Net interest revenue grew by $135.2 million over the prior year, primarily due to the CoBiz acquisition combined with growth in average loan balances. Net charge-offs were up $9.8 million over the prior year. Other operating revenue increase d $62.1 million and other operating expense increase d $69.8 million .

Fees and commission revenue for 2017 has been adjusted on a comparable basis with 2019 and 2018 (Non-GAAP measure) to net interchange fees paid to issuing banks on card transactions processed by our TransFund merchant processing services for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the revenue recognition standard. 

##TABLE_END 

Net interest revenue increase d $109.3 million or 19% over the prior year, primarily due to the allocation of CoBiz to the business lines and an increase in average originated loan balances, along with increased yields. Yields on deposits sold to the Funds Management unit also went up due to the increase in short-term interest rates. Net loans charged-off increase d $8.7 million . 

Fees and commissions revenue increase d $6.7 million or 4% due to an increase in loan syndication fees based on the timing of completed transactions and an increase in revenues from the processing of transactions on behalf of the members of our TransFund EFT network, split almost equally. 

Operating expense increase d $50.4 million or 25% compared to 2018 . Personnel expense increase d $40.2 million or 33% primarily due to the incorporation of CoBiz employees combined with standard annual merit increases. Non-personnel expense increase d $10.1 million or 13% , primarily due to increased intangible asset amortization related to CoBiz. Corporate expense allocations increase d $6.4 million or 17% over the prior year. 

The average outstanding balance of loans attributed to Commercial Banking was up $3.0 billion or 20% over 2018 to $18.1 billion . See the Loans section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial condition following for additional discussion of changes in commercial and commercial real estate loans, which are primarily attributed to the Commercial Banking segment. 

Average deposits attributed to Commercial Banking were $10.3 billion for 2018 , a 21% increase compared to the prior year. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital for further discussion of change. 

Consumer Banking 

Consumer Banking services are provided through four primary distribution channels: traditional branches, the 24-hour ExpressBank call center, Internet banking and mobile banking. Consumer Banking also conducts mortgage banking activities through offices located outside of our Consumer Banking markets. In the first quarter of 2019, the strategic decision was made to exit our online lead buying business, HomeDirect, to focus more on our core competency of developing complete, long-term relationships with our clients through our traditional mortgage origination channel. 

Net income attributed to Consumer Banking totaled $56.6 million for 2019 , compared to $25.4 million in the prior year. Improved performance by Consumer Banking was largely due to the effect of changes in pricing of funds sold to the Funds Management unit combined with lower mortgage interest rates, which has increased mortgage banking activity and related revenue.

##TABLE_END

Net interest revenue from Consumer Banking activities grew by $38.8 million or 25% over 2018 , primarily related to increased yields on deposit balances sold to the Funds Management unit. Average consumer deposits grew $317 million with demand deposit balances up by $287 million or 15% , largely due to the allocation of acquired deposits. 

Fees and commissions revenue increase d $9.8 million or 6% compared to the prior year. Lower mortgage interest rates increased mortgage loan origination volumes. Mortgage production volume increase d $446 million or 18% and gain on sale margin increase d 18 basis points. Operating expense remained relatively flat compared to 2018 and corporate expense allocations were $2.8 million or 6% higher than in the prior year. 

Changes in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedges, as more fully presented in Table 7, resulted in a $23.1 million decrease to pre-tax net income for 2019 compared to a $20.4 million decrease to pre-tax net income in 2018 . 

Wealth Management 

Wealth Management contributed $95.3 million to consolidated net income in 2019 , up $9.3 million or 11% over the prior year. Prior year included an after tax benefit of $11.5 million as a result of a fee earned on the sale of client assets. Excluding this fee, net income for Wealth Management increased $20.8 million or 24% over 2018. This fee is excluded from the discussion below.

##TABLE_END

Net interest revenue decrease d $12.9 million or 11% over the prior year, largely due to decreased spreads on trading securities. Further, Wealth Management incurred additional funding costs related to an increase in non-interest bearing receivables on unsettled securities sales. Average loan balances were up $186 million or 13% over the prior year and average deposit balances increase d $831 million or 15% largely due to the allocation of acquired loans and deposits. 

Fees and commissions revenue increase d $60.3 million or 21% compared to the prior year. Brokerage and trading revenue increase d $50.5 million compared to the prior year due to increased trading activity as a result of lower mortgage interest rates. Fiduciary and asset management revenue increase d $7.6 million compared to 2018 . 

Operating expense increase d $19.6 million or 8% compared to the prior year. Personnel expense increase d $17.2 million primarily due to the combination of standard annual merit increases and the increase of incentive compensation as a result of higher trading activity. Non-personnel expense increase d $2.4 million or 3% over 2018 largely related to occupancy and equipment expense related to the new Oklahoma City office.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 1 &#160; 

As a result of the recent measurement accounting standard effective January 1, 2018, equity securities are no longer considered part of the available for sale portfolio and have been moved to other assets. 

##TABLE_END 

We maintain an inventory of trading securities in support of sales to a variety of customers, including banks, corporations, insurance companies, money managers and others. As discussed in the Market Risk section of this report, trading activities involve risk of loss from adverse price movement. We mitigate this risk within board-approved limits through the use of derivative contracts, short-sales and other techniques. These limits remain unchanged from levels set before our expanded trading activities. 

Investment securities consist primarily of intermediate and long-term, fixed rate Oklahoma and Texas municipal bonds and taxable Texas school construction bonds. The investment security portfolio is diversified among issuers. 

Available for sale securities, which may be sold prior to maturity, are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses, net of deferred taxes, are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders&#8217; equity. The amortized cost of available for sale securities totaled $11.1 billion at December 31, 2019 , an increase of $2.2 billion compared to December 31, 2018 . Available for sale securities consist primarily of U.S. government agency residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Both residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities have credit risk from delinquency or default of the underlying loans. We mitigate this risk by primarily investing in securities issued by U.S. government agencies. Principal and interest payments on the underlying loans are fully guaranteed. Commercial mortgage-backed securities have prepayment penalties similar to commercial loans. At December 31, 2019 , residential mortgage-backed securities represented 72% of total available for sale securities. 

A primary risk of holding residential mortgage-backed securities comes from extension during periods of rising interest rates or prepayment during periods of falling interest rates. We evaluate this risk through extensive modeling of risk both before making an investment and throughout the life of the security. Our best estimate of the effective duration of the combined residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio held in investment and available for sale securities portfolios at December 31, 2019 is 3.2 years. Management estimates the combined portfolios' duration extends to 4.0 years assuming an immediate 200 basis point upward shock. The estimated duration contracts to 2.5 years assuming a 100 basis point decline in the current low rate environment. 

The aggregate gross amount of unrealized losses on available for sale securities totaled $20 million at December 31, 2019 , a $118 million decrease compared to December 31, 2018 . On a quarterly basis, we perform an evaluation on debt securities to determine if the unrealized losses are temporary as more fully described in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. No other-than-temporary impairment charges were recognized in earnings in 2019 . 

Certain residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and included in Fair value option securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been segregated and designated as economic hedges of changes in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights. We have elected to carry these securities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current period income. These securities are held with the intent that gains or losses will offset changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related derivative contracts. Fair value option securities totaled $1.1 billion , an increase of $815 million due to an increase in the sensitivity of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights as mortgage interest rates declined significantly throughout 2019. See Market Risk section for further details. 

Bank-Owned Life Insurance 

We have approximately $390 million of bank-owned life insurance at December 31, 2019 . This investment is expected to provide a long-term source of earnings to support existing employee benefit programs. Approximately $301 million is held in separate accounts. Our separate account holdings are invested in diversified portfolios of investment-grade fixed income securities and cash equivalents, including U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt, asset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities. The portfolios are managed by unaffiliated professional managers within parameters established in the portfolio&#8217;s investment guidelines. The cash surrender value of certain life insurance policies is further supported by a stable value wrap, which protects against changes in the fair value of the investments. As of December 31, 2019 , the fair value of investments held in separate accounts was approximately $313 million. As the underlying fair value of the investments held in a separate account at December 31, 2019 exceeded the net book value of the investments, no cash surrender value was supported by the stable value wrap. The stable value wrap is provided by a domestic financial institution. The remaining cash surrender value of $89 million primarily represents the cash surrender value of policies held in general accounts and other amounts due from various insurance companies. 

Loans 

The aggregate loan portfolio before allowance for loan losses totaled $21.8 billion at December 31, 2019 , an increase of $94 million over December 31, 2018 . Growth in commercial and personal loan balances was partially offset by a decrease in commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans.

Commercial 

Commercial loans represent loans for working capital, facilities acquisition or expansion, purchases of equipment and other needs of commercial customers primarily located within our geographical footprint. Commercial loans are underwritten individually and represent ongoing relationships based on a thorough knowledge of the customer, the customer&#8217;s industry and market. While commercial loans are generally secured by the customer&#8217;s assets including real property, inventory, accounts receivable, operating equipment, interests in mineral rights and other property and may also include personal guarantees of the owners and related parties, the primary source of repayment of the loans is the on-going cash flow from operations of the customer&#8217;s business. Inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan for compliance with commercial lending policies. 

Commercial loans totaled $14.0 billion or 65% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 , growing $396 million or 3% over December 31, 2018 . This growth was led by a $383 million or 11% increase in energy sector loans. Healthcare sector loans were up $235 million or 8% . Wholesale/retail sector loans increase d $140 million or 9% . Service sector loans decrease d $136 million or 4% . Public finance loans decrease d $95 million or 12% . 

Table 16 presents our commercial loan portfolio distributed primarily by collateral location. Loans for which the collateral location is less relevant, such as unsecured loans and reserve-based energy loans, are distributed by the borrower&#8217;s primary operating location.

The majority of our commercial portfolio is located within our geographic footprint. At December 31, 2019 , the Other category is composed primarily of California totaling $583 million or 4% of the commercial portfolio, Florida totaling $248 million or 2% of the commercial portfolio, Louisiana totaling $169 million or 1% of the commercial portfolio, North Carolina totaling $163 million or 1% of the commercial portfolio, Pennsylvania totaling $157 million or 1% and Ohio totaling $140 million or 1% . All other states individually represent less than one percent of the total commercial loan portfolio. 

Supporting the energy industry with loans to producers and other energy-related entities has been a hallmark of the Company since its founding and represents a large portion of our commercial loan portfolio. In addition, energy production and related industries have a significant impact on the economy in our primary markets. Loans collateralized by oil and gas properties are subject to a semi-annual engineering review by our internal staff of petroleum engineers. This review is utilized as the basis for developing the expected cash flows supporting the loan amount. The projected cash flows are discounted according to risk characteristics of the underlying oil and gas properties. Loans are evaluated to demonstrate with reasonable certainty that crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids can be recovered from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at current pricing levels and with existing conventional equipment and operating methods and costs. As part of our evaluation of credit quality, we analyze rigorous stress tests over a range of commodity prices and take proactive steps to mitigate risk when appropriate. 

Outstanding energy loans totaled $4.0 billion or 18% of total loans at December 31, 2019 . Unfunded energy loan commitments decrease d by $246 million during the year to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2019 . Approximately $3.1 billion or 79% of energy loans were to oil and gas producers, a $188 million increase over December 31, 2018 . The majority of this portfolio is first lien, senior secured, reserve-based lending, which we believe is the lowest risk form of energy lending. Approximately 58% of the committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing oil and 42% of the committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing natural gas. Loans to borrowers in the midstream sector of the industry totaled $609 million or 15% of energy loans, an increase of $189 million over the prior year. Loans to borrowers that provide services to the energy industry totaled $177 million or 4% of energy loans, an increase of $1.4 million during 2019 . Loans to other energy borrowers, including those engaged in wholesale or retail energy sales totaled $67 million or 2% of energy loans, an increase of $4.6 million over the prior year. 

The services sector of the loan portfolio totaled $3.1 billion or 14% of total loans and consists of a large number of loans to a variety of businesses, including commercial services, Native American tribal governments, financial services, technology and media and education. Approximately $1.5 billion of the services category is made up of loans with individual balances of less than $10 million. Service sector loans are generally secured by the assets of the borrower with repayment coming from the cash flows of ongoing operations of the customer&#8217;s business. 

The healthcare sector of the loan portfolio totaled $3.0 billion or 14% of total loans and consists primarily of loans for the development and operation of senior housing and care facilities, including independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing. Healthcare also includes loans to hospitals and other medical service providers. 

We participate in shared national credits when appropriate to obtain or maintain business relationships with local customers. Shared national credits are defined by banking regulators as credits of more than $100 million and with three or more non-affiliated banks as participants. At December 31, 2019 , the outstanding principal balance of these loans totaled $4.5 billion, including $2.2 billion in the energy sector. Approximately 85% of shared national credits are to borrowers with local market relationships. We serve as the agent lender in approximately 17% of our shared national credits, based on dollars committed. We hold shared national credits to the same standard of analysis and perform the same level of review as internally originated credits. Our lending policies generally avoid loans in which we do not have the opportunity to maintain or achieve other business relationships with the customer. In addition to management&#8217;s quarterly assessment of credit risk, banking regulators annually review a sample of shared national credits for proper risk grading. 

Commercial Real Estate 

Commercial real estate represents loans for the construction of buildings or other improvements to real estate and property held by borrowers for investment purposes. The majority of commercial real estate loans are secured by properties within our geographic footprint, with the larger concentrations in Texas with 24% of total commercial real estate loans, Oklahoma with 12% of total commercial real estate loans and Colorado with 11% of the total commercial real estate portfolio at December 31, 2019 . We require collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, demonstrated cash flows in excess of expected debt service requirements, equity investment in the project and a portion of the project already sold, leased or permanent financing already secured. The expected cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates, vacancy rates and rental rates. As with commercial loans, inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan for compliance with applicable lending policies. 

Commercial real estate loans totaled $4.4 billion or 20% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 . The outstanding balance of commercial real estate loans decrease d $331 million compared to 2018 . Loans secured by office buildings decrease d $145 million or 13% . Loans secured by retail facilities decrease d $144 million or 16% . Other real estate loans decrease d $101 million or 18% . These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $78 million or 10% in loans secured by industrial facilities. The commercial real estate loan balance as a percentage of our total loan portfolio has ranged from 20% to 22% over the past five years. The commercial real estate segment of our loan portfolio distributed by collateral location follows in Table 17 .

While recent changes nationally in consumer purchasing trends from brick-and-mortar stores to online has created concern with regards to retail lending, our credit quality remains very good. The portfolio is highly diversified with no material exposure to a single borrower or tenant. 

Residential Mortgage and Personal 

Residential mortgage loans provide funds for our customers to purchase or refinance their primary residence or to borrow against the equity in their home. Residential mortgage loans are secured by a first or second-mortgage on the customer&#8217;s primary residence. Personal loans consist primarily of loans to Wealth Management clients secured by the cash surrender value of insurance policies and marketable securities. It also includes direct loans secured by and for the purchase of automobiles, recreational and marine equipment as well as unsecured loans. Residential mortgage and personal loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and are fully documented. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment stability. 

Residential mortgage loans totaled $2.1 billion , a $146 million or 7% decrease compared to December 31, 2018 . In general, we sell the majority of our fixed rate loan originations that conform to U.S. government agency standards in the secondary market and retain the majority of our non-conforming and adjustable-rate mortgage loans. We have no concentration in sub-prime residential mortgage loans. Our mortgage loan portfolio does not include payment option adjustable rate mortgage loans or adjustable rate mortgage loans with initial rates that are below market. Collateral for 93% of our residential mortgage portfolio is located within our geographic footprint. 

The majority of our permanent mortgage loan portfolio is primarily composed of various non-conforming mortgage programs to support customer relationships including jumbo mortgage loans, non-builder construction loans and special loan programs for high net worth individuals or certain professionals. Jumbo loans may be fixed or variable rate and are fully amortizing. The size of jumbo loans exceed maximums set under government sponsored entity standards, but otherwise generally conform to those standards. These loans generally require a minimum FICO score of 720 and a maximum debt-to-income ratio (&#8220;DTI&#8221;) of 38%. Loan-to-value ratios (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) are tiered from 60% to 100%, depending on the market. Special mortgage programs include fixed and variable rate fully amortizing loans tailored to the needs of certain healthcare professionals. Variable rate loans are fully indexed at origination and may have fixed rates for three to ten years, then adjust annually thereafter. 

At December 31, 2019 , $198 million of permanent residential mortgage loans are guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. We have minimal credit exposure on loans guaranteed by the agencies. This amount includes residential mortgage loans previously sold into GNMA mortgage pools that are eligible to be repurchased. We may repurchase these loans when certain defined delinquency criteria are met. Because of this repurchase right, the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans and must include them in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Permanent residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies increase d $6.9 million or 4% over December 31, 2018 . 

Home equity loans totaled $829 million at December 31, 2019 , an $88 million or 10% decrease compared to December 31, 2018 . Our home equity portfolio is primarily composed of first-lien, fully amortizing home equity loans. Home equity loans generally require a minimum FICO score of 700 and a maximum DTI of 50%. The maximum loan amount available for our home equity loan products is generally $400 thousand. Revolving loans have a 10 year revolving period followed by 15 year term of amortizing repayments. Interest-only home equity loans have a 5 year revolving period followed by a 15 year term of amortizing repayments and may not be extended for any additional revolving time. All other home equity loans may be extended at management's discretion for an additional 5 year revolving term subject to an update of certain credit information.

Loan Commitments 

We enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business as shown in Table 22 . Loan commitments may be unconditional obligations to provide financing or conditional obligations that depend on the borrower&#8217;s financial condition, collateral value or other factors. Standby letters of credit are unconditional commitments to guarantee the performance of our customer to a third party. Since some of these commitments are expected to expire before being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. None of the outstanding standby letters of credit were issued on behalf of customers whose loans are nonperforming at December 31, 2019 .

Customer Derivative Programs 

&#160; 

We offer programs that permit our customers to hedge various risks, including fluctuations in energy, cattle and other agricultural product prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Each of these programs work essentially the same way. Derivative contracts are executed between the customers and the Company. Offsetting contracts are executed between the Company and selected counterparties or exchanges to minimize market risk to us from changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates. The counterparty contracts are identical to the customer contracts, except for a fixed pricing spread or a fee paid to us as compensation for administrative costs, credit risk and profit. 

The customer derivative programs create credit risk for potential amounts due to the Company from our customers and from the counterparties. Customer credit risk is monitored through existing credit policies and procedures. The effects of changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates are evaluated across a range of possible options to determine the maximum exposure we are willing to have individually to any customer. Customers may also be required to provide cash margin or other collateral in conjunction with our credit agreements to further limit our credit risk. 

Counterparty credit risk is evaluated through existing policies and procedures. This evaluation considers the total relationship between BOK Financial and each of the counterparties. Individual limits are established by management, approved by Credit Administration and reviewed by the Asset/Liability Committee. Margin collateral is required if the exposure between the Company and any counterparty exceeds established limits. Based on declines in the counterparties&#8217; credit ratings, these limits may be reduced and additional margin collateral may be required. 

A deterioration of the credit standing of one or more of the customers or counter-parties to these contracts may result in BOK Financial recognizing a loss as the fair value of the affected contracts may no longer move in tandem with the offsetting contracts. This occurs if the credit standing of the customer or counterparty deteriorated such that either the fair value of underlying collateral no longer supports the contract or the customer or counterparty&#8217;s ability to provide margin collateral was impaired. Credit losses on customer derivatives reduce brokerage and trading revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 

Derivative contracts are carried at fair value. At December 31, 2019 , the net fair values of derivative contracts, before consideration of cash margin, reported as assets under these programs totaled $302 million compared to $427 million at December 31, 2018 . Derivative contracts carried as assets include foreign exchange contracts with fair values of $213 million , interest rate swaps primarily sold to loan customers with fair values of $47 million and energy contracts with fair values of $37 million . Before consideration of cash margin paid to counterparties, the aggregate net fair values of derivative contracts held under these programs reported as liabilities totaled $291 million . 

At December 31, 2019 , total derivative assets were reduced by $698 thousand of cash collateral received from counterparties and total derivative liabilities were reduced by $51 million of cash collateral paid to counterparties related to instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement. 

A table showing the notional and fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on both a gross and net basis is presented in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The fair value of derivative contracts reported as assets under these programs, net of cash margin held by the Company, by category of debtor at December 31, 2019 follows in Table 23 .

The largest exposure to a single counterparty was to a customer for an interest rate swap which totaled $4.7 million at December 31, 2019 . 

Our customer derivative program also introduces liquidity and capital risk. We are required to provide cash margin to certain counterparties when the net negative fair value of the contracts exceeds established limits. Also, changes in commodity prices affect the amount of regulatory capital we are required to hold as support for the fair value of our derivative assets. These risks are modeled as part of the management of these programs. Based on current prices, a decrease in market prices equal to the equivalent of $35.12 per barrel of oil would decrease the fair value of derivative assets by $22 million, with dealer counterparties comprising the bulk of the assets. An increase in prices equal to the equivalent of $73.05 per barrel of oil would increase the fair value of derivative assets by $225 million. Further increases in prices to the equivalent of $87.35 per barrel of oil would increase the fair value of our derivative assets by $478 million with lending customers comprising the bulk of the assets. Liquidity requirements of this program are also affected by our credit rating. A decrease in credit rating to below investment grade would increase our obligation to post cash margin on existing contracts by approximately $10 million. The fair value of our to-be-announced residential mortgage-backed securities and interest rate swap derivative contracts is affected by changes in interest rates. Based on our assessment as of December 31, 2019 , changes in interest rates would not materially impact regulatory capital or liquidity needed to support this portion of our customer derivative program. 

Summary of Loan Loss Experience 

We maintain an allowance for loan losses and an accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk. At December 31, 2019 , the combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk totaled $212 million or 0.98% of outstanding loans and 121% of nonaccruing loans, excluding loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. Excluding acquired loans measured at acquisition date fair value, the combined allowance for loan losses was 1.06% of outstanding loans and 127% of nonaccruing loans. The allowance for loan losses was $211 million and the accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk was $1.6 million . At December 31, 2018 , the combined allowance for credit losses was $209 million or 0.97% of outstanding loans and 134% of nonaccruing loans, excluding loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. The allowance for loan losses was $207 million and the accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk was $1.8 million . 

The provision for credit losses is the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses and an accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk at an amount determined by management to be appropriate based on its evaluation. The provision includes the combined charge or credit to expense for both the allowance for loan losses and the accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk. All losses incurred from lending activities will ultimately be reflected in charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses following funds advanced against outstanding commitments. Based on an evaluation of all credit factors, including changes in nonaccruing and potential problem loans during the year, net charge-offs, specific impairment of two shared national credit energy loans where the company is not the lead agent and growth in the loan portfolio during the year, the Company determined that a $44 million provision for credit losses was appropriate for 2019 . The Company recorded an $8.0 million provision for loan losses for 2018 .

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is assessed by management based on an ongoing quarterly evaluation of the probable estimated losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance consists of specific allowances attributed to certain impaired loans, general allowances based on estimated loss rates by loan class and non-specific allowances based on general economic conditions, concentration in loans with large balances and other relevant factors. 

Loans are considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will not collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreements. This includes all nonaccruing loans, all loans modified in trouble debt restructurings and all government guaranteed loans repurchased from GNMA pools. A specific allowance is required when the outstanding principal balance of the loan is not supported by either the discounted cash flows expected to be received from the borrower or the fair value of collateral for collateral dependent loans. At December 31, 2019 , impaired loans totaled $373 million , including $49 million with specific allowances of $17 million and $324 million with no specific allowances because the loan balances represent the amounts we expect to recover. At December 31, 2018 , impaired loans totaled $347 million , including $35 million of impaired loans with specific allowances of $8.7 million and $312 million with no specific allowances. 

General allowances for unimpaired loans are based on an estimated loss rate by loan class. Estimated loss rates for risk-graded loans are either increased or decreased based on changes in risk grading for each loan class. Estimated loss rates for both risk-graded and non-risk graded loans may be further adjusted for inherent risks identified for the given loan class which have not yet been captured in the loss rate. 

The aggregate amount of general allowances for all unimpaired loans totaled $176 million at December 31, 2019 , compared to $181 million at December 31, 2018 . Decreases in the general allowance for the commercial real estate loan portfolio of $8.2 million and residential mortgage portfolio of $3.6 million were partially offset by an increase in the commercial loan portfolio of $7.3 million . 

Nonspecific allowances are maintained for risks beyond factors specific to a particular portfolio segment or loan class. These factors include trends in the economy in our primary lending areas, concentrations in loans with large balances and other relevant factors. Nonspecific allowances totaled $17 million at December 31, 2019 , down from $18 million at December 31, 2018 . 

An allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category follows in Table 25 .

1 Represents ratio of loan category balance to total loans. 

Our loan monitoring process also identified certain accruing substandard loans, based on regulatory guidelines, that possess more than the normal amount of risk due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or the value of the collateral. Because the borrowers are still performing in accordance with the original terms of the loan agreements, and no loss of principal or interest is anticipated, these loans were not included in nonperforming assets. Known information does, however, cause management concern as to the borrowers&#8217; continued ability to comply with current repayment terms. These potential problem loans totaled $160 million at December 31, 2019 , composed primarily of $64 million or 2% of energy loans, $34 million or 1% of services loans, $21 million or 1% of healthcare loans and $14 million or 2% of manufacturing loans. Potential problem loans totaled $215 million at December 31, 2018 . 

Based on regulatory guidelines, other loans especially mentioned are in compliance with the original terms of the agreement, but may have a weakness that deserves management's close attention. Other loans especially mentioned totaled $210 million at December 31, 2019 and were composed primarily of $117 million or 3% of energy loans, $30 million or 1% of service sector loans, $18 million or 3% of manufacturing sector loans, $13 million or less than 1% of healthcare sector loans and $12 million or 2% of commercial real estate loans secured by retail facilities. Other loans especially mentioned totaled $182 million at December 31, 2018 . 

Net Loans Charged Off 

Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when the loan balance or a portion of the loan balance is no longer covered by the paying capacity of the borrower based on an evaluation of available cash resources and collateral value. Internally risk graded loans are evaluated quarterly and charge-offs are taken in the quarter in which the loss is identified. Non-risk graded loans are generally charged off when payments are between 60 days and 180 days past due, depending on loan class. In addition, non-risk graded loans are generally charged-down to collateral value within 60 days of being notified of a borrower's bankruptcy filing, regardless of payment status. 

BOK Financial had net loans charged off of $41 million or 0.19% of average loans for 2019 , compared to net loans charged off of $33 million or 0.18% of average loans in 2018 . 

Net commercial loans charged off totaled $41 million , primarily from $28 million of net charge-offs from energy loans and $9.8 million of net charge-offs from healthcare loans. Net commercial real estate loan recoveries totaled $3.8 million . Net recoveries of residential mortgage loans totaled $274 thousand for the year and net charge-offs of personal loans were $3.8 million . Net charge-offs of personal loans include deposit account overdraft losses.

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 &#160; 

Interest collected and recognized on nonaccruing loans was not significant in 2019 and previous years. 

##TABLE_END &#160; 

Nonperforming assets totaled $294 million or 1.35% of outstanding loans and repossessed assets at December 31, 2019 , a $27 million increase over the prior year. Nonaccruing loans totaled $181 million , accruing renegotiated residential mortgage loans totaled $92 million and real estate and other repossessed assets totaled $20 million . All accruing renegotiated residential mortgage loans and $6.1 million of nonaccruing loans are guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. Excluding assets guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, nonperforming assets increase d $22 million to $195 million or 0.90% of outstanding non-guaranteed loans and repossessed assets. The increase was primarily due to nonaccruing energy and multifamily commercial real estate, partially offset by a decrease in nonaccruing other commercial &#38; industrial loans and healthcare loans. The Company generally retains nonperforming assets to maximize potential recovery, which may cause future nonperforming assets to decrease more slowly. 

Loans are generally classified as nonaccruing when it becomes probable that we will not collect the full contractual principal and interest. As more fully discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we may modify loans in a troubled debt restructuring. Modifications may include extension of payment terms and rate concessions. We generally do not forgive principal or accrued but unpaid interest. All loans modified in troubled debt restructurings, except residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, are classified as nonaccruing. We may renew matured nonaccruing loans. All nonaccruing loans, including those renewed or modified in troubled debt restructurings, are charged off when the loan balance is no longer covered by the paying capacity of the borrower based on a quarterly evaluation of available cash resources and collateral value. Nonaccruing loans generally remain on nonaccruing status until full collection of principal and interest in accordance with the original terms, including principal previously charged off, is probable. We generally do not voluntarily modify personal loans to troubled borrowers. Personal loans modified at the direction of bankruptcy court orders are identified as troubled debt restructurings and classified as nonaccruing. 

Accruing renegotiated loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies represent residential mortgage loans that have been modified in troubled debt restructurings. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of troubled debt restructurings. Generally, we modify residential mortgage loans primarily by reducing interest rates and extending the number of payments in accordance with U.S. government agency guidelines. Generally, no unpaid principal or interest is forgiven. Interest continues to accrue based on the modified terms of the loan. Modified loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies under residential mortgage loan programs may be sold once they become eligible according to U.S. government agency guidelines.

Real Estate and Other Repossessed Assets 

Real estate and other repossessed assets are assets acquired in partial or total forgiveness of loans. The assets are carried at the lower of cost as determined by fair value at date of foreclosure or current fair value, less estimated selling costs. 

Real estate and other repossessed assets totaled $20 million at December 31, 2019 , composed primarily of $8.9 million of developed commercial real estate, $5.3 million of oil and gas properties, $3.9 million of 1-4 family residential properties, and $2.1 million of undeveloped land primarily zoned for commercial development. The residential properties and undeveloped land are widely disbursed across our geographical footprint. Real estate and other repossessed assets increase d $2.9 million compared to December 31, 2018 . 

Liquidity and Capital 

Based on the average balances for 2019 , approximately 61% of our funding was provided by deposit accounts, 24% from borrowed funds, less than 1% from long-term subordinated debt and 11% from equity. Our funding sources, which primarily include deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks, provide adequate liquidity to meet our operating needs. 

Subsidiary Banks 

Deposits and borrowed funds are the primary sources of liquidity for the subsidiary banks. Deposit accounts represent our largest funding source. We compete for retail and commercial deposits by offering a broad range of products and services and focusing on customer convenience. Retail deposit growth is supported through personal and small business checking, online bill paying services, mobile banking services, an extensive network of branch locations and ATMs and our ExpressBank call center. Commercial deposit growth is supported by offering treasury management and lockbox services. We also acquire brokered deposits when the cost of funds is advantageous to other funding sources.

Average deposits for 2019 totaled $25.7 billion and represented approximately 61% of total liabilities and capital compared with $22.8 billion and 65% of total liabilities and capital for 2018 . Average deposits increase d $2.8 billion over the prior year, largely related to the full year impact of the CoBiz acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2018. Acquired deposits were allocated to the lines of business from Funds Management and other in the second quarter of 2019. Demand deposits grew by $219 million . Interest-bearing transaction deposit account balances increase d by $2.5 billion and time deposits grew by $82 million . 

Average deposits attributed to Commercial Banking were $10.3 billion for 2019 , a $1.8 billion or 21% increase over 2018 . Interest-bearing transaction account balances increase d $1.7 billion or 65% and demand deposit balances increase d $78 million or 1% . Commercial customers continue to retain large cash reserves primarily due to a combination of factors including uncertainty about the economic environment and potential for growth, lack of preferable liquid alternatives and a desire to minimize deposit charges through the earnings credit. The earnings credit is a non-cash method that enables commercial customers to offset deposit service charges based on account balances. Commercial deposit balances may decrease as the economic outlook improves and if short-term rates move higher, enhancing their investment alternatives. 

Average Consumer Banking deposit balances increase d $317 million or 5% over the prior year. Average demand deposit balances grew by $287 million or 15% while average interest-bearing transaction accounts increase d $30 million or 1% . Time deposit balances increase d $51 million or 6% . 

Average Wealth Management deposit balances grew by $831 million or 15% over the prior year. Interest-bearing transaction balances increase d $908 million or 26% . Non-interest-bearing demand deposits decrease d $74 million or 6% , and time deposit balances decrease d $11 million or 1% .

##TABLE_END

See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of other borrowings. 

In addition to deposits, liquidity for the subsidiary banks is provided primarily by federal funds purchased, securities repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. Federal funds purchased consist primarily of unsecured, overnight funds acquired from other financial institutions. Funds are primarily purchased from bankers&#8217; banks and Federal Home Loan Banks from across the country. The largest source of wholesale federal funds purchased totaled $600 million at December 31, 2019 and $300 million at December 31, 2018 . Securities repurchase agreements generally mature within 90 days and are secured by certain available for sale securities. Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings are generally short term and are secured by a blanket pledge of eligible collateral (generally unencumbered U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, multifamily and other qualifying commercial real estate loans). Amounts borrowed from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka averaged $7.1 billion during 2019 and $6.2 billion during 2018 . 

At December 31, 2019 , the estimated unused credit available to BOKF, NA from collateralized sources was approximately $10.6 billion. 

BOKF, NA also has a liability related to the repurchase of certain delinquent residential mortgage loans previously sold in GNMA mortgage pools. Interest is payable monthly at rates contractually due to investors. 

Parent Company and Other Non-Bank Subsidiaries 

The primary sources of liquidity for BOK Financial are cash on hand and dividends from the subsidiary banks. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $215 million at December 31, 2019 . Dividends from the subsidiary banks are limited by various banking regulations to net profits, as defined, for the year plus retained profits for the two preceding years. Dividends are further restricted by minimum capital requirements. At December 31, 2019 , based on the most restrictive limitations as well as management&#8217;s internal capital policy, BOKF, NA could declare up to $ 246 million of dividends without regulatory approval. Dividend constraints may be alleviated through increases in retained earnings, capital issuances or changes in risk weighted assets. Future losses or increases in required regulatory capital could also affect its ability to pay dividends to the parent company. 

On June 27, 2016, the parent company issued $150 million of subordinated debt that will mature on June 30, 2056. This debt bears interest at the rate of 5.375%, payable quarterly. On June 30, 2021, we will have the option to redeem the debt at the principal amount plus accrued interest, subject to regulatory approval. 

As a result of the acquisition of CoBiz Financial, we obtained $60 million of subordinated debt issued in June 2015 that will mature on June 25, 2030. This debt bears interest at the rate of 5.625% through June 25, 2025 and thereafter, the notes will bear an annual floating rate equal to 3-month LIBOR plus 317 basis points. We also acquired $72 million of junior subordinated debentures. Interest is based on spreads over 3 month LIBOR ranging from 145 basis points to 295 basis points and mature September 17, 2033 through September 30, 2035. The junior subordinated debentures are subject to early redemption prior to maturity. 

Shareholders' equity at December 31, 2019 was $4.9 billion , an increase of $424 million over December 31, 2018 . Net income less cash dividends paid increase d equity $357 million during 2019 . Changes in interest rates resulted in accumulated other comprehensive income of $105 million at December 31, 2019 , compared to an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $73 million at December 31, 2018 . Capital is managed to maximize long-term value to the shareholders. Factors considered in managing capital include projections of future earnings, asset growth and acquisition strategies, and regulatory and debt covenant requirements. Capital management may include subordinated debt issuance, share repurchase and stock and cash dividends. 

On April 30, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to five million common shares, subject to market conditions, securities laws and other regulatory compliance limitations. As of December 31, 2019 , a cumulative total of 866,713 shares have been repurchased under this authorization. The Company repurchased 1,572,322 shares during 2019 at an average price of $82.35 per share, including shares purchased under a previous authorization. 

BOK Financial and the subsidiary banks are subject to various capital requirements administered by federal agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements, including capital conservation buffer, can result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material impact on operations including restrictions on capital distributions from dividends and share repurchases and executive bonus payments. These capital requirements include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items. The capital standards are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators. 

A summary of minimum capital requirements follows for BOK Financial on a consolidated basis in Table 32 .

As discussed further in Recently Issued Accounting Standard section following, the Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Assets Measured at Amortized Cost (&#8220;ASU 2016-13&#8221; or &#8220;CECL&#8221;) on January 1, 2020. The adoption of CECL is not expected to have a significant impact on capital. We plan to adopt the three year transition approach for regulatory capital purposes. 

Capital resources of financial institutions are also regularly measured by the tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity ratio. Tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity is shareholders&#8217; equity as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), including unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, less intangible assets and equity which does not benefit common shareholders. Equity that does not benefit common shareholders includes preferred equity. This non-GAAP measure is a valuable indicator of a financial institution&#8217;s capital strength since it eliminates intangible assets from shareholders&#8217; equity and retains the effect of unrealized losses on securities and other components of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Table 33 following provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures with financial measures defined by GAAP.

Payments on time deposits, other borrowed funds and subordinated debentures include interest which has been calculated from rates at December 31, 2019 . These obligations may have variable interest rates and actual payments will differ from the amounts shown on this table. 

Payments on time deposits are based on contractual maturity dates. These funds may be withdrawn prior to maturity. We may charge the customer a penalty for early withdrawal. 

Lease commitments generally represent real property we rent for branch offices, corporate offices and operations facilities. Payments presented represent the minimum lease payments and exclude related costs such as utilities and property taxes. 

Obligations under derivative contracts are used in customer hedging programs. As previously discussed, we have entered into derivative contracts which are expected to substantially offset the cash payments due on these obligations. 

Data processing and communications contracts represent the minimum obligations under the contracts. Additional payments that are based on the volume of transactions processed are excluded. 

Loan commitments represent legally binding obligations to provide financing to our customers. Some of these commitments are expected to expire before being drawn upon and the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Approximately $1.7 billion of the loan commitments expire within one year. 

The Company has commitments to fund an additional $82 million for various alternative investments. Alternative investments primarily consist of limited partnership interests in entities that invest in low income housing projects. Legally binding commitments to fund alternative investments are recognized as liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of newly adopted and pending accounting standards. 

On June 16, 2016 the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Assets Measured at Amortized Cost (&#8220;ASU 2016-13&#8221; or &#8220;CECL&#8221;) to provide more-timely recording of expected credit losses on loans and certain other financial assets. The Company adopted CECL on January 1, 2020, through a pre-tax, cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $61.4 million. 

The distribution of the cumulative-effect adjustment is summarized in Table 35 following.

##TABLE_END

CECL requires recognition of expected credit losses on assets carried at amortized cost over their expected lives, after appropriately considering prepayments and, in limited-circumstances, extensions and renewals. Expected losses are generally estimated through the use of models that measure probability of default and loss given default over a 12-month reasonable and estimable economic forecast period. Estimated losses after that period are generally measured by a reversion method that considers the direction and level of current risk in the portfolio applied over the remaining expected lives. 

Models are based on relevant macro-economic factors, such as gross national product, unemployment rate, and oil and gas prices, that consider three scenarios, Base, Upside and Downside. The probability of each scenario is weighted to determine the appropriate economic forecast factors. ##TABLE_START &#160;

Forward-Looking Statements 

This 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions, current expectations, estimates and projections about BOK Financial, the financial services industry and the economy generally. Words such as &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;forecasts,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Management judgments relating to and discussion of the provision and allowance for credit losses, allowance for uncertain tax positions, accruals for loss contingencies and valuation of mortgage servicing rights involve judgments as to expected events and are inherently forward-looking statements. Assessments that BOK Financial's acquisitions, including its latest acquisition of CoBiz Financial, Inc., and other growth endeavors will be profitable are necessary statements of belief as to the outcome of future events based in part on information provided by others which BOK Financial has not independently verified. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions which are difficult to predict with regard to timing, extent, likelihood and degree of occurrence. Therefore, actual results and outcomes may materially differ from what is expected, implied or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Internal and external factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to changes in commodity prices, interest rates and interest rate relationships, inflation, demand for products and services, the degree of competition by traditional and nontraditional competitors, changes in banking regulations, tax laws, prices, levies and assessments, the impact of technological advances, and trends in customer behavior as well as their ability to repay loans. BOK Financial and its affiliates undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
