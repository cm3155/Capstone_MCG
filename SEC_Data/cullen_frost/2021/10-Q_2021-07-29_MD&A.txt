Recent Developments Related to COVID-19 

Our business has been, and continues to be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic is ongoing and dynamic in nature, there are many uncertainties related to COVID-19 including, among other things, the ongoing impact to our customers, employees and vendors; the impact to the financial services and banking industry; and the impact to the economy as a whole as well as the effect of actions taken, or that may yet be taken, or inaction by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or to mitigate its impact (both economic and health-related). Refer to our 2020 Form 10-K for further information regarding (i) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and our results thereof, as well as the impact on our financial position and (ii) legislative and regulatory actions taken related to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly as they relate to the banking and financial services industry. 

Recent actions taken by the U.S. government to further mitigate the economic effects of COVID-19 will also have an impact on our financial position and results of operations. These actions are further discussed below. 

During the first quarter of 2021, President Biden signed a number of executive orders relating to stimulus and relief measures. These orders include, among other things, (i) an extension, through March 31, 2021, of the moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, (ii) an extension, through September 30, 2021, of the deferral of federal student loan payments and interest and (iii) an extension, through June 30, 2021, of certain mortgage forbearance programs and guidelines. 

On March 11 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the &#8220;ARP Act&#8221;) was enacted, implementing a $1.9 trillion package of stimulus and relief proposals. Among other things, the ARP Act provides (i) additional funding for the PPP program and an expansion of the program for the benefit of certain nonprofits, (ii) funding for the Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) to make targeted grants for restaurants and similar establishments, (iii) direct cash payments of up to $1,400 to individuals, subject to income provisions, (iv) an increase in the maximum annual Child Tax Credit, subject to income limitation provisions, (v) $300 a week in expanded unemployment insurance lasting through September 6, 2021 and makes $10,200 in unemployment benefits tax free for households, subject to income limitation provisions, (vi) tax relief making any student loan forgiveness incurred between December 31, 2020, and January 1, 2026 non-taxable income, and (vii) funding to support state and local governments; K-12 schools and higher education; the Centers for Disease Control; public transit; rental assistance; child care; and airline industry workers. 

On March 27, 2021, the COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension Act of 2021 was enacted, extending the bankruptcy relief provisions enacted in the CARES Act of 2020 bill until March 27, 2022. These provisions provide financially distressed small businesses and individuals greater access to bankruptcy relief. 

On March 30, 2021, the PPP Extension Act of 2021 was enacted, extending the Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) from it's previous expiration date of March 31, 2021 to June 30, 2021. Beginning June 1, 2021, the SBA may only process applications submitted prior to that date, and it may not accept any new loan applications. We are continuing to monitor the potential development of additional legislation and further actions taken by the U.S. government. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates 

We follow accounting and reporting policies that conform, in all material respects, to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and to general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

We consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial statements. 

Accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and off-balance-sheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management. In the case of loans, the allowance for credit losses is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 326 (&#8220;ASC 326&#8221;) Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. Refer to the 2020 Form 10-K for additional information regarding critical accounting policies. 

Overview 

A discussion of our results of operations is presented below. Certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable. Taxable-equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from tax-free loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a 21% federal tax rate, thus making tax-exempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields. 

Results of Operations 

Net income available to common shareholders totaled $116.4 million, or $1.80 per diluted common share, and $230.3 million, or $3.57 per diluted common share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $93.1 million, or $1.47 per diluted common share, and $140.3 million, or $2.21 per diluted common share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. 

Selected data for the comparable periods was as follows: 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Taxable-equivalent net interest income $ 279,997 $ 269,722 $ 543,946 $ 538,174 Taxable-equivalent adjustment 22,841 23,911 45,909 47,842 Net interest income 257,156 245,811 498,037 490,332 Credit loss expense &#8212; 31,975 63 207,172 Net interest income after credit loss expense 257,156 213,836 497,974 283,160 Non-interest income 91,247 77,601 184,483 290,516 Non-interest expense 215,254 199,679 425,396 423,842 Income before income taxes 133,149 91,758 257,061 149,834 Income tax expense\(benefit) 15,081 (1,314) 22,978 2,009 Net income 118,068 93,072 234,083 147,825 Preferred stock dividends 1,669 &#8212; 3,820 2,016 Redemption of preferred stock &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 5,514 Net income available to common shareholders $ 116,399 $ 93,072 $ 230,263 $ 140,295 Earnings per common share &#8211; basic $ 1.81 $ 1.47 $ 3.59 $ 2.22 Earnings per common share &#8211; diluted 1.80 1.47 3.57 2.21 Dividends per common share 0.72 0.71 1.44 1.42 Return on average assets 1.02 % 0.99 % 1.05 % 0.79 % Return on average common equity 11.18 9.60 11.16 7.24 Average shareholders&#8217; equity to average assets 9.46 10.30 9.77 11.08 

Net income available to common shareholders increased $23.3 million, or 25.1%, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and increased $90.0 million, or 64.1%, for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. The increase during the three months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily the result of a $32.0 million decrease in credit loss expense, a $13.6 million increase in non-interest income and an $11.3 million increase in net interest income partly offset by a $16.4 million increase in income tax expense and a $15.6 million increase in non-interest expense. 

The increase during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily the result of a $207.1 million decrease in credit loss expense and a $7.7 million increase in net interest income partly offset by a $106.0 million decrease in non-interest income, a $21.0 million increase in income tax expense and a $1.6 million increase in non-interest expense. Credit loss expense during 2020 was impacted by both our adoption of a new credit loss accounting standard and the adverse events impacting our loan portfolio, including those arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant volatility in oil prices. Non-interest income during 2020 was impacted by a $109.0 million net gain on securities transactions during the first quarter. Net income available to common shareholders during 2020 was also impacted by the reclassification of $5.5 million of issuance costs associated with our preferred stock to retained earnings upon redemption of the preferred stock. 

Details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is our largest source of revenue, representing 73.0% of total revenue during the first six months of 2021. Net interest margin is the ratio of taxable-equivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin. 

The Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. Our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate. The prime rate began 2020 at 4.75% and decreased 150 basis points in March 2020 to 3.25% where it remained through June 30, 2021. Our loan portfolio is also impacted by changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). At June 30, 2021, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR interest rates were 0.10% and 0.15%, respectively, while at June 30, 2020, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR interest rates were 0.16% and 0.30%, respectively. The target range for the federal funds rate, which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds, began 2020 at 1.50% to 1.75% and decreased 150 basis points in March 2020 to zero to 0.25% where it remained through June 30, 2021. As noted in our 2020 Form 10-K, the decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate in March 2020 was largely an emergency measure by the Federal Reserve aimed at blunting the economic impact of COVID-19. 

We are primarily funded by core deposits, with non-interest-bearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds. This lower-cost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment. See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk elsewhere in this report for information about our sensitivity to interest rates. Further analysis of the components of our net interest margin is presented below. 

The following table presents the changes in taxable-equivalent net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities. The changes in net interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average interest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each. The comparison between the quarters includes an additional change factor that shows the effect of the difference in the number of days in each period for assets and liabilities that accrue interest based upon the actual number of days in the period, as further discussed below.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2021 increased $10.3 million, or 3.8%, while taxable-equivalent net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $5.8 million, or 1.1%, compared to the same periods in 2020. Taxable-equivalent net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2021 included 181 days compared to 182 days for the same period in 2020 as a result of the leap year. The additional day added approximately $1.8 million to taxable-equivalent net interest income during the six months ended June 30, 2020. Excluding the impact of the additional day results in an effective increase in taxable-equivalent net interest income of approximately $7.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2021. The taxable-equivalent net interest margin decreased 48 basis points from 3.13% during the three months ended June 30, 2020 to 2.65% during the three months ended June 30, 2021 while the taxable-equivalent net interest margin decreased 65 basis points from 3.33% during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to 2.68% during the six months ended June 30, 2021. 

The increase in taxable-equivalent net interest income during the three months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily related to an increase in the average taxable-equivalent yield on loans and decreases in the average costs of interest-bearing deposit liabilities and other borrowed funds combined with increases in the average volumes of interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) and taxable securities. The impact of these items was partly offset by decreases in the average volume of tax-exempt securities and loans combined with a decrease in the average yield on taxable securities. The increase in taxable-equivalent net interest income during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily related to increases in the average volumes of loans and interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) combined with decreases in the average costs of interest-bearing deposit liabilities and other borrowed funds. The positive impact of these items was partly offset by decreases in the average yields on loans, interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) and taxable securities combined with decreases in the average volumes of tax-exempt and taxable securities and an increase in the average volume of interest-bearing deposit liabilities. The decreases in taxable-equivalent net interest margin during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily related to increases in the relative proportion of average interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) to average total interest-earning assets combined with the aforementioned decreases in market interest rates. Interest-bearing deposits made up approximately 31.1% of average interest-earning assets during the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to 14.2% during the same period in 2020 while interest-bearing deposits made up approximately 28.1% of average interest-earning assets during the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to 11.5% during the same period in 2020. 

The average volume of interest-earning assets for the three months ended June 30, 2021 increased $7.8 billion while the average volume of interest-earning assets for the six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $8.4 billion compared to the same periods in 2020. The increase in the average volume of interest-earning assets during the three months ended June 30, 2021 

included an $8.4 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) and a $125.6 million increase in average taxable securities partly offset by a $332.5 million decrease in average tax-exempt securities, a $303.2 million decrease in average loans and a $50.6 million decrease in average federal funds sold. The increase in the average volume of interest-earning assets during the six months ended June 30, 2021 included a $7.8 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve), a $1.2 billion increase in average loans (of which approximately $1.5 billion related to PPP loans, as further discussed below) partly offset by a $285.7 million decrease in average tax-exempt securities, a $175.6 million decrease in average taxable securities and a $138.4 million decrease in average federal funds sold. 

The average taxable-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets decreased 53 basis points from 3.24% during the three months ended June 30, 2020 to 2.71% during the three months ended June 30, 2021 while the average taxable-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets decreased 78 basis points from 3.52% during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to 2.74% during the six months ended June 30, 2021. The average taxable-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets during 2021 was impacted by the aforementioned changes in market interest rates and changes in the volume and relative mix of interest-earning assets. 

The average taxable-equivalent yield on loans increased 33 basis points from 3.95% during the three months ended June 30, 2020 to 4.28% during the three months ended June 30, 2021 while the average taxable-equivalent yield on loans decreased 20 basis points from 4.27% during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to 4.07% during the six months ended June 30, 2021. The average taxable-equivalent yields on loans during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were positively impacted by higher average yields on PPP loans but negatively impacted by lower average market interest rates compared to the same periods in 2020. The average volume of loans for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 decreased $303.2 million, or 1.7%, and increased $1.2 billion, or 7.3%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020. Loans made up approximately 40.2% and 42.2% of average interest-earning assets during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 50.0% and 49.4% during the same respective periods in 2020. 

In April 2020, we began originating loans to qualified small businesses under the PPP administered by the SBA under the provisions of the CARES Act. In 2020, we funded $3.3 billion of PPP loans of which approximately $3.2 million were funded during the second quarter of 2020. As of June 30, 2021, approximately $2.6 billion of these 2020 originated PPP loans have been forgiven by the SBA or repaid by the customer. During the first six months of 2021, we funded an additional $1.4 billion of PPP loans. As of June 30, 2021, approximately $116.7 million of these 2021 originated PPP loans have been forgiven by the SBA or repaid by the customer. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, we recognized $38.8 million and $62.3 million, respectively, in PPP loan related deferred processing fees (net of amortization of related deferred origination costs) as a yield adjustment and this amount is included in interest income on loans. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, we recognized approximately $19.3 million in PPP loan related deferred processing fees (net of amortization of related deferred origination costs). As a result of the inclusion of these net fees in interest income, the average yield on PPP loans was 6.89% and 5.60% during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the stated interest rate of 1.0% on these loans. The average yield on PPP loans during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was 4.13%. The increase in the average yield on PPP Loans during the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the average expected lives of the PPP loans funded in 2021 compared to 2020. Furthermore, the average fee percentage for 2021 originations was higher due to a smaller average loan size relative to 2020. For PPP loans funded through June 30, 2021, we expect to recognize additional PPP loan related deferred processing fees (net of deferred origination costs) totaling approximately $38.0 million as a yield adjustment over the remaining expected lives of these loans. Of this amount, we expect to recognize approximately 72% in 2021 and the remainder in 2022. 

The average taxable-equivalent yield on securities was 3.36% during the three months ended June 30, 2021, decreasing 17 basis points from 3.53% during the same period in 2020 while the average taxable-equivalent yield on securities was 3.38% during the six months ended June 30, 2021, decreasing 11 basis points from 3.49% during the same period in 2020. The average yield on taxable securities decreased 39 basis points from 2.40% during the three months ended June 30, 2020 to 2.01% during the three months ended June 30, 2021 while the average yield on taxable securities decreased 35 basis points from 2.38% during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to 2.03% during the six months ended June 30, 2021. 

The average taxable-equivalent yield on tax-exempt securities increased 2 basis points during both the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. The average taxable-equivalent yield on tax-exempt securities was 4.09% during both the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 4.07% during both three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. Tax exempt securities made up approximately 66.1% and 66.6% of total average securities during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 67.7% and 66.5% during the same periods in 2020. The average volume of total securities during the three months ended June 30, 2021 decreased $206.9 million, or 1.7%, compared to the same period in 2020 while the average volume of total securities during the six months ended June 30, 2021 decreased $461.3 million, or 3.6%, compared to the same period in 2020. Securities made up approximately 28.6% of average interest-earning assets during the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to 35.6% during the same 

period in 2020 while securities made up approximately 29.7% of average interest-earning assets during the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to 38.6% during the same period in 2020. The decreases during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily related to an increase in the relative proportion of interest-earning assets invested in interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve). 

Average interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) for the three months ended June 30, 2021 increased $8.4 billion, or 167.7%, compared to the same period in 2020 while average interest-bearing deposits for the six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $7.8 billion, or 206.8%, compared to the same period in 2020. Interest-bearing deposits made up approximately 31.1% of average interest-earning assets during the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to 14.2% during the same period in 2020 while interest-bearing deposits made up approximately 28.1% of average interest-earning assets during the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to 11.5% during the same period in 2020. The increases in the average volume of interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 were primarily due to increases in the average volume of customer deposits and, to a lesser extent, repurchase agreements. The average yield on interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) was 0.11% and 0.10% during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 0.10% and 0.49 % during the same periods in 2020. The average yield on interest-bearing deposits during 2021 and during the second quarter of 2020 were negatively impacted by a decrease in interest rates paid on such excess reserves held at the Federal Reserve. 

Average federal funds sold and average resell agreements for the three months ended June 30, 2021 decreased $50.6 million, or 70.3%, and $12.1 million, or 60.5%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2020 while average federal funds sold and average resell agreements for the six months ended June 30, 2021 decreased $138.4 million, or 91.3%, and $19.2 million, or 78.4%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2020. Federal funds sold and resell agreements were not a significant component of interest-earning assets during the comparable periods. The average yields on federal funds sold and resell agreements were 0.15% and 0.20%, respectively, during the three months ended June 30, 2021, compared to 0.18% and 0.59%, respectively, during the same period in 2020 while the average yields on federal funds sold and resell agreements were 0.17% and 0.19%, respectively, during the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to 0.93% and 1.20%, respectively, during the same period in 2020. The average yields on federal funds sold and resell agreements during 2021 were negatively impacted by lower average market interest rates. 

The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.10% during the three months ended June 30, 2021, decreasing 9 basis points from 0.19% during the same period in 2020 while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.10% during the six months ended June 30, 2021, decreasing 23 basis points from 0.33% during the same period in 2020. Average deposits increased $7.0 billion, or 22.2%, during the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 and included a $4.3 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits and a $2.7 billion increase in average non-interest bearing deposits. Average deposits increased $7.5 billion, or 25.5%, during the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 and included a $3.9 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits and a $3.6 billion increase in average non-interest bearing deposits. The ratio of average interest-bearing deposits to total average deposits was 57.0% and 56.9% during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to 56.0% and 58.2% during the same periods in 2020. The average cost of deposits is primarily impacted by changes in market interest rates as well as changes in the volume and relative mix of interest-bearing deposits. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits and total deposits was 0.06% and 0.04%, respectively, during the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to 0.14% and 0.08%, respectively, during the same period in 2020. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits and total deposits was 0.07% and 0.04%, respectively, during the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to 0.26% and 0.15%, respectively, during the same period in 2020. The average cost of deposits during 2020 and 2021 were impacted by decreases in the interest rates we pay on most of our interest-bearing deposit products as a result of the aforementioned decreases in market interest rates. 

In April 2020, we borrowed an aggregate $1.3 billion from the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) to provide additional liquidity in light of our significant PPP lending volume. These advances were subsequently paid-off in May 2020 as we determined additional liquidity resources were not necessary. Average FHLB advances totaled $439.6 million during the second quarter of 2020 while the average cost of these advances was 0.29%. The cost of the advances was partly offset by dividends received on the FHLB stock we were required to purchase in connection with the advances. The FHLB stock was redeemed in connection with the repayment of the advances. 

Our net interest spread, which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 2.61% and 2.64% during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 3.05% and 3.19 % during same periods in 2020. The net interest spread, as well as the net interest margin, will be impacted by future changes in short-term and long-term interest rate levels, as well as the impact from the 

competitive environment. A discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included elsewhere in this report. 

Our hedging policies permit the use of various derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, swaptions, caps and floors, to manage exposure to changes in interest rates. Details of our derivatives and hedging activities are set forth in Note 8 - Derivative Financial Instruments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Information regarding the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our derivative financial instruments is set forth in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included elsewhere in this report. 

Our net interest income and net interest margin have been, and we currently expect them to continue to be, impacted by the aforementioned decreases in market interest rates and the expectation that interest rates will remain at these low levels for some period of time in light of the on-going economic disruption arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our participation in the PPP, as discussed above, is expected to continue to positively impact net interest income and net interest margin in the near term. 

Credit Loss Expense 

Credit loss expense is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit loss accounts for various types of financial instruments including loans, securities and off-balance-sheet credit exposures after net charge-offs have been deducted to bring the allowances to a level which, in management&#8217;s best estimate, is necessary to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments. The components of credit loss expense were as follows: 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Credit loss expense (benefit) related to: Loans $ (4,379) $ 27,228 $ (4,379) $ 200,153 Off-balance-sheet credit exposures 4,379 4,775 4,444 7,062 Securities held to maturity &#8212; (28) (2) (43) Total $ &#8212; $ 31,975 $ 63 $ 207,172 

See the section captioned &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of credit loss expense related to loans and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. 

Non-Interest Income 

Total non-interest income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $13.6 million, or 17.6%, and decreased $106.0 million, or 36.5%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020. Excluding the $109.0 million in net gains on securities transactions during the six months ended June 30, 2020, total non-interest income increased $3.0 million, or 1.6%, during the six months ended June 30, 2021. Changes in the various components of non-interest income are discussed in more detail below. 

Trust and Investment Management Fees. Trust and investment management fees for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $6.8 million, or 21.9%, and increased $7.7 million, or 11.7%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020. Investment management fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees, making up approximately 81.8% and 80.2% of total trust and investment management fees for the first six months of 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in trust and investment management fees during the three months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to increases in investment management fees (up $4.7 million, or 18.6%) and estate fees (up $1.3 million). The increase in trust and investment management fees during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to increases in investment management fees (up $7.3 million, or 13.9%). Investment management fees and other custodial account fees are generally based on the market value of assets within an account and are thus impacted by volatility in the equity and bond markets. The increases in investment management fees during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily related to higher average equity valuations as well as an increases in the number of accounts. The increase in estate fees during the three months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily related to variation in transaction volumes. 

At June 30, 2021, trust assets, including both managed assets and custody assets, were primarily composed of equity securities (45.7% of assets), fixed income securities (31.7% of assets), alternative investments (9.5% of assets) and cash equivalents (8.4% of assets). The estimated fair value of these assets was $42.3 billion (including managed assets of $18.1 billion and custody assets of $24.2 billion) at June 30, 2021, compared to $38.6 billion (including managed assets of $16.9 billion and custody assets of $21.7 billion) at December 31, 2020 and $35.7 billion (including managed assets of $15.8 billion and custody assets of $19.9 billion) at June 30, 2020. 

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts. Service charges on deposit accounts for the three months ended June 30, 2021 increased $2.3 million, or 12.9%, while service charges on deposit accounts for the six months ended June 30, 2021 decreased $389 thousand, or 1.0%, compared to the same periods in 2020. The increase during the three months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily related to increases in overdraft charges on consumer and commercial accounts (up $887 thousand and $314 thousand, respectively) and an increase in commercial service charges (up $974 thousand). The decrease during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily related to decreases in overdraft charges on consumer and commercial accounts (down $1.2 million and $535 thousand, respectively) partly offset by an increase in commercial service charges (up $1.3 million). Overdraft charges totaled $6.9 million ($5.3 million consumer and $1.5 million commercial) during the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $5.6 million ($4.5 million consumer and $1.2 million commercial) during the same period in 2020. Overdraft charges totaled $14.4 million ($11.4 million consumer and $3.0 million commercial) during the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $16.1 million ($12.6 million consumer and $3.6 million commercial) during the same period in 2020. The fluctuations in overdraft charges during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily related to fluctuations in the volumes of overdrafts relative to the same periods in 2020. In April 2021, we implemented a new overdraft grace feature for certain consumer demand deposit accounts whereby no fees will be assessed on overdrafts of $100 or less, subject to certain qualifying conditions such as a minimum direct deposit. This new feature reduced overdraft charges on consumer accounts during the second quarter of 2021 by approximately $1.0 million. The impact on future quarters will depend on future overdraft volumes. 

Commercial service charges increased $974 thousand and $1.3 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. Commercial service charges during the three months ended June 30, 2021 were impacted by an increase in the volume of billable services relative to the same period in 2020. Commercial service charges during the six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily impacted by a lower average earnings credit rate. The earnings credit rate is the value given to deposits maintained by treasury management customers. Earnings credits applied to customer deposit balances offset service fees that would otherwise be charged. Because average market interest rates in 2021 have been lower compared to 2020, deposit balances have become less valuable and are yielding a lower earnings credit. 

Insurance Commissions and Fees . Insurance commissions and fees for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $105 thousand, or 1.0% and increased $933 thousand, or 3.4%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020. The increase during the three months ended June 30, 2021 was the result of an increase in commission income (up $171 thousand) partly offset by a decrease in contingent income (down $65 thousand). The increase during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was the result of an increase in contingent income (up $978 thousand) partly offset by a decrease in commission income (down $45 thousand). 

The increase in commission income during the three months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily related to an increase in life insurance commissions and commercial lines property and casualty commissions mostly offset by decreases in benefit plan commissions. The decrease in commission income during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily related to decreases in benefit plan commissions mostly offset by increases in life insurance commissions and commercial lines property and casualty commissions. The increases in commercial lines property and casualty commissions were related to increased market rates while the increases in life insurance commissions and decreases in benefit plan commissions were related to fluctuations in business volumes. 

Contingent income totaled $349 thousand and $4.0 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to $414 thousand and $3.0 million during the same periods in 2020. Contingent income primarily consists of amounts received from various property and casualty insurance carriers related to the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed. These performance related contingent payments are seasonal in nature and are mostly received during the first quarter of each year. This performance related contingent income totaled $3.1 million and $2.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in performance related contingent income during 2021 was related to growth within the portfolio combined with improvement in the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed. During the first quarter of 2021, a severe weather event in Texas resulted in a significant increase in property and casualty claims and losses. This deterioration in loss performance is expected to impact the determination of performance related contingent payments we receive in 2022; however, such impact is not determinable at this time. Contingent income also includes amounts received from various benefit plan insurance companies related to the volume of business generated and/or the subsequent retention of such business. This benefit plan related contingent income totaled $274 thousand and $899 thousand during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to $378 thousand and $986 thousand during the same periods in 2020, respectively. 

Interchange and Card Transaction Fees . Interchange fees, or &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, are charges that merchants pay to us and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Interchange and card transaction fees consist of income from debit and credit card usage, point of sale income from PIN-based card transactions and ATM service fees. Interchange and card transaction fees are reported net of related network costs. 

Net interchange and card transaction fees for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $1.7 million, or 56.5%, and increased $2.5 million, or 40.4%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to increased transaction volumes as well the impact of new card products partly offset by increases in network costs. Transaction volumes during second quarter of 2020 were more impacted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. A comparison of gross and net interchange and card transaction fees for the reported periods is presented in the table below. 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Income from card transactions $ 7,553 $ 5,527 $ 13,945 $ 11,332 ATM service fees 866 753 1,651 1,680 Gross interchange and card transaction fees 8,419 6,280 15,596 13,012 Network costs 3,778 3,314 6,862 6,791 Net interchange and card transaction fees $ 4,641 $ 2,966 $ 8,734 $ 6,221 

Federal Reserve rules applicable to financial institutions that have assets of $10 billion or more provide that the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. An upward adjustment of no more than 1 cent to an issuer's debit card interchange fee is allowed if the card issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve certain fraud-prevention standards. The Federal Reserve also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. 

Other Charges, Commissions and Fees . Other charges, commissions and fees for the three months ended June 30, 2021 increased $1.0 million, or 12.7%, compared to the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily related to an increase in income from the sale of mutual fund accounts (up $1.1 million) and, to a lesser extent, increases in funds transfer service charges (up $298 thousand), merchant services rebates (up $234 thousand), capital markets advisory fees (up $226 thousand) and income from the sale of annuities (up $174 thousand) partly offset by decreases in income from the placement of money market accounts (down $574 thousand), which was impacted by lower average market rates, and fees on unused commitments (down $567 thousand). Other charges, commissions and fees for the six months ended June 30, 2021 decreased $84 thousand, or 0.5%, compared to the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in income from the placement of money market accounts (down $1.7 million), which was impacted by lower average market rates, and a decrease in fees on unused commitments (down $1.0 million), among other things. These items were partly offset by increases in income from the sale of mutual funds (up $1.3 million), funds transfer service charges (up $308 thousand), merchant services rebates (up $228 thousand) and capital markets advisory fees (up $218 thousand). 

Net Gain/Loss on Securities Transactions . No securities were sold during the first six months of 2021. During the first quarter of 2020, we sold $483.1 million of residential mortgage-backed securities and realized a net gain of $1.9 million on those sales. The proceeds from these sales were reinvested into other residential mortgage-backed securities that had lower pre-payment rates. We also sold $519.1 million of 30-year U.S Treasury securities during the first quarter of 2020 and realized a net gain of $107.1 million on those sales. These U.S. Treasury securities were purchased during the fourth quarter of 2019 to hedge, in effect, against falling interest rates. Prior to their sale, these securities had significant unrealized holding gains as a result of decreases in market interest rates during the first quarter of 2020. We elected to sell these securities to provide liquidity and realize the gains. 

Other Non-Interest Income. Other non-interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2021 increased $1.8 million, or 23.6%, compared to the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily related to an increase in gains on the sale of assets (up $1.1 million) and increases in income from customer foreign exchange and derivative transactions (up $342 thousand and $276 thousand, respectively). Gains on the sale of assets include $1.8 million related to the sale of certain parking lots in downtown San Antonio in 2021 and $758 thousand related to the sale of a branch facility in 2020. Other non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2021 decreased $7.7 million, or 30.3%, compared to the same period in 2020. Other non-interest income during the six months ended June 30, 2020 included approximately $6.0 million in gains realized on the sale of certain non-hedge related, short-term put options on U.S. Treasury securities with an aggregate notional amount of $500 million. The put options were not exercised and expired in March 2020. The decrease in other non-interest income during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was also partly related to decreases in sundry and other miscellaneous income (down $2.2 million) and public finance underwriting fees (down $1.1 million). The decrease from these items was partly offset by an increase in gains on the sale of assets (up $1.1 million), as discussed above, and increases in income from customer derivative and foreign exchange transactions (up $317 thousand and $186 thousand, respectively). Sundry income during the first quarter of 2020 included $2.5 million related to the recovery of prior write-offs. The decrease in public finance underwriting fees was primarily due to a decrease in business volume. 

Non-Interest Expense 

Total non-interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $15.6 million, or 7.8%, and increased $1.6 million, or 0.4%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020. Changes in the various components of non-interest expense are discussed below. 

Salaries and Wages . Salaries and wages for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $6.7 million, or 7.4%, and increased $1.3 million, or 0.7%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020. Salaries and wages during the comparable periods were impacted by higher levels of salary costs deferred as loan origination costs in connection with the high volume of PPP loan originations. Most of the PPP loan originations occurred during the second quarter of 2020, for the first round of PPP funding, and during the first quarter of 2021, for the second round of PPP funding. Salary costs deferred in connection with PPP loan originations totaled $399 thousand and $4.0 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, as most of the 2021 PPP loan originations during these periods occurred during the first quarter. Salary costs deferred in connection with PPP loan originations totaled $5.5 million during both the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as all of the 2020 PPP loan originations during these periods occurred in the second quarter. Salary costs deferred in connection with loan originations are netted against loan origination fees and recognized as a yield adjustment component of interest income over the terms of the underlying loans. Salaries and wages during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were also impacted by decreases in salaries, due to a decrease in the number of employees, partly offset by increases in incentive compensation, commissions and stock based compensation compared to the same periods in 2020. 

Employee Benefits . Employee benefits expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 decreased $133 thousand, or 0.7%, and decreased $2.5 million, or 5.7%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020. The decreases were primarily related to decreases in certain discretionary benefit plan expenses and expenses related to our defined benefit retirement and restoration plans partly offset by increases in medical benefits expense and payroll taxes, among other things. 

Our defined benefit retirement and restoration plans were frozen in 2001 which has helped to reduce the volatility in retirement plan expense. We nonetheless still have funding obligations related to these plans and could recognize additional expense related to these plans in future years, which would be dependent on the return earned on plan assets, the level of interest rates and employee turnover. See Note 12 - Defined Benefit Plans for additional information related to our net periodic pension benefit/cost. 

Net Occupancy . Net occupancy expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $1.4 million, or 5.5%, and $2.1 million, or 4.0%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020. The increase during the three months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily related to increases in repairs and maintenance/service contracts expense (up $1.4 million) and depreciation on leasehold improvements (up $532 thousand), among other things, partly offset by a decrease in lease expense (down $754 thousand), among other things. The increase during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily related to increases in depreciation on leasehold improvements (up $1.2 million), and repairs and maintenance/service contracts expense (up $997 thousand), among other things, partly offset by a decrease in lease expense (down $552 thousand), among other things. 

Technology, Furniture and Equipment. Technology, furniture and equipment expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $2.0 million, or 7.5%, and $4.7 million, or 9.2%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020. The increase during the three months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily related to increases in cloud services expense (up $1.1 million), depreciation of furniture and equipment (up $689 thousand) and software maintenance (up $407 thousand). The increase during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily related to increases in cloud services expense (up $3.2 million), depreciation of furniture and equipment (up $1.3 million) and software maintenance (up $481 thousand). 

Deposit Insurance . Deposit insurance expense totaled $2.9 million and $5.8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to $2.8 million and $5.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. The increases were primarily related to increases in total assets partly offset by a decrease in the assessment rate. 

Other Non-Interest Expense . Other non-interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $5.7 million, or 15.7%, and decreased $4.3 million, or 5.2%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020. The increase during the three months ended June 30, 2021 included increases in donations expense (up $2.0 million); advertising/promotions expense (up $1.8 million); fraud losses (up $873 thousand); and business development expense (up $338 thousand); among other things. The increase was also partly due to a decrease in costs deferred as loan origination costs, down $1.6 million primarily in connection with the high volume of PPP loan originations during the second quarter of 2020. Costs deferred in connection with loan originations are netted against loan origination fees and recognized as a yield adjustment component of interest income over the remaining terms of the underlying loans. Donations expense during the second quarter of 2021 was impacted by a $1.8 million contribution to the Frost Charitable Foundation. The increases in advertising/promotions expense and business development expense reflect the lower spending levels in 2020 due in part to the Covid-19 pandemic. The impact 

of the aforementioned items was partly offset by decreases in outside computer service expense (down $1.0 million); and travel, meals and entertainment expense (down $538 thousand); among other things. 

The decrease in other non-interest expense during the six months ended June 30, 2021 included decreases in travel, meals and entertainment expense (down $3.4 million); outside computer service expense (down $2.2 million); professional services expense (down $1.8 million); advertising/promotions expense (down $1.2 million); business development expense (down $817 thousand); and stationery, printing and supplies expense (down $665 thousand); among other things. The impact of these items was partly offset by increases in donations expense (up $2.6 million); sundry and other miscellaneous expense (up $2.1 million); and fraud losses (up $1.3 million), among other things. Donations expense during the first six months of 2021 was impacted by $3.3 million in contributions to the Frost Charitable Foundation. 

Results of Segment Operations 

We are managed under a matrix organizational structure whereby our two primary operating segments, Banking and Frost Wealth Advisors, overlap a regional reporting structure. A third operating segment, Non-Banks, is for the most part the parent holding company, as well as certain other insignificant non-bank subsidiaries of the parent that, for the most part, have little or no activity. A description of each segment, the methodologies used to measure segment financial performance and summarized operating results by segment are described in Note 15 - Operating Segments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Segment operating results are discussed in more detail below. 

Banking 

Net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $18.2 million, or 19.7%, and $75.8 million, or 52.4%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020. The increase during the three months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily the result of a $32.0 million decrease in credit loss expense, an $11.2 million increase in net interest income and a $6.0 million increase in non-interest income partly offset by a $16.5 million increase in non-interest expense and a $14.5 million increase in income tax expense. The increase during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily the result of a $207.1 million decrease in credit loss expense and a $7.4 million increase in net interest income partly offset by a $113.6 million decrease in non-interest income, an $18.5 million increase in income tax expense and a $6.7 million increase in non-interest expense. 

Net interest income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $11.2 million, or 4.5%, and $7.4 million, or 1.5%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020. The increase during the three months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily related to an increase in the average taxable-equivalent yield on loans and decreases in the average costs of interest-bearing deposit liabilities and other borrowed funds combined with increases in the average volumes of interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) and taxable securities. The impact of these items was partly offset by decreases in average volume of tax-exempt securities and loans combined with a decrease in the average yield on taxable securities. The increase in net interest income during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily related to increases in the average volumes of loans and interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) combined with decreases in the average costs of interest-bearing deposit liabilities and other borrowed funds. The impact of these items was partly offset by decreases in the average yields on loans, interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) and taxable securities combined with decreases in the average volumes of tax-exempt and taxable securities and an increase in the average volume of interest-bearing deposit liabilities. Net interest income for the first six months of 2020 was also positively impacted by the additional day as a result of leap year. See the analysis of net interest income included in the section captioned &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

There was no credit loss expense for the three months ended June 30, 2021 while credit loss expense totaled $32.0 million for the same period in 2020. Credit loss expense totaled $63 thousand during the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $207.2 million for the same period in 2020. See the sections captioned &#8220;Credit Loss Expense&#8221; and &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of credit loss expense related to loans and off-balance-sheet commitments. 

Non-interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2021 increased $6.0 million, or 14.1%, compared to the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily due to increases in service charges on deposit accounts, other non-interest income and interchange and debit card transactions fees. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts was primarily related to increases in overdraft charges on consumer and commercial accounts and an increase in commercial service charges. The increase in interchange and debit card transactions fees was due to increased transaction volumes partly offset by increases in network costs. The increase in other non-interest income was primarily related to an increase in gains on the sale of assets and increases in income from customer foreign exchange and derivative transactions. 

Non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2021 decreased $113.6 million, or 52.5%, compared to the same period in 2020. Non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2020 included a $109.0 million net gain on securities transactions recognized during the first quarter. Excluding the net gain on securities transactions, total non-interest income for the Banking segment decreased $4.6 million, or 4.3%, during the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in other non-interest income partly offset by increases in interchange and card transaction fees and in insurance commissions and fees. Other non-interest income during the six months ended June 30, 2020 included approximately $6.0 million in gains realized on the sale of certain non-hedge related, short-term put options on U.S. Treasury securities with an aggregate notional amount of $500 million during the first quarter. The put options were not exercised and expired in March 2020. The decrease in other non-interest income during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was also partly related to decreases in sundry and other miscellaneous income and public finance underwriting fees. The decrease from these items was partly offset by an increase in gains on the sale of assets and increases in income from customer derivative and foreign exchange transactions. The increase in interchange and debit card transactions fees was due to increased transaction volumes partly offset by increases in network costs. The increase in insurance commissions and fees was the result of an increase in contingent income partly offset by a decrease in commission income, which is further discussed below in relation to Frost Insurance Agency. See the analysis of these categories of non-interest income included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Non-interest expense increased $16.5 million, or 9.9%, for three months ended June 30, 2021 and $6.7 million, or 1.9%, for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to the same periods in 2020. The increase during the three months ended was primarily due to increases in salaries and wages; other non-interest expense; technology, furniture and equipment expense; and net occupancy expense. The increase during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to increases in technology, furniture and equipment expense; salaries and wages; and net occupancy expense partly offset by decreases in employee benefits expense and other non-interest expense. Salaries and wages during the first quarter of 2021 and the second quarter of 2020 were impacted by higher levels of salary costs deferred as loan origination costs primarily in connection with the high volume of PPP loan originations during those quarters. These costs are netted against loan origination fees and recognized as a yield adjustment component of interest income over the remaining terms of the underlying loans. Salaries and wages during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were also impacted by decreases in salaries, due to a decrease in the number of employees, partly offset by increases in incentive compensation, commissions and stock based compensation compared to the same periods in 2020. The increase in other non-interest expense during the three months ended June 30, 2021 included increases in donations expense; advertising/promotions expense; fraud losses; sundry and other miscellaneous expense and business development expense; among other things. The increase was also partly due to a decrease in costs deferred as loan origination costs primarily in connection with the high volume of PPP loan originations during the second quarter of 2020. Costs deferred in connection with loan originations are recognized as a yield adjustment component of interest income over the remaining terms of the underlying loans. The impact of the aforementioned items was partly offset by decreases in outside computer service expense; and travel, meals and entertainment expense; among other things. The decrease in other non-interest expense during the six months ended June 30, 2021 included decreases in travel, meals and entertainment expense; outside computer service expense; professional services expense; advertising/promotions expense; business development expense; and stationery, printing and supplies expense; among other things. The impact of these items was partly offset by increases in donations expense and fraud losses, among other things. The increase in technology, furniture and equipment expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily related to increases in cloud services expense, depreciation of furniture and equipment and software maintenance. The increase in net occupancy expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily related to increases in repairs and maintenance/service contracts expense and depreciation on leasehold improvements, among other things, partly offset by decreases in lease expense, among other things. The decrease in employee benefits expense during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily related to decreases in certain discretionary benefit plan expenses and expenses related to our defined benefit retirement and restoration plans partly offset by increases in medical benefits expense and payroll taxes, among other things. See the analysis of these categories of non-interest expense included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Expense&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Frost Insurance Agency, which is included in the Banking operating segment, had gross commission revenues of $10.8 million and $28.2 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $10.7 million and $27.2 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily the result of an increase in performance related contingent income partly offset by a decrease in commission income. The increase in performance related contingent income during 2021 was related to growth within the portfolio combined with improvement in the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed. Commission income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 was impacted by decreases in benefit plan commissions and increases in life insurance commissions and commercial lines property and casualty commissions. See the analysis of insurance commissions and fees included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Frost Wealth Advisors 

Net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $6.4 million, or 162.2%, and $8.8 million, or 92.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020. The increase during the three months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily the result of a $7.6 million increase in non-interest income and a $623 thousand decrease in non-interest expense partly offset by a $1.7 million increase in income tax expense and a $176 thousand decrease in net interest income. The increase during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily the result of a $7.5 million increase in non-interest income and a $4.2 million decrease in non-interest expense partly offset by a $2.3 million increase in income tax expense and a $567 thousand decrease in net interest income. 

Net interest income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 decreased $176 thousand, or 25.7%, and $567 thousand, or 36.3%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020. These decreases were primarily due to decreases in the average funds transfer prices allocated to the funds provided by Frost Wealth Advisors. The decreases in the average funds transfer price was primarily due to decreases in market interest rates. See the analysis of net interest income included in the section captioned &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Non-interest income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $7.6 million, or 21.80%, and $7.5 million, or 10.0%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020. The increases were primarily due to increases in trust and investment management fees. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, the increase was also partly due, to a lesser extent, to an increase in other charges, commissions and fees. Trust and investment management fee income is the most significant income component for Frost Wealth Advisors. Investment management fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees, making up approximately 81.8% of total trust and investment management fees for the first six months of 2021. The increases in trust and investment management fees during the comparable periods were primarily due to increases in investment management fees. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, the increase in trust and investment management fees was also partly related to an increase in estate fees. The increases in investment management fees during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily related to higher average equity valuations as well as an increase in the number of accounts. The increase in estate fees during the three months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily related to variation in transaction volumes. The increase in other charges, commissions and fees during the three months June 30, 2021 was primarily related to an increase in income from the sale of mutual fund accounts and income from the sale of annuities partly offset by a decrease in income from the placement of money market accounts, which was impacted by lower average market rates. See the analysis of trust and investment management fees and other charges, commissions and fees included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Non-interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 decreased $623 thousand, or 2.0% and $4.2 million, or 6.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020. The decrease during the three months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to decreases in employee benefit expense and other non-interest expense partly offset by an increase in technology, furniture and equipment expense. The decrease during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to decreases in other non-interest expense, employee benefit expense and salaries and wages partly offset by an increase in technology, furniture and equipment expense. The decreases in employee benefit expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily due to decreases in certain discretionary benefit plan expenses, among other things. The decreases in other non-interest expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily related to decreases in outside computer service expense; professional service expense; and travel, meals and entertainment expense partly offset by increases in subscriptions expense. The decrease in salaries and wages during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in salaries, due to a decrease in the number of employees, partly offset by an increase commission and incentive compensation. The increases in technology, furniture and equipment expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily related to increases in cloud service expenses partly offset by decreases in service contract expenses. 

Non-Banks 

The Non-Banks operating segment had net losses of $2.9 million and $4.5 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to net losses of $3.3 million and $6.2 million during the same periods in 2020. The decreases in the net losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily due to decreases in net interest expense and other non-interest expense. The decreases in net interest expense were primarily related to decreases in the average rates paid on our long term borrowings. The decreases in other non-interest expense were primarily due to decreases in professional services expense and travel, meals and entertainment expense. 

Income Taxes 

During the three months ended June 30, 2021, we recognized income tax expense of $15.1 million, for an effective tax rate of 11.3%, compared to an income tax benefit of $1.3 million, for an effective tax rate of negative 1.4%, for the same period in 2020. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, we recognized income tax expense of $23.0 million, for an effective tax rate of 8.9%, compared to income tax expense of $2.0 million, for an effective tax rate of 1.3%, for the same period in 2020. 

The effective income tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 21% during 2021 and 2020 primarily due to the effect of tax-exempt income from loans, securities and life insurance policies and the income tax effects associated with stock-based compensation, among other things, and their relative proportion to total pre-tax net income. The increase in the effective tax rate during 2021 was primarily related to an increase in pre-tax net income, partly off-set by the impact of higher discrete tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. The effective tax rates during 2020 were also impacted by a one-time, discrete tax benefit associated with an asset contribution to a charitable trust during the second quarter. 

Average Balance Sheet 

Average assets totaled $44.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021 representing an increase of $8.4 billion, or 23.6%, compared to average assets for the same period in 2020. Earning assets increased $8.4 billion, or 25.5%, during the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The increase in earning assets was primarily related to a $7.8 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) and a $1.2 billion increase in average loans partly offset by a $285.7 million decrease in average tax-exempt securities, a $175.6 million decrease in average taxable securities, a $138.4 million decrease in average federal funds sold and a $19.2 million decrease in average resell agreements. Average deposits increased $7.5 billion, or 25.5%, during the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Growth in average deposits was related to increased customer balances, impacted by the unprecedented amount of stimulus dollars injected into the economy, as well as new customer accounts. The increase included a $3.6 billion increase in non-interest bearing deposits and a $3.9 billion increase in interest-bearing deposit accounts. Average non-interest bearing deposits made up 43.1% and 41.8% of average total deposits during the first six months of 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Loans 

Details of our loan portfolio are presented in Note 3 - Loans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Loans decreased $885.0 million, or 5.1%, from $17.5 billion at December 31, 2020 to $16.6 billion at June 30, 2021. As further discussed below, during the second quarter of 2020, we began originating loans to qualified small businesses under the PPP administered by the SBA under the provisions of the CARES Act. Excluding PPP loans, total loans would have otherwise decreased $378.0 million, or 2.5%, from $15.0 billion at December 31, 2020 to $14.7 billion at June 30, 2021, and decreased $668.8 million, or 4.4%, from total loans of $15.3 billion at March 31, 2020, near the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans, energy loans, and real estate loans. Real estate loans include both commercial and consumer balances. Selected details related to our loan portfolio segments are presented below. Refer to our 2020 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of our loan origination and risk management processes. 

Commercial and Industrial. Commercial and industrial loans decreased $200.0 million, or 4.0%, from $5.0 billion at December 31, 2020 to $4.8 billion at June 30, 2021. Our commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans to small, medium and large businesses. The purpose of these loans varies from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment. While some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis, most are secured by the assets being financed with collateral margins that are consistent with our loan policy guidelines. The commercial and industrial loan portfolio also includes commercial leases and purchased shared national credits ("SNC"s). 

Energy . Energy loans include loans to entities and individuals that are engaged in various energy-related activities including (i) the development and production of oil or natural gas, (ii) providing oil and gas field servicing, (iii) providing energy-related transportation services, (iv) providing equipment to support oil and gas drilling, (v) refining petrochemicals, or (vi) trading oil, gas and related commodities. Energy loans decreased $212.0 million, or 17.2%, from $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020 to $1.0 billion at June 30, 2021. We have recently made efforts to reduce our exposure to energy loans. Nonetheless energy loans remain our largest industry concentration totaling 6.2% of total loans (7.0% excluding PPP loans) at June 30, 2021, down from 7.1% of total loans (8.2% excluding PPP loans) at December 31, 2020. The average loan size, the significance of the portfolio and the specialized nature of the energy industry requires a highly prescriptive underwriting policy. Exceptions to this policy are rarely granted. Due to the large borrowing requirements of this customer base, the energy loan portfolio includes participations and SNCs. 

Purchased Shared National Credits. Purchased shared national credits are participations purchased from upstream financial organizations and tend to be larger in size than our originated portfolio. Our purchased SNC portfolio totaled $623.6 million at June 30, 2021, decreasing $164.5 million, or 20.9%, from $788.1 million at December 31, 2020. At June 30, 2021, 30.1% of outstanding purchased SNCs were related to the energy industry while 23.0% were related to the construction industry, 15.4% were related to the real estate management industry and 14% were related to the financial services industry. The remaining purchased SNCs were diversified throughout various other industries, with no other single industry exceeding 10% of the total purchased SNC portfolio. Additionally, almost all of the outstanding balance of purchased SNCs was included in the energy and commercial and industrial portfolio, with the remainder included in the real estate categories. SNC participations are originated in the normal course of business to meet the needs of our customers. As a matter of policy, we generally only participate in SNCs for companies headquartered in or which have significant operations within our market areas. In addition, we must have direct access to the company&#8217;s management, an existing banking relationship or the expectation of broadening the relationship with other banking products and services within the following 12 to 24 months. SNCs are reviewed at least quarterly for credit quality and business development successes. 

Commercial Real Estate. Commercial real estate loans increased $35.6 million, or 0.5%, from $7.0 billion at December 31, 2020 to $7.1 billion at June 30, 2021. Commercial real estate loans represented 83.9% of total real estate loans at June 30, 2021 compared to 84.1% at December 31, 2020. The majority of our commercial real estate loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate mortgages, which includes both permanent and intermediate term loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Consequently, these loans must undergo the analysis and underwriting process of a commercial and industrial loan, as well as that of a real estate loan. At June 30, 2021, approximately 47.8% of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans were secured by owner-occupied properties. 

Consumer Real Estate and Other Consumer Loans. The consumer loan portfolio, including all consumer real estate and consumer installment loans, totaled $1.8 billion at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Consumer real estate loans increased $21.2 million, or 1.6%, from December 31, 2020. Combined, home equity loans and lines of credit made up 58.7% and 58.8% of the consumer real estate loan total at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. We offer home equity loans up to 80% of the estimated value of the personal residence of the borrower, less the value of existing mortgages and home improvement loans. In general, we do not originate 1-4 family mortgage loans; however, from time to time, we may invest in such loans to meet the needs of our customers or for other regulatory compliance purposes. Consumer and other loans decreased $22.7 million, or 4.5%, from December 31, 2020. The consumer and other loan portfolio primarily consists of automobile loans, overdrafts, unsecured revolving credit products, personal loans secured by cash and cash equivalents and other similar types of credit facilities. 

Paycheck Protection Program . We have originated loans to qualified small businesses under the PPP administered by the SBA under the provisions of the CARES Act. Loans covered by the PPP may be eligible for loan forgiveness for certain costs incurred related to payroll, group health care benefit costs and qualifying mortgage, rent and utility payments. The remaining loan balance after forgiveness of any amounts is still fully guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to the 2020 Form 10-K for additional details. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, we recognized approximately $38.8 million and $62.3 million, respectively, in PPP loan related deferred processing fees (net of amortization of related deferred origination costs) as yield adjustments and these amounts are included in interest income on loans during this period. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, we recognized approximately $19.3 million in PPP Loan related deferred net processing fees. As a result of the inclusion of these net fees in interest income, the average yield on PPP loans was approximately 6.89% and 5.60% during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the stated interest rate of 1.0% on these loans. The average yield on PPP loans during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was 4.13%. For PPP loans funded through June 30, 2021, we expect to recognize additional PPP loan related deferred processing fees (net of deferred origination costs) totaling approximately $38.0 million as a yield adjustment over the remaining expected lives of these loans. Of this amount, we expect to recognize approximately 72% in 2021 and the remainder in 2022.

Accruing past due loans at June 30, 2021 decreased $5.6 million compared to December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily related to decreases in past due commercial and industrial loans (down $21.3 million) and to a lesser extent past due energy loans (down $11.0 million), past due consumer and other loans (down $3.4 million) and past due consumer real estate loans (down $1.2 million) mostly offset by increases in past due commercial real estate loans (up $29.7 million for non-construction related and $1.7 million for construction). 

Non-Accrual Loans. Non-accrual loans are presented in the tables below. Also see in Note 3 - Loans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Non-accrual loans at June 30, 2021 decreased $4.2 million from December 31, 2020 primarily due to a decrease in non-accrual commercial and industrial loans and non-construction related commercial real estate loans. The decrease in commercial and industrial loans was related to the recognition of charge-offs and, to a lesser extent, principal payments . 

Generally, loans are placed on non-accrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due and/or management deems the collectibility of the principal and/or interest to be in question, as well as when required by regulatory requirements. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations. Subsequent receipts on non-accrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Classification of a loan as non-accrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest. Non-accrual commercial and industrial loans included one credit relationship in excess of $5.0 million totaling $8.4 million at June 30, 2021. This credit relationship was previously reported as non-accrual with an aggregate balance of $9.0 million at December 31, 2020. Non-accrual energy loans included one credit relationship in excess of $5 million totaling $12.6 million at June 30, 2021. This credit relationship was previously reported as non-accrual with an aggregate balance of $20.1 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease in the aggregate balance of this credit relationship was related to principal payments made by the borrower. Non-accrual real estate loans primarily consist of land development, 1-4 family residential construction credit relationships and loans secured by office buildings and religious facilities. There were no non-accrual commercial real estate loans in excess of $5.0 million at June 30, 2021 or December 31, 2020. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

In the case of loans and securities, allowances for credit losses are contra-asset valuation accounts, calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 326 (&#8220;ASC 326&#8221;) Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. See our 2020 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our accounting policies related to credit losses. 

Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans. The table below provides, as of the dates indicated, an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan portfolio segment; however, allocation of a portion of the allowance to one segment does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other segments. 

Amount of Allowance Allocated Percent of Loans in Each Category to Total Loans Total Loans Ratio of Allowance Allocated to Loans in Each Category June 30, 2021 Commercial and industrial $ 65,271 28.7 % $ 4,755,345 1.37 % Energy 28,010 6.2 1,023,202 2.74 Paycheck Protection Program &#8212; 11.6 1,926,824 &#8212; Commercial real estate 147,993 42.5 7,056,046 2.10 Consumer real estate 6,154 8.1 1,351,978 0.46 Consumer and other 7,860 2.9 482,931 1.63 Total $ 255,288 100.0 % $ 16,596,326 1.54 Excluding PPP loans $ 255,288 $ 14,669,502 1.74 December 31, 2020 Commercial and industrial $ 73,843 28.4 % $ 4,955,341 1.49 % Energy 39,553 7.1 1,235,198 3.20 Paycheck Protection Program &#8212; 13.9 2,433,849 &#8212; Commercial real estate 134,892 40.1 7,020,467 1.92 Consumer real estate 7,926 7.6 1,330,774 0.60 Consumer and other 6,963 2.9 505,680 1.38 Total $ 263,177 100.0 % $ 17,481,309 1.51 Excluding PPP loans $ 263,177 $ 15,047,460 1.75 

The allowance allocated to commercial and industrial loans totaled $65.3 million, or 1.37% of total commercial and industrial loans, at June 30, 2021 decreasing $8.6 million, or 11.6%, compared to $73.8 million, or 1.49% of total commercial and industrial loans on December 31, 2020. Modeled expected credit losses decreased $18.4 million while Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments related to commercial and industrial loans increased $10.6 million. Specific allocations for commercial and industrial loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis decreased $828 thousand from $5.3 million at December 31, 2020 to $4.5 million at June 30, 2021. The allowance allocated to energy loans totaled $28.0 million, or 2.74% of total energy loans, at June 30, 2021 decreasing $11.5 million, or 29.2%, compared to $39.6 million, or 3.20% of total energy loans on December 31, 2020. Modeled expected credit losses related to energy loans decreased $1.2 million while Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments related to energy loans decreased $14.8 million. Specific allocations for energy loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis totaled $13.8 million at June 30, 2021 increasing $4.4 million, or 46.5%, compared to $9.4 million on December 31, 2020. The increase in specific allocations for energy loans was primarily related to several newly downgraded credit relationships with specific allocations totaling $8.3 million partly offset by reductions in allocations for certain other loans due to principal payments received and the recognition of charge-offs. The allowance allocated to commercial real estate loans totaled $148.0 million, or 2.10% of total commercial real estate loans, at June 30, 2021 increasing $13.1 million, or 9.7%, compared to $134.9 million, or 1.92% of total commercial real estate loans on December 31, 2020. Modeled expected credit losses related to commercial real estate loans decreased $107.5 million while Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments related to commercial real estate loans increased $120.1 million. Specific allocations for commercial real estate loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis increased from $513 thousand on December 31, 2020 to $950 thousand at June 30, 2021. The allowance allocated to consumer real estate loans totaled $6.2 million, or 0.46% of total consumer real estate loans, at June 30, 2021 decreasing $1.8 million, or 22.4%, compared to $7.9 million, or 0.60% of total consumer real estate loans on December 31, 2020. Modeled expected credit losses related to consumer real estate loans decreased $1.9 million while Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments related to consumer real estate loans increased $61 thousand. The allowance allocated to consumer loans totaled $7.9 million, or 1.63% of total consumer loans, at June 30, 2021 increasing $897 thousand, or 12.9%, compared to $7.0 million, or 1.38% of total consumer loans on December 31, 2020. Modeled expected credit losses related to consumer loans decreased $356 thousand while Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments related to consumer loans increased $1.3 million. 

As more fully described in our 2020 Form 10-K, we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of models which measure probability of default and loss given default, among other things. The measurement of expected credit losses is impacted by loan/borrower attributes and certain macroeconomic variables. Models are adjusted to reflect current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. 

In estimating expected credit losses as of June 30, 2021, we utilized the Moody&#8217;s Analytics June 2021 Consensus Scenario (the &#8220;June 2021 Consensus Scenario&#8221;) to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models. The June 2021 Consensus Scenario was based on the review of a variety of surveys of baseline forecasts of the U.S. economy. The June 2021 Consensus Scenario projections included, among other things, (i) U.S. Gross Domestic Product (&#8220;GDP&#8221;) annualized quarterly growth rates of 8.8% and 6.9% in the third and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively, followed by annualized quarterly growth rates in the range of 3.6% to 5.0% during 2022 and an average annualized growth rate of 4.5% through the end of the forecast period in the second quarter of 2023; (ii) U.S. unemployment rates of 5.0% in the third quarter of 2021 improving to 4.6% by the fourth quarter of 2021 and to 3.9% by the end of the forecast period in the second quarter of 2023 with Texas unemployment rates slightly higher at those dates; and (iii) projected average 10 year Treasury rates of 1.75% and 1.82% in the third and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively, increasing to average projected rates of 2.04% during 2022, and 2.28% by the end of the forecast period in the second quarter of 2023. Furthermore, the June 2021 Consensus Scenario projects an average oil price in the range of approximately $60 to $61 per barrel through the end of the forecast period in the second quarter of 2023. 

In estimating expected credit losses as of December 31, 2020, we utilized the Moody&#8217;s Analytics December 2020 Baseline Scenario (the &#8220;December 2020 Baseline Scenario&#8221;) to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models. The December 2020 Baseline Scenario was based on the review of a variety of surveys of baseline forecasts of the U.S. economy. The December Baseline Scenario projections included, among other things, (i) U.S. GDP annualized quarterly growth rate of 4.6% for the fourth quarter of 2020 followed by projected annualized quarterly growth rates in the range of approximately 3.0% to 8.0% during 2021 and 6.0% to 7.5% through the end of the forecast period in the fourth quarter of 2022; (ii) a U.S. unemployment rate of 6.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and an average projected rate of 7.0% in 2021 and 6.0% in 2022, with the fourth quarter of 2022 projected to be 5.4% (Texas unemployment rates are projected to be slightly less for those periods); and (iii) an average 10 year Treasury rate of 0.79% in the fourth quarter of 2020, increasing to an average projected rate of 1.05% in 2021 and 2.04% in 2022. The December 2020 Baseline Scenario also projected average oil prices of $40 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2020, $45 per barrel on average for the year in 2021 and $55 per barrel on average for the year in 2022, with the fourth quarter of 2022 projected to be $59 per barrel. 

The overall loan portfolio, excluding PPP loans which are fully guaranteed by the SBA, as of June 30, 2021 decreased $378.0 million, or 2.5%, compared to December 31, 2020. This decrease included a $200.0 million, or 4.0%, decrease in commercial and industrial loans, a $212.0 million, or 17.2%, decrease in energy loans and a $22.7 million, or 4.5%, decrease in consumer and other loans partly offset by a $35.6 million, or 0.5%, increase in commercial real estate loans and a $21.2 million, or 1.6%, increase in consumer real estate loans. The weighted average risk grade for commercial and industrial loans decreased to 6.32 at June 30, 2021 compared to 6.45 at December 31, 2020. Commercial and industrial loans graded &#8220;watch&#8221; and &#8220;special mention&#8221; (risk grades 9 and 10) decreased $73.4 million during the first six months of 2021 while classified commercial and industrial loans increased $6.1 million. Classified loans consist of loans having a risk grade of 11, 12 or 13. The weighted-average risk grade for energy loans decreased to 6.73 at June 30, 2021 from 6.85 at December 31, 2020. The decrease in the weighted average risk grade was primarily related to a $104.6 million decrease in energy loans graded &#8220;watch&#8221; and &#8220;special mention&#8221; (risk grades 9 and 10) while pass grade energy loans decreased $108.7 million. Despite these decreases, the weighted-average risk grade of pass grade energy loans increased slightly from 5.99 at December 31, 2020 to 6.03 at June 30, 2021. The weighted average risk grade for commercial real estate loans decreased to 7.26 at June 30, 2021 from 7.32 at December 31, 2020. Pass grade commercial real estate loans increased $64.2 million while commercial real estate loans graded as &#8220;watch&#8221; and &#8220;special mention&#8221; decreased $17.9 million while classified commercial real estate loans decreased $10.7 million. 

As noted above our credit loss models utilized the economic forecasts in the Moody&#8217;s Consensus Scenario for June 2021 for our estimated expected credit losses as of June 30, 2021 and the Moody&#8217;s Baseline Scenario for December 2020 for our estimate of expected credit losses as of December 31, 2020. We qualitatively adjusted the model results based on these scenarios for various risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. These Q-Factor adjustments are discussed below. 

Q-Factor adjustments are based upon management judgment and current assessment as to the impact of risks related to changes in lending policies and procedures; economic and business conditions; loan portfolio attributes and credit concentrations; and external factors, among other things, that are not already captured within the modeling inputs, assumptions and other processes. Management assesses the potential impact of such items within a range of severely negative impact to positive impact and adjusts the modeled expected credit loss by an aggregate adjustment percentage based upon the assessment. As a result of this assessment as of June 30, 2021, modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weighted-average Q-Factor adjustment of approximately 1.1%, down slightly from approximately 1.2% at December 31, 2020. The weighted-average Q-Factor adjustment at June 30, 2021 was based on a neutral expected impact related to changes in lending policies, procedures and underwriting standards; changes in loan portfolio attributes and concentrations, changes in risk grades, changes in the volumes and severity of loan delinquencies and adverse classifications and potential deterioration of collateral values; a negative expected impact associated with national, regional and local economic and business conditions and 

developments that affect the collectability of loans and a severely negative impact from other risk factors associated with our commercial real estate construction and land loan portfolios, particularly the risks related to expected extensions. 

In the first quarter of 2020, unprecedented economic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and oil and gas price volatility resulted in significant spikes in the unemployment rate and the level of unemployment claims as well as severe declines in the level of the U.S. and Texas GDPs, among other things. In some cases, our expected credit loss models consider these economic variables on a three- to four-quarter lag basis. As of June 30, 2021, the significant spikes in several of these variables are no longer impacting our model results; however, as the economy has entered recovery, the models are now being impacted by exceptionally positive changes in certain variables which has resulted in lower estimates of expected credit losses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, management believes there are still significant headwinds impacting the recovery of the U.S. and Texas economies and certain categories of our loan portfolio. As a result, we have provided additional qualitative adjustments for certain categories of loans, as further described below. 

As of June 30, 2021, we provided an additional qualitative adjustment for energy production loans graded "watch" (risk grade 9), "special mention" (risk grade 10) and "substandard-accrual" (risk grade 11). This adjustment was estimated based on borrowing base determinations for our energy production loans using current engineering valuations. We also perform an analysis of our customers' secondary sources of capital. As a result of the estimated borrowing base deficiencies for the identified credits, we provided an additional qualitative adjustment of approximately $5.5 million for energy production loans at June 30, 2021. Using a similar methodology, though for all energy production loans (not limited to certain risk grades), as described in our 2020 Form 10-K, we provided an additional qualitative adjustment for energy production loans of approximately $21.1 million at December 31, 2020. 

We performed a separate assessment of other non-production energy loans which are primarily made up of borrowers associated with oilfield services such as transportation and logistics; equipment manufacturing and other services, among other things. This assessment included a review of customer liquidity and cash flows as well as various debt ratios. Through this review, we were able to identify a small pool of borrowers that management considered to have an elevated level of risk. As a result of this elevated level of risk, management provided an additional qualitative adjustment for other non-production energy loans of approximately $900 thousand at June 30, 2021. No additional qualitative adjustment for non-production energy loans was made as of December 31, 2020. 

Our Commercial Real Estate Oversight Council, in its oversight and assessment of the credit quality of our commercial real estate loan portfolios, believes these portfolios continue to have an elevated level of risk notwithstanding recent economic stimulus efforts by federal and state governments. As of June 30, 2021, we provided additional qualitative adjustments totaling $79.1 million for various categories of our commercial real estate loan portfolio. This amount includes $46.0 million for owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, $21.4 million for non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans and $11.7 million for commercial real estate construction loans. These additional qualitative adjustments are largely related to the on-going effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as further discussed below and, to a lesser extent, to compensate for the effect of the positive changes in certain economic variables used by our credit loss models which has resulted in significantly lower estimates of expected credit losses, beyond a level that management deems appropriate given the significant headwinds management believes are still impacting the recovery of the U.S. and Texas economies and certain categories of our loan portfolio. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout the State of Texas as well as nationally. Efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 led to the closure of non-essential businesses, travel restrictions, supply chain disruptions and prohibitions on public gatherings, among other things, throughout many parts of the United States and, in particular, the markets in which we operate. Nonetheless, by late 2020, the markets in which we operate had substantially reopened. Aside from the energy industry, which is discussed above, we lend to customers operating in certain other industries (detailed in the table below) that have been, and are expected to continue to be, more significantly impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continuing to monitor customers in these industries closely. In assessing these portfolios for an additional qualitative adjustment, we performed a comprehensive review of the financial condition and overall outlook of the borrowers within these portfolios. Based on this analysis, we determined that there continues to be an elevated level of risk associated with these industries. As a result, we provided an additional qualitative adjustment related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic totaling $56.2 million as of June 30, 2021, of which $50.0 million was allocated to commercial real estate loans and $6.2 million was allocated to commercial and industrial loans. These amounts are included in the totals detailed above. As of December 31, 2020, we provided a similar additional qualitative adjustment totaling $47.1 million, the details of which are described in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

These industries that management believes are particularly impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are presented in the following table as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and include amounts reported as both commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans while PPP loans are excluded. 

Outstanding Balance Percentage of Total Loans, Excluding PPP Loans Allocated Allowance Allocated Allowance as a Percentage of Outstanding Balance June 30, 2021 Hotels/lodging $ 286,746 1.95 % $ 27,090 9.45 % Restaurants 271,691 1.85 19,448 7.16 Entertainment 116,648 0.80 11,462 9.83 Total $ 675,085 4.60 % $ 58,000 8.59 % December 31, 2020 Retail/strip centers $ 916,633 6.09 % $ 21,049 2.30 % Hotels/lodging 268,825 1.79 24,546 9.13 Restaurants 277,054 1.84 20,617 7.44 Entertainment 126,266 0.84 6,151 4.87 Total $ 1,588,778 10.56 % $ 72,363 4.55 % 

As of June 30, 2021, we provided an additional qualitative adjustment for our commercial and industrial loan portfolio totaling $13.0 million, of which $6.2 million was included in the $56.2 million additional qualitative adjustment for COVID-19 impacted industries discussed above. An additional $6.8 million was provided based upon management's assessment of the risk associated with the long-term sustainability of borrowers within our small business commercial and industrial portfolio. The majority of these borrowers have been bolstered by PPP funding from the SBA which has helped them to sustain their operations amid on-going pandemic-related shutdowns and other restrictions. Nonetheless, management believes there is a significant amount of uncertainty associated with the long-term viability of many of these businesses when this government supplemented funding runs out. Furthermore, on March 27, 2021, the COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension Act of 2021 was enacted, extending the bankruptcy relief provisions enacted in the CARES Act of 2020 until March 27, 2022. These provisions provide financially distressed small businesses and individuals greater access to bankruptcy relief. In that regard, we also provided an additional qualitative adjustment for our consumer and other loan portfolio totaling $1.3 million in light of the level of unsecured loans within this portfolio. 

Additional information related to credit loss expense and net (charge-offs) recoveries is presented in the table below. Also see Note 3 - Loans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

We recorded a net credit loss benefit related to loans totaling $4.4 million for the both three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to net credit loss expense related to loans totaled $27.2 million and $200.2 million for the same periods in 2020. The net credit loss benefit related to loans during the first six months of 2021 primarily reflects improvements in forecasted economic conditions and oil price trends relative to the prevailing conditions in 2020. Credit loss expense related to loans during the first six months of 2020 reflected the uncertain future impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant volatility in oil prices. Credit loss expense during the first six months of 2020 also reflected the level of net charge-offs, the expected deterioration in credit quality and other changes within the loan portfolio. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was 1.54% (1.74% excluding PPP loans) at June 30, 2021 compared to 1.51% (1.75% excluding PPP loans) at December 31, 2020. Management believes the recorded amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans is appropriate based upon management&#8217;s best estimate of current expected credit losses within the existing portfolio of 

loans. Should any of the factors considered by management in making this estimate change, our estimate of current expect credit losses could also change, which could affect the level of future credit loss expense related to loans. 

Allowance for Credit Losses - Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures totaled approximately $48.6 million and $44.2 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The level of the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures depends upon the volume of outstanding commitments, underlying risk grades, the expected utilization of available funds and forecasted economic conditions impacting our loan portfolio. Our policies and methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures are further described in our 2020 Form 10-K. Credit loss expense related to off-balance-sheet credit exposures totaled $4.4 million during the first six months of 2021 compared to $7.1 million during the same period in 2020. 

Capital and Liquidity 

Capital . Shareholders&#8217; equity totaled $4.4 billion and $4.3 billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. In addition to net income of $234.1 million, other sources of capital during the six months ended June 30, 2021 included $36.7 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and $5.8 million related to stock-based compensation. Additionally, we issued $1.7 million of common stock held in treasury to our 401(k) plan in connection with matching contributions. Uses of capital during the six months ended June 30, 2021 included other comprehensive loss, net of tax, of $100.0 million; $96.2 million of dividends paid on preferred and common stock; and $1.3 million of treasury stock purchases. 

The accumulated other comprehensive income/loss component of shareholders&#8217; equity totaled a net, after-tax, unrealized gain of $413.0 million at June 30, 2021 compared to $513.0 million at December 31, 2020. The change was primarily due to a $102.0 million net, after-tax, decrease in the net unrealized gain on securities available for sale. 

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, we have elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital. Accordingly, amounts reported as accumulated other comprehensive income/loss do not increase or reduce regulatory capital and are not included in the calculation of our regulatory capital ratios. In connection with the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, we also elected to exclude, for a transitional period, the effects of credit loss accounting under CECL in the calculation of our regulatory capital and regulatory capital ratios. Regulatory agencies for banks and bank holding companies utilize capital guidelines designed to measure capital and take into consideration the risk inherent in both on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet items. See Note 7 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 

We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.72 during each of the first and second quarters of 2021 and a quarterly dividend of $0.71 per common share during each the first and second quarters of 2020. These dividend amounts equate to a common stock dividend payout ratio of 40.1% and 64.0% during the first six months of 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our capital stock may be impacted by certain restrictions described in Note 7 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 

Preferred Stock. On March 16, 2020, we redeemed all 6,000,000 shares of our 5.375% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, (&#8220;Series A Preferred Stock&#8221;) at a redemption price of $25 per share, or an aggregate redemption of $150.0 million. When issued, the net proceeds of the Series A Preferred Stock totaled $144.5 million after deducting $5.5 million of issuance costs including the underwriting discount and professional service fees, among other things. Upon redemption, these issuance costs were reclassified to retained earnings and reported as a reduction of net income available to common shareholders. 

On November 19, 2020 we issued 150,000 shares, or $150.0 million in aggregate liquidation preference, of our 4.450% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, par value $0.01 and liquidation preference $1,000 per share (&#8220;Series B Preferred Stock&#8221;). Each share of Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding is represented by 40 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of the Series B Preferred Stock (equivalent to a liquidation preference of $25 per share). Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, if declared, accrue and are payable quarterly, in arrears, at a rate of 4.450% per annum. The net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the depositary shares representing the Series B Preferred Stock, after deducting underwriting discount and commissions, and the payment of expenses, were approximately $145.5 million. Under the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, in the event that we do not declare and pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for the most recent dividend period, we may not, with certain exceptions, declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock or any of our securities that rank junior to the Series B Preferred Stock. See Note 7 &#8211; Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 

Stock Repurchase Plans. From time to time, our board of directors has authorized stock repurchase plans. In general, stock repurchase plans allow us to proactively manage our capital position and return excess capital to shareholders. Shares purchased under such plans also provide us with shares of common stock necessary to satisfy obligations related to stock compensation awards. On January 27, 2021 our board of directors authorized a $100.0 million stock repurchase program, allowing us to repurchase shares of our common stock over a one-year period from time to time at various prices in the open market or through private transactions. No shares were repurchased under this plan during the first six months of 2021. Under a prior plan, we repurchased 177,834 shares at a total cost of $13.7 million during 2020. See Note 7 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and Part II, Item 2 - Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds, each included elsewhere in this report. 

Liquidity . As more fully discussed in our 2020 Form 10-K, our liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Liquidity risk management is an important element in our asset/liability management process. We regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions, volatility in the financial markets, unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management. These scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan, which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs. Our principal source of funding has been our customer deposits, supplemented by our short-term and long-term borrowings as well as maturities of securities and loan amortization. As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately $14.5 billion held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve. We also have the ability to borrow funds as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;). As of June 30, 2021, based upon available, pledgeable collateral, our total borrowing capacity with the FHLB was approximately $4.4 billion. Furthermore, at June 30, 2021, we had approximately $7.6 billion in securities that were unencumbered by a pledge and could be used to support additional borrowings through repurchase agreements or the Federal Reserve discount window, as needed. 

Since Cullen/Frost is a holding company and does not conduct operations, its primary sources of liquidity are dividends upstreamed from Frost Bank and borrowings from outside sources. Banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by Frost Bank. See Note 7 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report regarding such dividends. At June 30, 2021, Cullen/Frost had liquid assets, including cash and resell agreements, totaling $426.2 million.
