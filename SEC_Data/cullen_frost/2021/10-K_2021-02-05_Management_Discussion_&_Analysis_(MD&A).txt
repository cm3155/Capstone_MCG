Recent Developments Related to COVID-19 

Overview. Our business has been, and continues to be, impacted by the recent and ongoing outbreak of COVID-19. In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the President of the United States. Efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 have included shelter-in-place orders, the closure of non-essential businesses, travel restrictions, supply chain disruptions and prohibitions on public gatherings, among other things, throughout many parts of the United States and, in particular, the markets in which we operate. As the current pandemic is ongoing and dynamic in nature, there are many uncertainties related to COVID-19 including, among other things, its severity; the duration of the outbreak; the impact to our customers, employees and vendors; the impact to the financial services and banking industry; and the impact to the economy as a whole as well as the effect of actions taken, or that may yet be taken, or inaction by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or to mitigate its impact (both economic and health-related). COVID-19 has negatively affected, and is expected to continue to negatively affect, our business, financial position and operating results. In light of the uncertainties and continuing developments discussed herein, the ultimate adverse impact of COVID-19 cannot be reliably estimated at this time, but it has been and is expected to continue to be material. 

Impact on our Operations. In the State of Texas, many jurisdictions declared health emergencies. The resulting closures and/or limited operations of non-essential businesses and related economic disruption have impacted our operations as well as the operations of our customers. Financial services have been identified as a Critical Infrastructure Sector by the Department of Homeland Security. Accordingly, our business remains open. To address the issues arising as a result of COVID-19, and in order to facilitate the continued delivery of essential services while maintaining a high level of safety for our customers as well as our employees, we have implemented our Business Continuity and Health Emergency Response plans. Among other things, significant actions taken under these plans include: 

&#8226; Implemented our communications plans to ensure our employees, customers and critical vendors are kept abreast of developments affecting our operations. 

&#8226; Restricted all non-essential travel and large external gatherings and have instituted a mandatory quarantine period for anyone that has traveled to an impacted area. 

&#8226; After temporarily closing all of our financial center lobbies and other corporate facilities to non-employees, except for certain limited cases by appointment only, we have reopened our financial center lobbies. 

&#8226; Expanded remote-access availability so that nearly all of our workforce has the capability to work from home or other remote locations. All activities are performed in accordance with our compliance and information security policies designed to ensure customer data and other information is properly safeguarded. 

&#8226; Instituted mandatory social distancing policies for those employees not working remotely. Members of certain operations teams have been split into separate buildings or locations to create redundancy for key functions across the organization. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing actions, the COVID-19 outbreak could still, among other things, greatly affect our routine and essential operations due to staff absenteeism, particularly among key personnel; further limit access to or result in further closures of our branch facilities and other physical offices; exacerbate operational, technical or security-related risks arising from a remote workforce; and result in adverse government or regulatory agency orders. The business and operations of our third-party service providers, many of whom perform critical services for our business, could also be significantly impacted, which in turn could impact us. As a result, we are currently unable to fully assess or predict the extent of the effects of COVID-19 on our operations as the ultimate impact will depend on factors that are currently unknown and/or beyond our control. 

Impact on our Financial Position and Results of Operations. Our financial position and results of operations are particularly susceptible to the ability of our loan customers to meet loan obligations, the availability of our workforce, the availability of our vendors and the decline in the value of assets held by us. While its effects continue to materialize, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout the State of Texas as well as nationally. This decrease in commercial activity has caused and may continue to cause our customers (including affected businesses and individuals), vendors and counterparties to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to us. The national public health crisis arising from the COVID-19 pandemic (and public expectations about it), combined with certain pre-existing factors, including, but not limited to, international trade disputes, inflation risks and oil price volatility, could further destabilize the financial markets and geographies in which we operate. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding the sustainability of any economic improvements has impacted the creditworthiness of potential and current borrowers. Borrower loan defaults that adversely affect our earnings correlate with deteriorating economic conditions (such as the unemployment rate), which, in turn, are likely to impact our borrowers' creditworthiness and our ability to make loans. See further information related to the risk exposure of our loan portfolio under the sections captioned &#8220;Loans&#8221; and &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion. 

In addition, the economic pressures and uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in and may continue to result in specific changes in consumer and business spending and borrowing and saving habits, affecting the demand for loans and other products and services we offer. Consumers affected by COVID-19 may continue to demonstrate changed behavior even after the crisis is over. For example, consumers may decrease discretionary spending on a permanent or long-term basis and certain industries may take longer to recover (particularly those that rely on travel or large gatherings) as consumers may be hesitant to return to full social interaction. We lend to customers operating in such industries including energy, retail/strip centers, hotels/lodging, restaurants, entertainment and commercial real estate, among others, that have been significantly impacted by COVID-19 and we are continuing to monitor these customers closely. To help mitigate the adverse effects of COVID-19, loan customers may apply for a deferral of payments, or portions thereof, for up to 90 days. After 90 days, customers may apply for an additional deferral. Additionally, the temporary closures of bank branches and the safety precautions implemented at re-opened branches could result in consumers becoming more comfortable with technology and devaluing face-to-face interaction. Our business is relationship driven and such changes could necessitate changes to our business practices to accommodate changing consumer behaviors. The potential changes in behaviors driven by COVID-19 also present heightened liquidity risks, for example, arising from increased demand for our products and services (such as unusually high draws on credit facilities) or decreased demand for our products and services (such as idiosyncratic, or broad-based, market or other developments that lead to deposit outflows). 

Legislative and Regulatory Developments. Recent actions taken by the federal government and the Federal Reserve and other bank regulatory agencies to mitigate the economic effects of COVID-19 will also have an impact on our financial position and results of operations. These actions are further discussed below. 

In an emergency measure aimed at blunting the economic impact of COVID-19, the Federal Reserve lowered the target for the federal funds rate to a range of between zero to 0.25% effective on March 16, 2020. This action by the Federal Reserve followed a prior reduction of the targeted federal funds rates to a range of 1.0% to 1.25% effective on March 4, 2020. Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. As our balance sheet is more asset sensitive, our earnings are more adversely affected by decreases in market interest rates as the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly and to a larger degree than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. The decline in interest rates has already led to new all-time low yields across the US Treasury maturity curve. In September 2020, the Federal Reserve indicated that it expects to maintain the targeted 

federal funds rate at current levels until such time that labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2% and is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time. This timeframe is currently expected to last through 2023. Nonetheless, if the Federal Reserve decreases the targeted federal funds rates even further in response to the economic effects of COVID-19, overall interest rates will decline further, which will negatively impact our net interest income and further compress our net interest margin. 

Other actions taken by the Federal Reserve in an effort to provide monetary stimulus to counteract the economic disruption caused by COVID-19 include: 

&#8226; Expanded reverse repo operations, adding liquidity to the banking system. 

&#8226; Restarted quantitative easing. 

&#8226; Lowered the interest rate on the discount window by 1.5% to 0.25%. 

&#8226; Reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent. 

&#8226; Encouraged banks to use their capital and liquidity buffers to lend. 

&#8226; Introduced and expanded several new programs that will operate on a temporary basis to help preserve market liquidity. 

The U.S. government has also enacted certain fiscal stimulus measures in several phases to counteract the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19. The Phase 1 legislation, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, was enacted on March 6, 2020 and, among other things, authorized funding for research and development of vaccines and allocated money to state and local governments to aid containment and response measures. The Phase 2 legislation, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, was enacted on March 18, 2020 and provides for paid sick/medical leave, establishes no-cost coverage for coronavirus testing, expands unemployment benefits, expands food assistance, and provides additional funding to states for the ongoing economic consequences of the pandemic, among other provisions. The Phase 3 legislation, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;), was enacted on March 27, 2020. Among other provisions, the CARES Act (i) authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to make loans, loan guarantees and other investments, up to $500 billion, for assistance to eligible businesses, States and municipalities with limited, targeted relief for passenger air carriers, cargo air carriers, and businesses critical to maintaining national security, (ii) created a $349 billion loan program called the Paycheck Protection Program (the &#8220;PPP&#8221;) for loans to small businesses for, among other things, payroll, group health care benefit costs and qualifying mortgage, rent and utility payments, (iii) provided certain credits against the 2020 personal income tax for eligible individuals and their dependents, (iv) expanded eligibility for unemployment insurance and provides eligible recipients with an additional $600 per week on top of the unemployment amount determined by each State and (v) expanded tele-health services in Medicare. The Phase 3.5 legislation, the Paycheck Protection Program and Healthcare Enhancement Act of 2020 (the &#8220;PPPHE Act&#8221;), was enacted on April 24, 2020. Among other things, the PPPHE Act provided an additional $310 billion of funding for the PPP of which, $30 billion is specifically allocated for use by banks and other insured depository institutions that have assets between $10 billion and $50 billion. 

The Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020&#8221; (the &#8220;PPPF Act&#8221;) was enacted in June 2020 and modified the PPP as follows: (i) established a minimum maturity of five years for all loans made after the enactment of the PPPF Act and permits an extension of the maturity of existing loans to five years if the borrower and lender agree; (ii) extended the &#8220;covered period&#8221; of the CARES Act from June 30, 2020, to December 31, 2020; (iii) extended the eight-week &#8220;covered period&#8221; for expenditures that qualify for forgiveness to the earlier of 24 weeks following loan origination or December 31, 2020; (iv) extended the deferral period for payment of principal, interest and fees to the date on which the forgiveness amount is remitted to the lender by the SBA; (v) changed requirements such that the borrower must use at least 60% (down from 75%) of the proceeds of the loan for payroll costs, and up to 40% (up from 25%), for other permitted purposes, as a condition to obtaining forgiveness of the loan; (vi) delayed from June 30, 2020 to December 31, 2020 the date by which employees must be rehired to avoid a reduction in the amount of forgiveness of a loan, and creates a &#8220;rehiring safe harbor&#8221; that allows businesses to remain eligible for loan forgiveness if they make a good-faith attempt to rehire employees or hire similarly qualified employees, but are unable to do so, or are able to document an inability to return to pre-COVID-19 levels of business activity due to compliance with social distancing measures; and (vii) allows borrowers to receive both loan forgiveness under the PPP and the payroll tax deferral permitted under the CARES Act, rather than having to choose which of the two would be more advantageous. 

In July 2020, the CARES Act was amended to extend, through August 8, 2020, the SBA&#8217;s authority to make commitments under the PPP. The SBA&#8217;s existing authority had previously expired on June 30, 2020. In August 2020, President Trump signed four executive actions to provide additional COVID-19 relief. The first action authorized the Lost Wages Assistance Program ( &#8220;LWAP&#8221; ), which provides for a $400-per-week payment to those currently receiving more than $100 a week in unemployment benefits due to disruptions caused by COVID-19. The LWAP per-week payment is retroactive to the week ending August 1, 2020. The second executive action extended the moratorium on payments and interest accrual on student loans held by the government until the end of 2020. The moratorium was previously set to expire September 30, 2020. The third action instructed the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to help provide temporary assistance to renters and homeowners and promote their ability to avoid eviction or foreclosure. The fourth executive action allows employers to defer, for the period from September 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, the employee portion of Social Security payroll taxes for certain individuals earning less than approximately $104 thousand per year. 

In December 2020, the Bipartisan-Bicameral Omnibus COVID Relief Deal, included as a component of appropriations legislation, was enacted to provide economic stimulus to individuals and businesses in further response to the economic distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other things, the legislation includes (i) payments of $600 for individuals making up to $75,000 per year, (ii) extension of the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program to include a $300 weekly enhancement in unemployment benefits beginning after December 26, 2020 up to March 14, 2021, (iii) a temporary and targeted rental assistance program, and extends the eviction moratorium through January 31, 2021, (iv) targeted funding related to transportation, education, agriculture, nutrition and other public health measures and (v) approximately $325 billion for small business relief, including approximately $284 billion for a second round of PPP loans and a new simplified forgiveness procedure for PPP loans of $150,000 or less. We are continuing to monitor the potential development of additional legislation and further actions taken by the U.S. government. 

The Federal Reserve created various additional lending facilities and expanded existing facilities to help provide financing in response to the financial disruptions caused by COVID-19. The programs include, among others, the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (the &#8220;PPP Facility&#8221;), which is intended to extend loans to banks making PPP loans. The Federal Reserve announced extensions through March 31, 2021 for several of its lending facilities, including the PPP Facility, that were generally scheduled to expire on or around December 31, 2020. As more fully discussed in the section captioned &#8220;Loans&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion, we are currently participating in the PPP as a lender. We have not participated in the PPP Facility. 

Banks and bank holding companies have been particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of disruption and volatility in the global capital markets. This disruption has impacted our cost of capital and may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets if we need or desire to do so and, although the ultimate impact cannot be reliably estimated at this time in light of the uncertainties and ongoing developments noted herein, such impacts could be material. Furthermore, bank regulatory agencies have been (and are expected to continue to be) very proactive in responding to both market and supervisory concerns arising from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the potential impact on customers, especially borrowers. As shown during and following the financial crisis of 2007-2008, periods of economic and financial disruption and stress have, in the past, resulted in increased scrutiny of banking organizations. We are closely monitoring the potential for new laws and regulations impacting lending and funding practices as well as capital and liquidity standards. Such changes could require us to maintain significantly more capital, with common equity as a more predominant component, or manage the composition of our assets and liabilities to comply with formulaic liquidity requirements. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates 

We follow accounting and reporting policies that conform, in all material respects, to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and to general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

We consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the 

accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial statements. 

Accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and off-balance-sheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management. As discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, our policies related to allowances for credit losses changed on January 1, 2020 in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard update as codified in Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 326 (&#8220;ASC 326&#8221;) Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. In the case of loans, the allowance for credit losses is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. See the section captioned &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion as well as Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 - Loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data elsewhere in this report for further details of the risk factors considered by management in estimating the necessary level of the allowance for credit losses. 

Overview 

The following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors that affected our financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and results of operations for each of the years then ended. Refer to Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 4, 2020 (the &#8220; 2019 F orm 10-K &#8221;) for a discussion and analysis of the more significant factors that affected periods prior to 2019. 

Certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. From time to time, we have acquired various small businesses through our insurance subsidiary. None of these acquisitions had a significant impact on our financial statements. We account for acquisitions using the acquisition method, and as such, the results of operations of acquired companies are included from the date of acquisition. 

Taxable-equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from tax-free loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable, thus making tax-exempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields. Taxable equivalent adjustments were based upon a 21% income tax rate. 

Dollar amounts in tables are stated in thousands, except for per share amounts. 

Results of Operations 

Net income available to common shareholders totaled $323.6 million, or $5.10 diluted per common share, in 2020 compared to $435.5 million, or $6.84 diluted per common share, in 2019 and $446.9 million, or $6.90 diluted per common share, in 2018. 

Selected income statement data, returns on average assets and average equity and dividends per share for the comparable periods were as follows: 

##TABLE_START 2020 2019 2018 Taxable-equivalent net interest income $ 1,070,937 $ 1,100,586 $ 1,052,564 Taxable-equivalent adjustment 94,936 96,581 94,672 Net interest income 976,001 1,004,005 957,892 Credit loss expense 241,230 33,759 21,685 Non-interest income 465,454 363,902 351,286 Non-interest expense 848,904 834,679 778,812 Income before income taxes 351,321 499,469 508,681 Income tax expense 20,170 55,870 53,763 Net income 331,151 443,599 454,918 Preferred stock dividends 2,016 8,063 8,063 Redemption of preferred stock 5,514 &#8212; &#8212; Net income available to common shareholders $ 323,621 $ 435,536 $ 446,855 Earnings per common share - basic $ 5.11 $ 6.89 $ 6.97 Earnings per common share - diluted 5.10 6.84 6.90 Dividends per common share 2.85 2.80 2.58 Return on average assets 0.85 % 1.36 % 1.44 % Return on average common equity 8.11 12.24 14.23 Average shareholders' equity to average assets 10.64 11.54 10.58 ##TABLE_END

Net income available to common shareholders decreased $111.9 million for 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily the result of a $207.5 million increase in credit loss expense, a $28.0 million decrease in net interest income and a $14.2 million increase in non-interest expense partly offset by a $101.6 million increase in non-interest income and a $35.7 million decrease in income tax expense. The increase in credit loss expense during 2020 resulted from both our adoption of a new credit loss accounting standard and the adverse events impacting our loan portfolio, including those arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant volatility in oil prices. The increase in non-interest income during 2020 was primarily related to a $109.0 million net gain on securities transactions. Net income available to common shareholders for 2020 was also impacted by the reclassification of $5.5 million of issuance costs associated with our Series A Preferred Stock to retained earnings upon redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock in the first quarter. 

Details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is our largest source of revenue, representing 67.7% of total revenue during 2020. Excluding the revenue associated with the $109.0 million net gain on securities transactions realized during 2020, net interest income would have represented 73.2% of total revenue during 2020. Net interest margin is the ratio of taxable-equivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin. 

The Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. Our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate. The prime rate began 2018 at 4.50% and increased 100 basis points (25 basis points in each of March, June, September and December) to end the year at 5.50%. During 2019, the prime rate decreased 50 basis points during the third quarter of 2019 (25 basis points in each of August and September) and 25 basis points in October 2019 to end the year at 4.75%. During 2020, the prime rate decreased 150 basis points in March to 3.25% where it remained through 

December 31, 2020. Our loan portfolio is also significantly impacted, by changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). At December 31, 2020, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates were 0.14% and 0.24%, respectively, while at December 31, 2019, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates were 1.76% and 1.90% respectively, and at December 31, 2018, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates were 2.50% and 2.81% respectively. The target range for the federal funds rate, which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds, began 2018 at 1.25% to 1.50% and increased 100 basis points (25 basis points in each of March, June, September and December) to end the year at 2.25% to 2.50%. During 2019, the target range for the federal funds rate decreased 50 basis points during the third quarter of 2019 (25 basis points in each of August and September) and 25 basis points in October 2019 to end the year at 1.50% to 1.75%. During 2020, the target range for the federal funds rate decreased 150 basis points in March to zero to 0.25% where it remained through December 31, 2020. As noted in the section captioned &#8220;Recent Developments Related to COVID-19&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion, the decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate in March 2020 was largely an emergency measure by the Federal Reserve aimed at blunting the economic impact of COVID-19. 

We are primarily funded by core deposits, with non-interest-bearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds. This lower-cost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment. Though federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits were repealed in 2011, we have not experienced any significant additional interest costs as a result. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk elsewhere in this report for information about our sensitivity to interest rates. Further analysis of the components of our net interest margin is presented below. 

The following table presents the changes in taxable-equivalent net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities. The changes in net interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average interest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each. The comparison between 2020 and 2019 includes an additional change factor that shows the effect of the difference in the number of days (due to leap year) in each period for assets and liabilities that accrue interest based upon the actual number of days in the period, as further discussed below. Our consolidated average balance sheets along with an analysis of taxable-equivalent net interest income are presented in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income for 2020 decreased $29.6 million, or 2.7%, compared to 2019. Taxable-equivalent net interest income 2020 included 366 days compared to 365 days for 2019 as a result of the leap year. The additional day added approximately $1.8 million to taxable-equivalent net interest income during 2020. Excluding the impact of the additional day results in an effective decrease in taxable-equivalent net interest income of approximately $31.5 million during 2020. The taxable-equivalent net interest margin decreased 66 basis points from 3.75% during 2019 to 3.09% during 2020. 

The decreases in taxable-equivalent net interest income and taxable-equivalent net interest margin during 2020 were primarily related to decreases in the average yields on loans and interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) combined with, to a significantly lesser extent, decreases in the average volume of taxable securities (based on amortized cost) and increases in the average volume of interest-bearing deposit liabilities. The impact of these items was partly offset by increases in the average volumes of loans and interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) combined with decreases in the average cost of interest-bearing deposit liabilities and other borrowed funds. 

The average volume of interest-earning assets for 2020 increased $5.6 billion, or 19.1%, compared to 2019. The increase in earning assets included a $3.7 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve), a $2.7 billion increase in average loans (of which approximately $2.2 billion related to PPP loans, as further discussed below) and a $198.2 million increase in average tax-exempt securities partly offset by an $814.2 million decrease in average taxable securities and a $145.9 million decrease in average federal funds sold and resell agreements. 

The average yield on interest-earning assets decreased 98 basis points from 4.20% during 2019 to 3.22% during 2020 and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 51 basis points from 0.74% in 2019 to 0.23% in 2020. The average taxable-equivalent yields on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities were primarily impacted by the aforementioned changes in market interest rates and changes in the volume and relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

The average taxable-equivalent yield on loans decreased 118 basis points from 5.17% during 2019 to 3.99% during 2020. The average taxable-equivalent yield on loans was negatively impacted by lower average market interest rates in 2020 compared to 2019. The average volume of loans increased $2.7 billion, or 18.9%, in 2020 compared to 2019. Loans made up approximately 48.7% of average interest-earning assets during 2020 compared to 48.8% during 2019. As discussed in the section captioned &#8220;Loans&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion, in April 2020, we began originating loans to qualified small businesses under the PPP administered by the SBA under the provisions of the CARES Act. Through December 31, 2020, we have funded approximately $3.3 billion of SBA-approved PPP loans. During 2020, we recognized $59.5 million in PPP loan related deferred processing fees (net of amortization of related deferred origination costs) as a yield adjustment and this amount is included in interest income on loans. As a result of the inclusion of these net fees in interest income, the average yield on PPP loans was approximately 3.78% during 2020 compared to the stated interest rate of 1.0% on these loans. As of December 31, 2020, we expect to recognize additional PPP loan related deferred processing fees (net of deferred origination costs) totaling approximately $39.5 million as a yield adjustment over the remaining terms of these loans, most of which is expected to be recognized in 2021. 

The average taxable-equivalent yield on securities was 3.46% during 2020, increasing 6 basis points compared to 3.40% during 2019. The average taxable-equivalent yield on securities during 2020 was positively impacted by an increase in the relative proportion of higher-yielding tax-exempt securities to total securities. The average yield on taxable securities was 2.27% during 2020 compared to 2.33% during 2019, decreasing 6 basis points, while the average yield on tax exempt securities was 4.08% during 2020 compared to 4.06% during 2019, increasing 2 basis points. Tax exempt securities made up approximately 66.6% of total average securities during 2020, compared to 62.0% during 2019. The average volume of total securities decreased $616.0 million, or 4.6%, during 2020 compared to 2019. Securities made up approximately 36.0% of average interest-earning assets in 2020 compared to 44.9% in 2019. The decrease was partly related to the impact of PPP loans and increased interest-bearing deposits on total average interest-earning assets. 

Average interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve), during 2020 increased $3.7 billion, or 228.0%, compared to 2019. Interest-bearing deposits made up approximately 15.0% of average interest-earning assets during 2020 compared to approximately 5.5% in 2019. The increase in the average volume of interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) was primarily due to increases in the average volume of deposits. The average yield on interest-bearing deposits was 0.24% during 2020 and 2.20% during 2019. The average yield on interest-bearing deposits was negatively impacted by lower interest rates paid on excess reserves held at the Federal Reserve during 2020 compared to 2019. 

Average federal funds sold and resell agreements during 2020 decreased $145.9 million, or 59.4%,compared to 2019. Federal funds sold and resell agreements were not a significant component of interest-earning assets during the comparable periods. The average yield on federal funds sold and resell agreements was 0.90% during 2020 compared to 2.25% during 2019. The average yields on federal funds sold and resell agreements were negatively impacted by lower average market interest rates during 2020 compared to 2019. 

The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.23% during 2020, decreasing 51 basis points from 0.74% during 2019. Average deposits increased $5.0 billion, or 19.0%, in 2020 compared to 2019. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $1.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, while average non-interest-bearing deposits increased $3.2 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The ratio of average interest-bearing deposits to total average deposits was 56.9% in 2020 compared to 60.8% in 2019. The average cost of deposits is primarily impacted by changes in market interest rates as well as changes in the volume and relative mix of interest-bearing deposits. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits and total deposits was 0.18% and 0.10% in 2020 compared to 0.62% and 0.38% in 2019. The average cost of deposits during 2020 was impacted by decreases in the interest rates we pay on most of our interest-bearing deposit products as a result of the aforementioned decreases in market interest rates. 

In April 2020, we borrowed an aggregate $1.3 billion from the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) to provide additional liquidity in light of economic uncertainty and our significant PPP lending volume. These advances were subsequently paid-off in May 2020 as we determined additional liquidity resources were not necessary. 

Our taxable-equivalent net interest spread, which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 2.99% in 2020 compared to 3.46% in 2019. The net interest spread, as well as the net interest margin, will be impacted by future changes in short-term and long-term interest rate levels, as well as the impact from the competitive environment. A discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk elsewhere in this report. 

Our hedging policies permit the use of various derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, swaptions, caps and floors, to manage exposure to changes in interest rates. Details of our derivatives and hedging activities are set forth in Note 15 - Derivative Financial Instruments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. Information regarding the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our derivative financial instruments is set forth in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk elsewhere in this report. 

Our net interest income and net interest margin have been, and we currently expect them to continue to be, impacted by the aforementioned decreases in market interest rates and the expectation that interest rates will remain at these low levels for some period of time in light of the on-going economic disruption arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our participation in the PPP, as discussed above, is expected to continue to positively impact net interest income and net interest margin in the near term. 

Credit Loss Expense 

Credit loss expense is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit loss accounts for various types of financial instruments including loans, securities and off-balance-sheet credit exposure after net charge-offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level which, in management&#8217;s best estimate, is necessary to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments. 

The components of credit loss expense were as follows. 

##TABLE_START 2020 2019 2018 Credit loss expense related to: Loans $ 237,010 $ 33,759 $ 21,613 Off-balance-sheet credit exposures 4,275 &#8212; 72 Securities held to maturity (55) &#8212; &#8212; Total $ 241,230 $ 33,759 $ 21,685 ##TABLE_END

Credit loss expense in 2019 and 2018 was calculated under the prior incurred loss accounting methodology. Furthermore, credit loss expense related to off-balance-sheet credit exposures was previously reported as a component of other non-interest expense. Such amounts have been reclassified to credit loss expense to make prior periods comparable to the current presentation. See the section captioned &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of credit loss expense related to loans and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. 

Non-Interest Income 

The components of non-interest income were as follows: 

##TABLE_START 2020 2019 2018 Trust and investment management fees $ 129,272 $ 126,722 $ 119,391 Service charges on deposit accounts 80,873 88,983 85,186 Insurance commissions and fees 50,313 52,345 48,967 Interchange and debit card transaction fees 13,470 14,873 13,877 Other charges, commissions and fees 34,825 37,123 37,231 Net gain (loss) on securities transactions 108,989 293 (156) Other 47,712 43,563 46,790 Total $ 465,454 $ 363,902 $ 351,286 ##TABLE_END

Total non-interest income for 2020 increased $101.6 million, or 27.9%, compared to 2019. Excluding $109.0 million and $293 thousand in net gains on securities transactions during 2020 and 2019, respectively, total non-interest income decreased $7.1 million, or 2.0%, during 2020. Changes in the various components of non-interest income are discussed in more detail below. 

Trust and Investment Management Fees. Trust and investment management fee income for 2020 increased $2.6 million, or 2.0%, compared to 2019. Investment management fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees, making up approximately 84% and 82% of total trust and investment management fees in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in trust and investment management fees during 2020 was primarily due to increases in investment management fees (up $3.8 million), custody fees (up $770 thousand) and real estate fees (up $478 thousand) partly offset by a decrease in oil and gas fees (down $2.4 million). Investment management fees and other custodial account fees are generally based on the market value of assets within an account. The increase in investment management fees was related to an increase in the number of accounts as well as higher average equity valuations. The fluctuations in real estate fees and custody fees were primarily related to variation in transaction volume. Oil and gas fees during 2020 were impacted by the sharp decline in oil prices in March 2020. Though the $48 price per barrel of oil as of December 31, 2020 has rebounded from recent lows, it still remains significantly lower than the $61 price per barrel as of December 31, 2019. Volatility in the equity and bond markets impacts the market value of trust assets and the related investment management fees and other custodial account fees. Investor concerns related to the uncertain economic outlook arising from the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant market volatility resulting in significant declines in market valuations, particularly among equity securities, during the latter part of the first quarter of 2020 and the early part of the second quarter of 2020. Market valuations as of December 31, 2020 have rebounded significantly from the recent declines. Increased market valuations are expected to have a positive impact on trust investment management fees and other custodial account fees. 

At December 31, 2020, trust assets, including both managed assets and custody assets, were primarily composed of equity securities (52.1% of trust assets), fixed income securities (32.7% of trust assets) and cash equivalents (9.9% of trust assets). The estimated fair value of trust assets was $38.6 billion (including managed assets of $16.9 

billion and custody assets of $21.7 billion) at December 31, 2020 compared to $37.8 billion (including managed assets of $16.4 billion and custody assets of $21.4 billion) at December 31, 2019. 

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts. Service charges on deposit accounts for 2020 decreased $8.1 million, or 9.1%, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in overdraft/insufficient funds charges on consumer and commercial accounts (down $7.4 million and $2.7 million, respectively) and, to a lesser extent, consumer service charges (down $967 thousand) partly offset by an increase in commercial service charges (up $2.9 million). Overdraft/insufficient funds charges totaled $32.3 million ($25.8 million consumer and $6.5 million commercial) during 2020 compared to $42.3 million ($33.1 million consumer and $9.2 million commercial) during 2019. The decreases in both consumer and commercial overdraft/insufficient funds charges during 2020 were primarily related to a decrease in the volume of overdrafts relative to the same periods in 2019. Commercial service charges were impacted by a lower earnings credit rate partly offset by decreases in the volume of billable services. The earnings credit rate is the value given to deposits maintained by treasury management customers. Earnings credits applied to customer deposit balances offset service fees that would otherwise be charged. Because average market interest rates in 2020 have been lower compared to 2019, deposit balances have become less valuable and are yielding a lower earnings credit. 

Insurance Commissions and Fees. Insurance commissions and fees for 2020 decreased $2.0 million, or 3.9%, compared to 2019. The decrease was related to decreases in commission income (down $1.6 million) and contingent income (down $440 thousand). The decrease in commission income was primarily related to a decrease in benefit plan commissions related to decreased business volumes and premium reductions due to flat to lower market rates. 

Contingent income totaled $3.7 million in 2020 and $4.1 million in 2019. Contingent income primarily consists of amounts received from various property and casualty insurance carriers related to the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed. These performance related contingent payments are seasonal in nature and are mostly received during the first quarter of each year. This performance related contingent income totaled $2.5 million in 2020 and $3.0 million in 2019. The decrease in performance related contingent income during 2020 was related to lower growth within the portfolio combined with a deterioration in the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed. Contingent income also includes amounts received from various benefit plan insurance companies related to the volume of business generated and/or the subsequent retention of such business. This benefit plan related contingent income totaled $1.2 million in both 2020 and 2019. 

Notwithstanding normal seasonal variations, commission income during 2020 was partly impacted by reduced business volumes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Commission income in future periods may be similarly impacted. Benefit plan commissions may be particularly impacted by the effects of temporary furloughs and permanent layoffs. The COVID-19 pandemic has also given rise to a hard insurance market characterized by decreased capacity for most types of insurance coupled with higher premiums and more stringent underwriting standards among insurers. This may cause clients to drop or adjust coverage choices as part of expense control measures. Reduced business volumes may also adversely impact the level of contingent commissions we receive in 2021. 

Interchange and Debit Card Transaction Fees. Interchange fees, or &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, are charges that merchants pay to us and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Interchange and debit card transaction fees consist of income from check card usage, point of sale income from PIN-based debit card transactions and ATM service fees. Interchange and debit card transaction fees are reported net of related network costs. 

A comparison of gross and net interchange and debit card transaction fees for the reported periods is presented in the table below. Net revenues from interchange and debit card transactions during the reported periods were impacted by reduced transaction volumes, in part related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and increased network costs. 

##TABLE_START 2020 2019 2018 Income from debit card transactions $ 23,763 $ 23,665 $ 21,844 ATM service fees 3,342 4,131 3,925 Gross interchange and debit card transaction fees 27,105 27,796 25,769 Network costs 13,635 12,923 11,892 Net interchange and debit card transaction fees $ 13,470 $ 14,873 $ 13,877 ##TABLE_END

Federal Reserve rules applicable to financial institutions that have assets of $10 billion or more provide that the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. An upward adjustment of no more than 1 cent to an issuer's debit card interchange fee is allowed if the card issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve certain fraud-prevention standards. The Federal Reserve also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. 

Other Charges, Commissions and Fees. Other charges, commissions and fees for 2020 decreased $2.3 million, or 6.2%, compared to 2019. The decrease included decreases in income from the placement of money market accounts (down $3.0 million); letter of credit fees (down $568 thousand); income from the sale of life insurance (down $401 thousand); and funds transfer service charges (down $276 thousand); among other things. The decreases in these items were partly offset by increases in fees on unused loan commitments (up $1.5 million), income from the sale of mutual funds (up $442 thousand) and annuities (up $195 thousand) as well as increases in income from capital markets advisory services (up $153 thousand) and brokerage commissions (up $134 thousand), among other things. Income from the placement of money market accounts was impacted by a decrease in market rates. The other aforementioned revenue streams were impacted by fluctuations in transaction volumes. 

Net Gain/Loss on Securities Transactions . During 2020 and 2019, we sold certain available-for-sale securities with amortized costs totaling $1.0 billion and $18.7 billion, respectively. We realized a net gain of $109.0 million on the 2020 sales and a net gain of $293 thousand on the 2019 sales. During the first quarter of 2020, we sold $483.1 million of residential mortgage-backed securities and realized a net gain of $1.9 million on those sales. The proceeds from these sales were reinvested into other residential mortgage-backed securities that had lower pre-payment rates. We also sold $519.1 million of 30-year U.S Treasury securities during the first quarter of 2020 and realized a net gain of $107.1 million on those sales. These U.S. Treasury securities were purchased during the fourth quarter of 2019 to hedge, in effect, against falling interest rates. Prior to their sale, these securities had significant unrealized holding gains as a result of decreases in market interest rates during the first quarter of 2020. We elected to sell these securities to provide liquidity and realize the gains. 

During 2019, we purchased and subsequently sold $17.8 billion of U.S. Treasury securities in connection with our tax planning strategies related to the Texas franchise tax. The gross proceeds from the sales of these securities outside of Texas are included in total revenues/receipts from all sources reported for Texas franchise tax purposes, which results in a reduction in the overall percentage of revenues/receipts apportioned to Texas and subjected to taxation under the Texas franchise tax. We realized a net gain of $127 thousand on those sales. We also sold certain available-for-sale U.S. Treasury securities with an amortized cost totaling $548.9 million and certain available-for-sale municipal securities with an amortized cost totaling $310.7 million during 2019. We realized a net gain of $166 thousand on those sales. The proceeds from the sales provided short-term liquidity and were subsequently reinvested in other higher yielding securities. 

Other Non-Interest Income. Other non-interest income for 2020 increased $4.1 million, or 9.5%, compared to 2019. Other non-interest income during 2020 included approximately $6.0 million in gains realized on the sale of certain non-hedge related, short-term put options on U.S. Treasury securities with an aggregate notional amount of $500 million. The put options were not exercised and expired in March 2020. Gains realized from similar transactions in 2019 totaled $750 thousand. The increase in other non-interest income during 2020 was also partly related to increases in sundry and other miscellaneous income (up $2.4 million), income from customer derivative and trading activities (up $1.8 million) and public finance underwriting fees (up $1.7 million). The aforementioned items were partly offset by decreases in gains on the sale of foreclosed and other assets (down $6.1 million) and income from customer foreign exchange transactions (down $645 thousand), among other things. Sundry and other miscellaneous income during 2020 included a $2.7 million increase in check card related incentives/rebates and a $1.1 million increase in recoveries of prior write-offs, among other things. The fluctuations in income from customer derivative and trading activities, public finance underwriting fees and income from foreign exchange transactions were primarily related to changes in business volumes. Gains on the sale of foreclosed and other assets included gains on the sale of various branch and operational facilities totaling $758 thousand and $6.7 million, during 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Non-Interest Expense 

The components of non-interest expense were as follows: 

##TABLE_START 2020 2019 2018 Salaries and wages $ 387,328 $ 375,029 $ 350,312 Employee benefits 75,676 86,230 77,323 Net occupancy 102,938 89,466 76,788 Technology, furniture and equipment 105,232 91,995 83,102 Deposit insurance 10,502 10,126 16,397 Intangible amortization 918 1,168 1,424 Other 166,310 180,665 173,466 Total $ 848,904 $ 834,679 $ 778,812 ##TABLE_END

Total non-interest expense for 2020 increased $14.2 million, or 1.7%, compared to 2019. Changes in the various components of non-interest expense are discussed below. 

Salaries and Wages. Salaries and wages increased $12.3 million, or 3.3%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries, due to an increase in the number of employees and normal, annual merit and market increases. Salaries and wages for 2020 also included $5.2 million related to severance costs. The increases in the aforementioned items were partly offset by an increase in salary costs deferred as loan origination costs, up $5.9 million primarily in connection with the high volume of PPP loan originations during 2020, and decreases in incentive compensation, stock-based compensation and commissions. Salary costs deferred in connection with loan originations will be recognized as a yield adjustment component of interest income over the remaining terms of these loans. 

Employee Benefits . Employee benefits expense for 2020 decreased $10.6 million, or 12.2%, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily related to decreases in certain discretionary benefit plan expenses and expenses related to our defined benefit retirement and restoration plans partly offset by increases in medical benefits expense and payroll taxes, among other things. 

Our defined benefit retirement and restoration plans were frozen effective as of December 31, 2001 and were replaced by a profit sharing plan (which was merged with and into our 401(k) plan during 2019). Management believes these actions help reduce the volatility in retirement plan expense. However, we still have funding obligations related to the defined benefit and restoration plans and could recognize retirement expense related to these plans in future years, which would be dependent on the return earned on plan assets, the level of interest rates and employee turnover. We recognized a combined net periodic pension benefit of $2.0 million related to our defined benefit retirement and restoration plans in 2020 compared to a combined net periodic pension expense of $1.3 million in 2019. Future expense/benefits related to these plans is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the actual return on plan assets. A prolonged negative impact on the value of stocks and other asset classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a significant reduction to pension plan asset values and returns, which could impact the level of funding and expense. For additional information related to our employee benefit plans, see Note 11 - Employee Benefit Plans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. 

Net Occupancy. Net occupancy expense for 2020 increased $13.5 million, or 15.1%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily related to increases in lease expense (up $4.2 million), depreciation on leasehold improvements (up $4.0 million), property taxes (up $3.2 million) and building depreciation (up $1.4 million), among other things, partly offset by a decrease in repairs and maintenance/service contracts expense (down $977 thousand). Net occupancy expense was impacted by the commencement of the lease of our new corporate headquarters building in San Antonio in June 2019, as well as renewals of other leases related to existing facilities and new locations, in part related to our expansion within the Houston market area. 

Technology, Furniture and Equipment. Technology, furniture and equipment expense for 2020 increased $13.2 million, or 14.4%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily related to increases in cloud services expense (up $7.7 million), depreciation of furniture and equipment (up $3.5 million), software maintenance (up $2.1 million) and software amortization (up $1.6 million). The increase from the aforementioned items was partly offset by a decrease in service contracts expense (down $1.1 million). 

Deposit Insurance. Deposit insurance expense totaled $10.5 million in 2020 compared to $10.1 million in 2019. The increase was primarily related to an increase in total assets partly offset by a decrease in the assessment rate. 

Other Non-Interest Expense. Other non-interest expense for 2020 decreased $14.4 million, or 7.9%, compared to 2019. The decrease included decreases in travel, meals and entertainment expense (down $9.4 million); advertising/promotions expense (down $3.6 million); professional services expense (down $2.0 million); stationery, printing and supplies expense (down $1.5 million) and business development expense (down $1.2 million); among other things. The decrease in other non-interest expense during 2020 was also partly due to an increase in costs deferred as loan origination costs, up $1.9 million primarily in connection with the high volume of PPP loan originations during 2020. Costs deferred in connection with loan originations will be recognized as a yield adjustment component of interest income over the remaining terms of these loans. The impact of the aforementioned items was partly offset by increases in sundry and other miscellaneous expense (up $2.0 million), donations expense (up $1.4 million), bank card related expenses (up $1.3 million), telephone/data communications expense (up $1.0 million), and platform fees related to investment services (up $618 thousand), among other things. Sundry and other miscellaneous expense in 2020 included $958 thousand related to the announced closure of certain branch locations in our Houston market area and $454 thousand related to the write-off of certain other assets. 

Results of Segment Operations 

Our operations are managed along two primary operating segments: Banking and Frost Wealth Advisors. A description of each business and the methodologies used to measure financial performance is described in Note 18 - Operating Segments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. Net income (loss) by operating segment is presented below: 

##TABLE_START 2020 2019 2018 Banking $ 322,481 $ 436,416 $ 445,531 Frost Wealth Advisors 19,287 19,975 22,090 Non-Banks (10,617) (12,792) (12,703) Consolidated net income $ 331,151 $ 443,599 $ 454,918 ##TABLE_END

Banking 

Net income for 2020 decreased $113.9 million, or 26.1%, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily the result of a $207.5 million increase in credit loss expense, a $28.9 million decrease in net interest income and a $15.4 million increase in non-interest expense partly offset by a $102.7 million increase in non-interest income and a $35.2 million decrease in income tax expense. 

Net interest income for 2020 decreased $28.9 million, or 2.9%, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily related to decreases in the average yields on loans and interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) combined with, to a significantly lesser extent, decreases in the average volume of taxable securities (based on amortized cost) and increases in the average volume of interest-bearing deposit liabilities. The impact of these items was partly offset by increases in the average volumes of loans and interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) combined with decreases in the average cost of interest-bearing deposit liabilities and other borrowed funds. Net interest income during 2020 was also positively impacted by the additional day as a result of the leap year. See the analysis of net interest income included in the section captioned &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion. 

Credit loss expense for 2020 totaled $241.2 million compared to $33.8 million in 2019. Credit loss expense in 2020 was impacted by our adoption of a new credit loss accounting standard and the expected credit losses resulting from a deterioration in forecasted economic conditions and the current and uncertain future impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and recent volatility in oil prices. See the sections captioned &#8220;Credit Loss Expense&#8221; and &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of credit loss expense related to loans and off-balance-sheet commitments. 

Non-interest income for 2020 increased $102.7 million, or 47.0%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $109.0 million net gain on securities transactions. Excluding the net gain on securities transactions total non-interest income for the Banking segment decreased $6.0 million, or 2.8%, compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in service charges on deposit accounts; insurance commissions and fees; and interchange and debit card transaction fees; partly offset by an increase in other non-interest income. The decrease in service 

charges on deposit accounts was primarily related to decreases in overdraft/insufficient funds charges on consumer and commercial accounts due to decreases in transaction volumes. The decrease in insurance commissions and fees was the result of decreases in commission income and contingent income, which are further discussed below in relation to Frost Insurance Agency. The decrease in interchange and debit card transaction fees was impacted by reduced transaction volumes, in part related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and increased network costs. The increase in other non-interest income during 2020 included approximately $6.0 million in gains realized on the sale of certain non-hedge related, short-term put options on U.S. Treasury securities with an aggregate notional amount of $500 million. The put options were not exercised and expired in March 2020. The increase in other non-interest income was also partly related to increases in sundry and other miscellaneous income, income from customer derivative and trading activities and public finance underwriting fees. The aforementioned items were partly offset by decreases in gains on the sale of foreclosed and other assets and income from customer foreign exchange transactions, among other things. The fluctuations in income from customer derivative and trading activities, public finance underwriting fees and income from foreign exchange transactions were primarily related to changes in business volumes. See the analysis of these categories of non-interest income included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Non-interest expense for 2020 increased $15.4 million, or 2.2%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily related to increases in technology, furniture and equipment expense; salaries and wages; and net occupancy expense partly offset by decreases in other non-interest expense and employee benefits. The increase in technology, furniture and equipment expense was primarily related to increases in cloud services expense, depreciation of furniture and equipment, software maintenance and software amortization. The increase from the aforementioned items was partly offset by a decrease in service contracts expense. The increase in salary and wages was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and normal, annual merit and market increases partly offset by an increase in salary costs deferred as loan origination costs, primarily in connection with the high volume of PPP loan originations during 2020, and decreases in incentive compensation, stock-based compensation and commissions. Salaries and wages for 2020 was also negatively impacted by certain severance costs. The increase in net occupancy expense was primarily related to increases in depreciation on leasehold improvements, lease expense, property taxes and building depreciation, among other things. The increases from these items were partly offset by decreases in repairs and maintenance/service contracts expense. The decrease in other non-interest expense included decreases in travel, meals and entertainment expense; professional services expense; advertising/promotions expense; and business development expense, among other things. The decrease in other non-interest expense was also partly due to an increase in costs deferred as loan origination costs in connection with the high volume of PPP loan originations during 2020. The impact of the aforementioned items was partly offset by increases in sundry losses and other expenses, donations expense, and bank card expense, among other things. The decrease in employee benefit costs was primarily related to decreases in certain discretionary benefit plan expenses and expenses related to our defined benefit retirement and restoration plans partly offset by increases in medical benefits expense and payroll taxes, among other things. See the analysis of these categories of non-interest expense included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Expense&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Income tax expense for 2020 decreased $35.2 million, or 63.4%, compared to 2019. See the section captioned &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion. 

Frost Insurance Agency, which is included in the Banking operating segment, had gross commission revenues of $51.1 million during 2020 compared to $53.1 million during 2019. The decrease was the result of decreases in commission income and contingent income. The decrease in commission income was primarily related to a decreases in benefit plan commissions related to decreased business volumes and premium reductions due to flat to lower market rates. The decrease in contingent income was related to lower growth and a deterioration in the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed. See the analysis of insurance commissions and fees included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Frost Wealth Advisors 

Net income for 2020 decreased $688 thousand, or 3.4%, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.2 million decrease in net interest income and a $637 thousand decrease in non-interest income partly offset by a $992 thousand decrease in non-interest expense and a $181 thousand decrease in income tax expense. 

Net interest income for 2020 decreased $1.2 million, or 30.6%, compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average funds transfer prices allocated to the funds provided by Frost Wealth Advisors. The decrease in the average funds transfer price was primarily due to decreases in market interest rates. See the analysis of net interest income included in the section captioned &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Non-interest income for 2020 decreased $637 thousand, or 0.4%, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in other charges, commissions and fees; and other non-interest income partly offset by an increase in trust and investment management fees. The decrease in other charges commissions and fees was primarily due to decreases in income from the placement of money market accounts and life insurance, among other things, partly offset by increases in income from the placement of mutual funds and annuities and an increase in brokerage commissions. Income from the placement of money market accounts was impacted by a decrease in market rates. The other aforementioned revenue streams were impacted by fluctuations in transaction volumes. The decrease in other non-interest income was primarily related to a decrease in income from customer derivative and trading activities related to a decrease in volume. Trust and investment management fee income is the most significant income component for Frost Wealth Advisors. Investment management fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees, making up approximately 84% and 82% of total trust and investment management fees for 2020 and 2019. The increase in trust and investment management fees during 2020 was primarily due to increases in investment management fees, custody fees and real estate fees partly offset by a decrease in oil and gas fees. See the analysis of trust and investment management fees, particularly as it relates to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and other charges, commissions and fees included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Non-interest expense for 2020 decreased $992 thousand, or 0.8%, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in net occupancy expense partly offset by decreases in employee benefits, other non-interest expense and salaries and wages. The increase in net occupancy expense was primarily related to an increase in lease expense. The decrease in employee benefits was primarily related to a decrease in certain discretionary benefit plan expenses. The decrease in other non-interest expense was primarily related to decreases in travel, meals and entertainment expense and professional service expense, among other things. Salaries and wages were impacted by decreases in incentive compensation and commissions despite an increase in salaries, due to an increase in the number of employees and normal, annual merit and market increases. 

Non-Banks 

The Non-Banks operating segment had a net loss of $10.6 million for 2020 compared to a net loss of $12.8 million in 2019. The decreased net loss was primarily due to a decrease in net interest expense resulting from lower average rates paid on our long term borrowings. 

Income Taxes 

We recognized income tax expense of $20.2 million, for an effective tax rate of 5.7%, in 2020 compared to $55.9 million, for an effective tax rate of 11.2%, in 2019. The effective income tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 21% during 2020 and 2019 primarily due to the effect of tax-exempt income from loans, securities and life insurance policies and the income tax effects associated with stock-based compensation, among other things, and their relative proportion to total pre-tax net income. The decrease in the effective tax rate during 2020 was primarily related to a decrease in pre-tax net income. The effective tax rate during 2020 was also impacted by a one-time, discrete tax benefit associated with an asset contribution to a charitable trust. See Note 13 - Income Taxes in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. 

Sources and Uses of Funds 

The following table illustrates, during the years presented, the mix of our funding sources and the assets in which those funds are invested as a percentage of our average total assets for the period indicated. Average assets totaled $38.0 billion in 2020 compared to $32.1 billion in 2019. 

##TABLE_START 2020 2019 2018 Sources of Funds: Deposits: Non-interest-bearing 35.7 % 32.3 % 34.7 % Interest-bearing 47.1 50.1 50.1 Federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements 3.9 4.0 3.4 Long-term debt and other borrowings 0.9 0.7 0.8 Other non-interest-bearing liabilities 1.8 1.4 0.5 Equity capital 10.6 11.5 10.5 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Uses of Funds: Loans 45.2 % 45.0 % 43.9 % Securities 33.4 41.4 38.9 Federal funds sold, resell agreements and interest-bearing deposits 14.2 5.8 10.3 Other non-interest-earning assets 7.2 7.8 6.9 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % ##TABLE_END

Deposits continue to be our primary source of funding. Average deposits increased $5.0 billion, or 19.0%, in 2020 compared to 2019. Non-interest-bearing deposits remain a significant source of funding, which has been a key factor in maintaining our relatively low cost of funds. Average non-interest-bearing deposits totaled 43.1% of total average deposits in 2020 compared to 39.2% in 2019. Though federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits were repealed in 2011, we have not experienced any significant additional costs as a result. Should the market dictate, we may increase the interest rates we pay on some or all of our various interest-bearing deposit products. This could lead to a decrease in the relative proportion of non-interest-bearing deposits to total deposits. 

We primarily invest funds in loans and securities. Average loans increased $2.7 billion, or 18.9%, ($565.4 million, or 3.92% excluding PPP loans) in 2020 compared to 2019 while average securities decreased $616.0 million, or 4.6%, in 2020 compared to 2019. Average federal funds sold and resell agreements and interest-bearing deposits increased $3.5 billion, or 190.1%, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily as a result of deposit growth.

Overview. Year-end total loans increased $2.7 billion, or 18.5%, during 2020 compared to 2019. As further discussed below, during the second quarter of 2020, we began originating loans to qualified small businesses under the PPP administered by the SBA under the provisions of the CARES Act. Excluding PPP loans, total loans would have otherwise increased $297.1 million, or 2.0%, from December 31, 2019. The majority of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans, energy loans and real estate loans. Commercial and industrial loans made up 28.4% (32.9% excluding PPP loans) and 35.2% of total loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019 while energy loans made up 7.1% (8.2% excluding PPP loans) and 11.2% of total loans at both December 31, 2020 and 2019 and real estate loans made up 47.7% (55.5% excluding PPP loans) and 50.1% of total loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Energy loans include commercial and industrial loans, leases and real estate loans to borrowers in the energy industry. Real estate loans include both commercial and consumer balances. Other than in connection with our making PPP loans as described below, it is possible that the effects of COVID-19 could continue to result in less demand for our loan products. 

Loan Origination/Risk Management. We have certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and non-performing and potential problem loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions. 

Commercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower&#8217;s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business. Underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Once it is determined that the borrower&#8217;s management possesses sound ethics and solid business acumen, our management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee; however, some short-term 

loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. 

Our energy loan portfolio includes loans for production, energy services and other energy loans, which includes private clients, transportation and equipment providers, manufacturers, refiners and traders. The origination process for energy loans is similar to that of commercial and industrial loans. Because, however, of the average loan size, the significance of the portfolio and the specialized nature of the energy industry, our energy lending requires a highly prescriptive underwriting policy. Production loans are secured by proven, developed and producing reserves. Loan proceeds are used for the development and drilling of additional wells, the acquisition of additional production, and/or the acquisition of additional properties to be developed and drilled. Our customers in this sector are generally large, independent, private owner-producers or large corporate producers. These borrowers typically have large capital requirements for drilling and acquisitions, and as such, loans in this portfolio are generally greater than $10 million. Production loans are collateralized by the oil and gas interests of the borrower. Collateral values are determined by the risk-adjusted and limited discounted future net revenue of the reserves. Our valuations take into consideration geographic and reservoir differentials as well as cost structures associated with each borrower. Collateral is calculated at least semi-annually using third party engineer-prepared reserve studies. These reserve studies are conducted using a discount factor and base case assumptions for the current and future value of oil and gas. To qualify as collateral, typically reserves must be proven, developed and producing. For certain borrowers, collateral may include up to 20% proven, non-producing reserves. Loan commitments are limited to 65% of estimated reserve value. Cash flows must be sufficient to amortize the loan commitment within 120% of the half-life of the underlying reserves. Loan commitments generally must also be 100% covered by the risk-adjusted and limited discounted future net revenue of the reserves when stressed at 75% of our base case price assumptions. In addition, the ratio of the borrower's debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&#8220;EBITDA&#8221;) should generally not exceed 350%. 

Oil and gas service, transportation, and equipment providers are economically aligned due to their reliance on drilling and active oil and gas development. Income for these borrowers is highly dependent on the level of drilling activity and rig utilization, both of which are driven by the current and future outlook for the price of oil and gas. We mitigate the credit risk in this sector through conservative concentration limits and guidelines on the profile of eligible borrowers. Guidelines require that the companies have extensive experience through several industry cycles, and that they be supported by financially competent and committed guarantors who provide a significant secondary source of repayment. Borrowers in this sector are typically privately-owned, middle-market companies with annual sales of less than $100 million. The services provided by companies in this sector are highly diversified, and include down-hole testing and maintenance, providing and threading drilling pipe, hydraulic fracturing services or equipment, seismic testing and equipment and other direct or indirect providers to the oil and gas production sector. 

Our private client portfolio primarily consists of loans to wealthy individuals and their related oil and gas exploration and production entities, where the oil and gas producing reserves are not considered to be the primary source of repayment. These borrowers and guarantors typically have significant sources of wealth including significant liquid assets and/or cash flow from other investments which can fully repay the loans. The credit structures of these loans are generally similar to those of energy production loans, described above, with respect to the valuation of the reserves taken as collateral and the repayment structures. 

Although no balances were outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019, in prior years we have had a small portfolio of loans to refiners where our credit involvement with these customers was through purchases of shared national credit syndications. These borrowers refine crude oil into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, asphalt and other petrochemicals and are not dependent on drilling or development. All of the borrowers in this portfolio are very large public companies that are important employers in several of our major markets. These borrowers, for the most part, have been long-term customers and we have a strong relationship with these companies and their executive management. There is no new customer origination process for this segment and any outstanding balances are expected to only reflect the needs of these existing relationships. 

We also have a small portfolio of loans to energy trading companies that serve as intermediaries that buy and sell oil, gas, other petrochemicals, and ethanol. These companies are not dependent on drilling or development. As a general policy, we do not lend to energy traders; however, we have made an exception to this policy for certain customers based upon their underlying business models which minimize risk as commodities are bought only to fill existing orders (back-to-back trading). As such, the commodity price risk and sale risk are eliminated. There is no 

new customer origination process for this segment and any outstanding balances are expected to only reflect the needs of these existing relationships. 

PPP loans, which we began originating in April 2020, are loans to qualified small businesses under the PPP administered by the SBA under the provisions of the CARES Act. Loans covered by the PPP may be eligible for loan forgiveness for certain costs incurred related to payroll, group health care benefit costs and qualifying mortgage, rent and utility payments. The remaining loan balance after forgiveness of any amounts is still fully guaranteed by the SBA. Terms of the PPP loans include the following (i) maximum amount limited to the lesser of $10 million or an amount calculated using a payroll-based formula, (ii) maximum loan term of five years, (iii) interest rate of 1.00%, (iv) no collateral or personal guarantees are required, (v) no payments are required until the date on which the forgiveness amount relating to the loan is remitted to the lender and (vi) loan forgiveness up to the full principal amount of the loan and any accrued interest, subject to certain requirements including that no more than 40% of the loan forgiveness amount may be attributable to non-payroll costs. In return for processing and booking a PPP loan, the SBA paid lenders a processing fee tiered by the size of the loan (5% for loans of not more than $350 thousand; 3% for loans of more than $350 thousand and less than $2 million; and 1% for loans of at least $2 million). 

Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans, in addition to those of real estate loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing our commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location within Texas. This diversity helps reduce our exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. As a general rule, we avoid financing single-purpose projects unless other underwriting factors are present to help mitigate risk. We also utilize third-party experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting market areas we serve. In addition, management tracks the level of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans versus non-owner occupied loans. At December 31, 2020, approximately 46.4% of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans were secured by owner-occupied properties. 

With respect to loans to developers and builders that are secured by non-owner occupied properties that we may originate from time to time, we generally require the borrower to have had an existing relationship with us and have a proven record of success. Construction loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project. These estimates may be inaccurate. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans from approved long-term lenders, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from us until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing. 

We originate consumer loans utilizing a computer-based credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process. To monitor and manage consumer loan risk, policies and procedures are developed and modified, as needed, jointly by line and staff personnel. This activity, coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, minimizes risk. Additionally, trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis. Underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements, which include, but are not limited to, loan-to-value limitations, collection remedies, the number of such loans a borrower can have at one time and documentation requirements. 

We maintain an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis. Results of these reviews are presented to management and the appropriate committees of our board of directors. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as our policies and procedures. 

Commercial and Industrial . Commercial and industrial loans decreased $232.1 million, or 4.5%, during 2020 compared to 2019. Our commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans to small, medium and large businesses. The purpose of these loans varies from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment. While some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis, most are secured by the assets being financed with collateral margins that are consistent with our loan policy guidelines. The commercial and industrial loan portfolio also includes the commercial lease and purchased shared national credits. 

Energy . Energy loans include loans to entities and individuals that are engaged in various energy-related activities including (i) the development and production of oil or natural gas, (ii) providing oil and gas field servicing, (iii) providing energy-related transportation services (iv) providing equipment to support oil and gas drilling (v) refining petrochemicals, or (vi) trading oil, gas and related commodities. Energy loans decreased $417.7 million, or 25.3%, during 2020 compared to 2019. The average loan size, the significance of the portfolio and the specialized nature of the energy industry requires a highly prescriptive underwriting policy. Exceptions to this policy are rarely granted. Due to the large borrowing requirements of this customer base, the energy loan portfolio includes participations and purchased shared national credits. 

Paycheck Protection Program. PPP loans include loans to businesses and other entities that would otherwise be reported as commercial and industrial loans and, to a lesser extent, energy loans, originated under the guidelines discussed above. Through December 31, 2020, we have funded approximately $3.3 billion of SBA-approved PPP loans. During 2020, we recognized $59.5 million in PPP loan related deferred processing fees (net of amortization of related deferred origination costs) as yield adjustments and this amount is included in interest income on loans. As a result of the inclusion of these net fees in interest income, the average yield on PPP loans was approximately 3.78% during 2020 compared to the stated interest rate of 1.0% on these loans. As of December 31, 2020, we expect to recognize additional PPP loan related deferred processing fees (net of deferred origination costs) totaling approximately $39.5 million as a yield adjustment over the remaining terms of these loans, most of which is expected to be recognized in 2021. 

Industry Concentrations. As of December 31, 2020, there were no concentrations of loans related to any single industry, as segregated by Standard Industrial Classification code (&#8220;SIC code&#8221;), in excess of 10% of total loans. The largest industry concentration was related to the energy industry, which totaled 7.1% of total loans, or 8.2% excluding PPP loans. As of December 31, 2019, there were no concentrations of loans related to any single industry in excess of 10% of total loans other than energy loans, which totaled 11.2% of total loans at such date. The SIC code system is a federally designed standard industrial numbering system used by us to categorize loans by the borrower&#8217;s type of business. The following table summarizes the industry concentrations of our loan portfolio, as segregated by SIC code. Industry concentrations, stated as a percentage of year-end total loans as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, are presented below:

Large Credit Relationships. The market areas served by us include three of the top ten most populated cities in the United States. These market areas are also home to a significant number of Fortune 500 companies. As a result, we originate and maintain large credit relationships with numerous commercial customers in the ordinary course of business. We consider large credit relationships to be those with commitments equal to or in excess of $10.0 million, excluding treasury management lines exposure, prior to any portion being sold. Large relationships also include loan participations purchased if the credit relationship with the agent is equal to or in excess of $10.0 million. In addition to our normal policies and procedures related to the origination of large credits, one of our Regional Credit Committees must approve all new credit facilities which are part of large credit relationships and renewals of such credit facilities with exposures between $20.0 million and $30.0 million. Our Central Credit Committee must approve all new credit facilities which are part of large credit relationships and renewals of such credit facilities with exposures that exceed $30.0 million. The Regional and Central Credit Committees meet regularly to review large credit relationship activity and discuss the current pipeline, among other things. 

The following table provides additional information on our large credit relationships outstanding at year-end.

Purchased Shared National Credits (&#8220;SNCs&#8221;). Purchased SNCs are participations purchased from upstream financial organizations and tend to be larger in size than our originated portfolio. Our purchased SNC portfolio totaled $788.1 million at December 31, 2020 decreasing $160.7 million, or 16.9%, from $948.8 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, 32.1% of outstanding purchased SNCs were related to the energy industry, 24.5% of outstanding purchased SNCs were related to the construction industry, 12.6% of outstanding purchased SNCs were related to the financial services industry and 12.1% outstanding purchased SNCs were related to the real estate industry. The remaining purchased SNCs were diversified throughout various other industries, with no other single industry exceeding 10% of the total purchased SNC portfolio. Additionally, almost all of the outstanding balance of purchased SNCs was included in the energy and commercial and industrial portfolios, with the remainder included in the real estate categories. SNC participations are originated in the normal course of business to meet the needs of our customers. As a matter of policy, we generally only participate in SNCs for companies headquartered in or which have significant operations within our market areas. In addition, we must have direct access to the company&#8217;s management, an existing banking relationship or the expectation of broadening the relationship with other banking products and services within the following 12 to 24 months. SNCs are reviewed at least quarterly for credit quality and business development successes. 

The following table provides additional information about certain credits within our purchased SNCs portfolio as of year-end.

Real Estate Loans. Real estate loans increased $960.6 million, or 13.0%, during 2020 compared to 2019. Real estate loans include both commercial and consumer balances. Commercial real estate loans totaled $7.0 billion, or 84.1% of total real estate loans, at December 31, 2020 and $6.2 billion, or 83.8% of total real estate loans, at December 31, 2019. The majority of this portfolio consists of commercial real estate mortgages, which includes both permanent and intermediate term loans. Loans secured by owner-occupied properties make up a significant portion of our commercial real estate portfolio. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Consequently, these loans must undergo the analysis and underwriting process of a commercial and industrial loan, as well as that of a real estate loan. 

The following tables summarize our commercial real estate loan portfolio, including commercial real estate loans reported as a component of our energy loan portfolio segment, as segregated by (i) the type of property securing the credit and (ii) the geographic region in which the loans were originated. Property type concentrations are stated as a percentage of year-end total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:

Consumer Loans . The consumer loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 increased $122.7 million, or 7.2%, from December 31, 2019. As the following table illustrates, the consumer loan portfolio has two distinct segments, including consumer real estate and consumer and other. 

##TABLE_START 2020 2019 Consumer real estate: Home equity loans $ 329,390 $ 375,596 Home equity lines of credit 452,854 354,671 Other 548,530 464,146 Total consumer real estate 1,330,774 1,194,413 Consumer and other 505,680 519,332 Total consumer loans $ 1,836,454 $ 1,713,745 ##TABLE_END

Consumer real estate loans at December 31, 2020 increased $136.4 million, or 11.4%, from December 31, 2019. Combined, home equity loans and lines of credit made up 58.8% and 61.1% of the consumer real estate loan total at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We offer home equity loans up to 80% of the estimated value of the personal residence of the borrower, less the value of existing mortgages and home improvement loans. In general, we do not originate 1-4 family mortgage loans; however, from time to time, we may invest in such loans to meet the needs of our customers. The consumer and other loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 decreased $13.7 million, or 2.6%, from December 31, 2019. This portfolio primarily consists of automobile loans, unsecured revolving credit products, personal loans secured by cash and cash equivalents, and other similar types of credit facilities. 

Foreign Loans . We make U.S. dollar-denominated loans and commitments to borrowers in Mexico. The outstanding balance of these loans and the unfunded amounts available under these commitments were not significant at December 31, 2020 or 2019. 

Maturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates. The following table presents the maturity distribution of our commercial and industrial loans, energy loans and commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2020. The table also presents the portion of loans that have fixed interest rates or variable interest rates that fluctuate over the life of the loans in accordance with changes in an interest rate index such as the prime rate or LIBOR.

We generally structure commercial loans with shorter-term maturities in order to match our funding sources and to enable us to effectively manage the loan portfolio by providing the flexibility to respond to liquidity needs, changes in interest rates and changes in underwriting standards and loan structures, among other things. Due to the shorter-term nature of such loans, from time to time and in the ordinary course of business, we will renew/extend maturing lines of credit or refinance existing loans at their maturity dates. Some loans may renew multiple times in a given year as a result of general customer practice and need. These renewals, extensions and refinancings are made in the ordinary course of business for customers that meet our normal level of credit standards. Such borrowers typically request renewals to support their on-going working capital needs to finance their operations. Such borrowers are not experiencing financial difficulties and generally could obtain similar financing from another financial institution. In connection with each renewal, extension or refinancing, we may require a principal 

reduction, adjust the rate of interest and/or modify the structure and other terms to reflect the current market pricing/structuring for such loans or to maintain competitiveness with other financial institutions. In such cases, we do not generally grant concessions, and, except for those reported in Note 3 - Loans, any such renewals, extensions or refinancings that occurred during the reported periods were not deemed to be troubled debt restructurings pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. Loans exceeding $1.0 million undergo a complete underwriting process at each renewal. 

Non-Performing Assets and Potential Problem Loans 

Non-Performing Assets. Year-end non-performing assets and accruing past due loans were as follows: 

##TABLE_START 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 Non-accrual loans: Commercial and industrial $ 19,849 $ 26,038 $ 9,239 $ 46,186 $ 31,475 Energy 23,168 65,761 46,932 94,302 57,571 Paycheck Protection Program &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Commercial real estate 17,421 9,577 15,268 7,589 8,550 Consumer real estate 993 922 892 2,109 2,130 Consumer and other 18 5 1,408 128 425 Total non-accrual loans 61,449 102,303 73,739 150,314 100,151 Restructured loans &#8212; 6,098 &#8212; 4,862 &#8212; Foreclosed assets: Real estate 850 1,084 1,175 2,116 2,440 Other &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Total foreclosed assets 850 1,084 1,175 2,116 2,440 Total non-performing assets $ 62,299 $ 109,485 $ 74,914 $ 157,292 $ 102,591 Ratio of non-performing assets to: Total loans and foreclosed assets 0.36 % 0.74 % 0.53 % 1.20 % 0.86 % Total loans, excluding PPP loans, and foreclosed assets 0.41 0.74 0.53 1.20 0.86 Total assets 0.15 0.32 0.23 0.50 0.34 Accruing past due loans: 30 to 89 days past due $ 88,598 $ 50,784 $ 59,595 $ 93,428 $ 55,456 90 or more days past due 14,289 7,421 20,468 14,432 24,864 Total accruing past due loans $ 102,887 $ 58,205 $ 80,063 $ 107,860 $ 80,320 Ratio of accruing past due loans to total loans: 30 to 89 days past due 0.51 % 0.34 % 0.42 % 0.71 % 0.46 % 90 or more days past due 0.08 0.05 0.15 0.11 0.21 Total accruing past due loans 0.59 % 0.39 % 0.57 % 0.82 % 0.67 % Ratio of accruing past due loans to total loans, excluding PPP loans: 30 to 89 days past due 0.59 % 0.34 % 0.42 % 0.71 % 0.46 % 90 or more days past due 0.09 0.05 0.15 0.11 0.21 Total accruing past due loans 0.68 % 0.39 % 0.57 % 0.82 % 0.67 % ##TABLE_END

Non-performing assets include non-accrual loans, restructured loans and foreclosed assets. Non-performing assets at December 31, 2020 decreased $47.2 million compared to December 31, 2019 reflecting decreases in non-accrual energy loans, non-accrual commercial and industrial loans and restructured loans partly, some of which resulted from charge-offs, offset by an increase in non-accrual commercial real estate loans. 

Generally, loans are placed on non-accrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due and/or management deems the collectibility of the principal and/or interest to be in question, as well as when required by regulatory requirements. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations. Subsequent receipts on non-accrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Classification of a loan as non-accrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest. 

Non-accrual commercial and industrial loans included one credit relationship in excess of $5.0 million totaling $9.0 million at December 31, 2020. This credit relationship was previously reported as non-accrual with an aggregate balance of $8.4 million at December 31, 2019. Non-accrual energy loans included one credit relationship in excess of $5.0 million totaling $20.1 million at December 31, 2020 and two credit relationships in excess of $5.0 million totaling $61.7 million at December 31, 2019. During 2020, we charged off $76.1 million related to energy loans. Of that amount, $48.8 million related to credit relationships previously reported as non-accrual as of December 31, 2019. Non-accrual real estate loans primarily consist of land development, 1-4 family residential construction credit relationships and loans secured by office buildings and religious facilities. There were no non-accrual commercial real estate loans in excess of $5.0 million at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. 

There were no restructured loans outstanding at December 31, 2020, other than those reported as non-accrual in the table above. Restructured loans at December 31, 2019 totaled $6.1 million and consisted of three credit relationships primarily related to commercial real estate. 

Foreclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. Foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure. Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for credit losses on loans. Regulatory guidelines require us to reevaluate the fair value of foreclosed assets on at least an annual basis. Our policy is to comply with the regulatory guidelines. Write-downs are provided for subsequent declines in value and are included in other non-interest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties. Write-downs of foreclosed assets totaled $231 thousand during 2020 and $473 thousand during 2018 while there were no write-downs in 2019. There were no significant concentrations of any properties, to which the aforementioned write-downs relate, in any single geographic region. 

Accruing past due loans at December 31, 2020 increased $44.7 million compared to December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily related to increases in past due commercial and industrial loans (up $26.2 million) and to a lesser extent past due energy loans (up $8.0 million ) and non-construction related commercial real estate loans (up $7.3 million). 

Potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms but for which management has concerns about the ability of an obligor to continue to comply with repayment terms because of the obligor&#8217;s potential operating or financial difficulties. Management monitors these loans closely and reviews their performance on a regular basis. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $85.2 million and $46.8 million in loans of this type which are not included in any one of the non-accrual, restructured or 90 days past due loan categories. At December 31, 2020, potential problem loans consisted of eleven credit relationships. Of the total outstanding balance at December 31, 2020, 32.6% was related to the energy industry, 30.2% was related to the hotel/lodging industry and 19.8% was related to the restaurant industry. Weakness in these organizations&#8217; operating performance and financial condition, among other factors, have caused us to heighten the attention given to these credits. As such, all of the loans identified as potential problem loans at December 31, 2020 were graded as &#8220;substandard - accrual&#8221; (risk grade 11). 

Certain borrowers are currently unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the adverse effects of COVID-19. In an effort to mitigate these effects, loan customers may apply for a deferral of payments, or portions thereof, for up to 90 days. After 90 days, customers may apply for an additional deferral, and a small proportion of our customers have requested such an additional deferral. In the absence of other intervening factors, such short-term modifications made on a good faith basis are not categorized as troubled debt restructurings, nor are loans granted payment deferrals related to COVID-19 reported as past due or placed on non-accrual status (provided the loans were not past due or on non-accrual status prior to the deferral). The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to an increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number and amount of our loans have experienced ratings downgrades, credit deterioration and defaults. We have a significant amount of loans in certain industries that have been particularly impacted. These include energy, retail/strip centers, hotels/lodging, restaurants, entertainment and commercial real estate, among others. See additional information about the effects of and risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in the section captioned &#8220;Recent Developments Related to COVID-19&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion and Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors elsewhere in this report. 

Allowance For Credit Losses 

As discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements, our policies and procedures related to accounting for credit losses changed on January 1, 2020 in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard update as codified in Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 326 (&#8220;ASC 326&#8221;) Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. In the case of loans and securities, allowances for credit losses are contra-asset valuation accounts, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets.

Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans. The table below provides an allocation of the year-end allowance for credit losses on loans by loan portfolio segment; however, allocation of a portion of the allowance to one segment does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other segments:

Upon the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans estimated using the CECL methodology decreased $2.6 million compared to the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans estimated as of December 31, 2019 using the prior incurred loss model. Fluctuations in the estimated allowances by portfolio segment offset one another, for the most part, and, as a result, the overall estimated amount of allowance for credit losses did not significantly change as a result of the change in methodology. The manner in which credit loss allowances are allocated to the individual portfolio segments was partly impacted by a change in the way the underlying loans within each segment are pooled for modeling purposes. The impact of varying economic conditions and portfolio stress factors are now a component of the credit loss models applied to each modeling pool. In that regard, the amounts allocated to the underlying pools of loans within 

each portfolio segment more directly reflect the economic variables and portfolio stress factors that correlate with credit losses within each portfolio. Under the prior methodology, allocations in excess of those derived from historical loss rates were recognized as an allocation on each of the various portfolios based upon management judgment. Nonetheless, despite fluctuations in the allocation of portions of the overall allowance to the various portfolio segments, the entire allowance is available to absorb any credit losses within the entire loan portfolio. The remainder of this discussion focuses on expected credit losses estimated as of December 31, 2020 compared to the post ASC 326 estimate of expected credit losses as of January 1, 2020. 

The allowance allocated to commercial and industrial loans totaled $73.8 million, or 1.49% of total commercial and industrial loans, at December 31, 2020 increasing $987 thousand, or 1.4%, compared to $72.9 million, or 1.40% of total commercial and industrial loans, post ASC 326 adoption on January 1, 2020. Modeled expected credit losses increased $8.5 million while qualitative factor (&#8220;Q-Factor&#8221;) adjustments related to commercial and industrial loans decreased $4.8 million. Specific allocations for commercial and industrial loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis decreased from $7.9 million post ASC 326 adoption on January 1, 2020 to $5.3 million at December 31, 2020. The allowance allocated to energy loans totaled $39.6 million, or 3.20% of total energy loans, at December 31, 2020 increasing $12.6 million, or 46.9%, compared to $26.9 million, or 1.63% of total energy loans, post ASC 326 adoption on January 1, 2020. Modeled expected credit losses related to energy loans increased $3.0 million while Q-Factor adjustments related to energy loans increased $20.4 million. Specific allocations for energy loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis totaled $20.2 million post ASC 326 adoption on January 1, 2020. The loans to which these specific allocations were related were subsequently charged off and there were $9.4 million of specific allocations related to energy loans at December 31, 2020. The allowance allocated to commercial real estate loans totaled $134.9 million, or 1.92% of total commercial real estate loans, at December 31, 2020 increasing $117.4 million, or 670.0%, compared to $17.5 million, or 0.28% of total commercial real estate loans, post ASC 326 adoption on January 1, 2020. Modeled expected credit losses related to commercial real estate loans increased $109.8 million while Q-Factor adjustments related to commercial real estate loans increased $7.5 million. Specific allocations for commercial real estate loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis increased from $383 thousand post ASC 326 adoption on January 1, 2020 to $513 thousand at December 31, 2020. The allowance allocated to consumer real estate loans totaled $7.9 million, or 0.60% of total consumer real estate loans, at December 31, 2020 increasing $1.4 million, or 21.8%, compared to $6.5 million, or 0.54% of total consumer real estate loans, post ASC 326 adoption on January 1, 2020. Modeled expected credit losses related to consumer real estate loans increased $2.0 million while Q-Factor adjustments related to consumer real estate loans decreased $591 thousand. The allowance allocated to consumer loans totaled $7.0 million, or 1.38% of total consumer loans, at December 31, 2020 increasing $1.2 million, or 20.2%, compared to $5.8 million, or 1.12% of total consumer loans, post ASC 326 adoption on January 1, 2020. Modeled expected credit losses related to consumer loans increased $1.3 million while Q-Factor adjustments related to consumer loans decreased $154 thousand. 

As more fully described in Note 3 - Loans in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of models which measure probability of default and loss given default, among other things. The measurement of expected credit losses is impacted by loan/borrower attributes and certain macroeconomic variables. Models are adjusted to reflect the current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. 

In estimating expected credit losses as of December 31, 2020, we utilized the Moody&#8217;s Analytics December 2020 BL Baseline Scenario (the &#8220;December BL Scenario&#8221;) to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models. The December BL Scenario was based on the review of a variety of surveys of baseline forecasts of the U.S. economy. The December BL Scenario projections included, among other things, (i) U.S. Gross Domestic Product (&#8220;GDP&#8221;) annualized quarterly growth rate of 4.6% for the fourth quarter of 2020 followed by projected annualized quarterly growth rates in the range of approximately 3.0% to 8.0% during 2021 and 6.0% to 7.5% through the end of the forecast period in the fourth quarter of 2022; (ii) a U.S. unemployment rate of 6.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and an average projected rate of 7.0% in 2021 and 6.0% in 2022, with the fourth quarter of 2022 projected to be 5.4% (Texas unemployment rates are projected to be slightly less for those periods); and (iii) an average 10 year Treasury rate of 0.79% in the fourth quarter of 2020, increasing to an average projected rate of 1.05% in 2021 and 2.04% in 2022. The December BL Scenario also projected average oil prices of $40 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2020, $45 per barrel on average for the year in 2021 and $55 per barrel on average for the year in 2022, with the fourth quarter of 2022 projected to be $59 per barrel. 

The economic forecast used in our initial estimate of expected credit losses under ASC 326 on January 1, 2020 projected that the Texas unemployment rate would remain below 4.0% through 2021. The increases in modeled expected credit losses across all of our loan portfolios as of December 31, 2020 compared to the modeled expected credit losses as of our initial adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020 were primarily the result of changes in our economic forecast, particularly forecasts related to unemployment and the gross domestic product, as well as changes in portfolio volumes and risk attributes, as discussed below. 

The overall loan portfolio, excluding PPP loans which are fully guaranteed by the SBA, increased $297.1 million, or 2.0%, which included a $824.2 million, or 13.3%, increase in commercial real estate loans and a $136.4 million, or 11.4%, increase in consumer real estate loans partly offset by a $232.1 million, or 4.5%, decrease in commercial and industrial loans, a $417.7 million, or 25.3%, decrease in energy loans and a $13.7 million, or 2.6% decrease in consumer and other loans. The weighted average risk grade for commercial and industrial loans did not significantly change totaling 6.45 at December 31, 2020 compared to 6.44 at December 31, 2019. Commercial and industrial loans graded &#8220;watch&#8221; and &#8220;special mention&#8221; (risk grades 9 and 10) increased $63.5 million during 2020 while classified commercial and industrial loans decreased $12.9 million. Classified loans consist of loans having a risk grade of 11, 12 or 13. The weighted-average risk grade for energy loans increased to 6.85 at December 31, 2020 from 6.39 at December 31, 2019. The increase in the weighted average risk grade was primarily related to a $6.6 million increase in classified energy loans and a $95.9 million increase in energy loans graded &#8220;watch&#8221; and &#8220;special mention,&#8221; while pass grade energy loans decreased $520.2 million. The weighted average risk grade for commercial real estate loans increased to 7.32 at December 31, 2020 from 7.07 at December 31, 2019. Commercial real estate loans graded as &#8220;watch&#8221; and &#8220;special mention&#8221; increased $390.8 million while classified commercial real estate loans increased $72.9 million. 

As noted above our credit loss models utilized the economic forecasts in the Moody&#8217;s BL Baseline Scenario for December 2020 for our estimate of expected credit losses as of December 31, 2020. We qualitatively adjust the model results based on this scenario for various risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. These Q-Factor adjustments are discussed below. 

Q-Factor adjustments are based upon management judgment and current assessment as to the impact of risks related to changes in lending policies and procedures; economic and business conditions; loan portfolio attributes and credit concentrations; and external factors, among other things, that are not already captured within the modeling inputs, assumptions and other processes. Management assesses the potential impact of such items within a range of severely negative impact to positive impact and adjusts the modeled expected credit loss by an aggregate adjustment percentage based upon the assessment. As a result of this assessment as of December 31, 2020, modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weighted-average Q-Factor adjustment of approximately 1.2%, and decreasing from 12.9% upon the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020 (as further discussed below). The weighted-average Q-Factor adjustment at December 31, 2020 was based on a positive expected impact related to changes in lending policies, procedures and underwriting standards; a limited negative expected impact associated with changes in loan portfolio attributes and concentrations, changes in risk grades, changes in the volumes and severity of loan delinquencies and adverse classifications and potential deterioration of collateral values; and a severely negative impact from other risk factors associated with our commercial real estate construction and land loan portfolios, particularly the risks related to expected extensions. 

In connection with our assessment of Q-Factor adjustments for our initial estimate of expected credit losses upon the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weighted-average Q-Factor adjustment of approximately 12.9%, which included a 10% upward adjustment to modeled expected credit losses related to risks associated with model uncertainty. This adjustment was based upon the results of certain back testing procedures performed on our credit loss models. The Q-Factor adjustment as of December 31, 2020 did not include this additional 10% upward adjustment related to risks associated with model uncertainty. While management believed the 10% adjustment was appropriate given the economic environment prevailing as of January 1, 2020, as of December 31, 2020, in consideration of the current economic conditions, management determined it was more appropriate to apply overlays to certain individual portfolios based upon analysis and management judgement. 

Management also made certain other qualitative adjustments for loans within certain industries that are expected to be more significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price volatility and declines as described below. 

In early March 2020, Saudi Arabia announced significant price discounts on oil which resulted in a sharp decrease in global oil prices including the benchmark WTI. Saudi Arabia further announced that it would significantly increase its production leading Russia to respond in kind. These actions arose in the face of increasing global supplies and decreasing global demand. The subsequent worsening global economic outlook and decreased demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in further decreases in energy prices. The WTI price per barrel of crude oil was approximately $48 as of December 31, 2020 up from $20 per barrel as of March 31, 2020 but still down from approximately $61 per barrel as of December 31, 2019. In late March 2020, we established a special Energy Oversight Council to oversee and assess the credit quality of our energy loan portfolio. 

As of December 31, 2020, we provided an additional qualitative adjustment for our energy loan portfolio. This adjustment was estimated based on borrowing base determinations for our energy production loans using current engineering valuations and a projected oil price deck of $36 for 2021 and increasing to $40 for 2022. We also perform an analysis of our customers' secondary sources of capital. Through this process at December 31, 2020, we estimated an aggregate borrowing base deficiency on energy production loans totaling approximately $31.8 million. Management believes that the aggregate borrowing base deficiency amount should serve as the appropriate level of expected credit losses for energy production loans. Accordingly, this resulted in an additional qualitative adjustment of $21.1 million for energy production loans at December 31, 2020. 

We performed a separate assessment of other energy loans which are primarily made up of borrowers associated with oilfield services such as transportation and logistics; equipment manufacturing and other services, among other things. Business activity among oilfield service firms experienced significant contraction during the latter part of the first quarter and through the third quarter. Business activity increased in the fourth quarter; however, capital expenditures among oilfield service firms remain depressed. There has been a significant decrease in the number of active oil rigs in Texas since March 2020, though the rate of decline in utilization slowed considerably by the third quarter of 2020 relative to the second quarter and the utilization rate saw positive improvement in the fourth quarter of 2020. While operating margins within the oilfield services sector have continued to decline, the outlook is starting to show improvement. Based on the level of modeled expected credit losses for this portfolio and the expectation of more stabilized conditions with regard to business activity related to oilfield services, we determined that no additional qualitative adjustment for non-production energy loans was necessary as of December 31, 2020. 

In late June 2020, we established a special Commercial Real Estate Oversight Council to oversee and assess the credit quality of our non-owner occupied and construction commercial real estate loan portfolios. Due to the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, management believes these portfolios have an elevated level of risk that requires a higher level of oversight, particularly as it relates to monitoring risk grades, payment deferrals, covenant modifications and structuring issues, among other things. 

In estimating current expected credit losses as of December 31, 2020, we determined that our credit loss models for our owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio were overly sensitive to the volatility of the forecasted Texas unemployment rate and the forecasted U.S. GDP. The modeled loss rate for this portfolio was significantly higher than the modeled loss rate for our commercial and industrial loan portfolio. Management believes that the loss rates for our owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio and our commercial and industrial loan portfolio should be similar due to the fact that that the loans within both portfolios are underwritten with the assumption that the primary repayment source is the cash flow from the operations of the borrower. This differs from non-owner occupied real estate where the primary repayment source is the cash flow generated by the underlying real estate being financed. Furthermore, our owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio and our commercial and industrial loan portfolio have a similar customer base. The loans within our owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio generally have a longer term than the loans within our commercial and industrial loan portfolio, which increases the modeled loss rate of the portfolio, despite the fact that this portfolio generally experiences lower losses in the case of default due to higher collateral valuations relative to the amount of the underlying loans. In light of the foregoing, management reduced the modeled loss allocation for owner occupied commercial real estate loans by $42.1 million as of December 31, 2020. Of this amount, $4.8 million was reallocated to the non-owner occupied commercial real estate and commercial real estate construction loan portfolios. Additional qualitative adjustments were made for these portfolios as we believe our borrowers' ability to access the capital markets for the sale or refinancing of assets, including those under construction, may be impaired 

for a significant amount of time. This would require secondary sources of capital and liquidity to support completed projects, access to which may take considerably longer to stabilize than was expected at the time the loans to these borrowers were originally underwritten. Additionally, management reallocated an additional $44.9 million for specific industries within the commercial real estate loan portfolio and $2.2 million for these specific industries within our commercial and industrial loan portfolio that have been particularly impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as further discussed below. The net effect of these additional qualitative adjustments, when combined with the aforementioned 1.2% weighted-average Q-Factor adjustment, was an overall negative qualitative adjustment to the allowance for credit losses on commercial real estate loans totaling $9.3 million. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout the State of Texas as well as nationally. Efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 have led to the closure of non-essential businesses, travel restrictions, supply chain disruptions and prohibitions on public gatherings, among other things, throughout many parts of the United States and, in particular, the markets in which we operate. Aside from the energy industry, which is discussed above, we lend to customers operating in certain other industries that have been, and are expected to be, more significantly impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These industries are presented in the following table and include amounts reported as both commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans while PPP loans are excluded.

We are continuing to monitor customers in these industries closely. In assessing these portfolios for an additional qualitative adjustment as of December 31, 2020, we performed a comprehensive review of the financial condition and overall outlook of the borrowers within these portfolios. Based on this analysis, we determined that there continues to be an elevated level of risk due to state and nationwide restrictions impacting each of these industries. As a result, we provided an additional qualitative adjustment of $47.1 million, which, for the most part, was allocated to commercial real estate loans.

Credit loss expense related to loans increased $203.3 million, or 602.1%, in 2020 compared to 2019. Credit loss expense related to loans during 2020 primarily reflects the increase in expected credit losses resulting from a deterioration in forecasted economic conditions and the current and uncertain future impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and recent volatility in oil prices. Credit loss expense also reflects the level of net charge-offs, the deterioration of credit quality and other changes within the loan portfolio during 2020. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was 1.51% (1.75% excluding PPP loans) at December 31, 2020 compared to 0.90% at December 31, 2019. Management believes the recorded amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans is appropriate based upon management&#8217;s best estimate of current expected credit losses within the existing portfolio of loans. Should any of the factors considered by management in making this estimate change, our estimate of current expect credit losses could also change, which could affect the level of future credit loss expense related to loans. 

Allowance for Credit Losses - Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures. Upon the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures estimated using the CECL methodology increased $39.4 million compared to the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures estimated as of December 31, 2019 using the prior incurred loss model. The increase reflects the impact of assuming portions of all of these commitments will fund in the future and applying our credit loss modeling processes to such amounts as if such amounts were funded loans. Previously, we only recognized a liability for estimated incurred credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures when the borrowers to which such commitments were extended exceeded certain risk grades and had not violated any underlying covenants that would relieve us of any obligation to fund additional amounts under the commitment. Subsequent to the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, we recognized credit loss expense related to off-balance-sheet credit exposures totaling $4.3 million during 2020 to increase the amount of the related allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures to $44.2 million as of December 31, 2020. The increase primarily reflects changes in underlying risk grades and expected utilization of available funds, an increase in overall off-balance-sheet credit exposures and a deterioration in forecasted economic conditions and the current and uncertain future impacts associated with COVID-19. Further information regarding our policies and methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is presented in Note 8 - Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements, Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.

Securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Securities are classified as available for sale when they might be sold before maturity. Securities available for sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income, net of tax. The remaining securities are classified as trading. Trading 

securities are held primarily for sale in the near term and are carried at their fair values, with unrealized gains and losses included immediately in other income. Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase. Securities with limited marketability, such as stock in the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank, are carried at cost. 

All mortgage-backed securities included in the above tables were issued by U.S. government agencies and corporations. At December 31, 2020, all of the securities in our municipal bond portfolio were issued by the State of Texas or political subdivisions or agencies within the State of Texas, of which approximately 78.2% are either guaranteed by the Texas Permanent School Fund, which has a &#8220;triple-A&#8221; insurer financial strength rating, or secured by U.S. Treasury securities via defeasance of the debt by the issuers. At December 31, 2020, we held general obligation bonds issued by the State of Texas with an aggregate amortized cost of $1.0 billion and an aggregate fair value of $1.1 billion. Such amounts were in excess of 10% of our shareholders&#8217; equity at December 31, 2020. At such date, all of these securities were considered "high grade" or better by various credit rating agencies. At December 31, 2020, there were no other holdings of any one issuer, other than the U.S. government and its agencies, in an amount greater than 10% of our shareholders&#8217; equity. 

The average taxable-equivalent yield on the securities portfolio based on a 21% tax rate was 3.46% in 2020 compared to 3.40% in 2019. Tax-exempt municipal securities totaled 66.6% of average securities in 2020 compared to 62.0% in 2019. The average yield on taxable securities was 2.27% in 2020 compared to 2.33% in 2019, while the average taxable-equivalent yield on tax-exempt securities was 4.08% in 2020 compared to 4.06% in 2019. See the section captioned &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion. 

Deposits 

The table below presents the daily average balances of deposits by type and weighted-average rates paid thereon during the years presented: 

##TABLE_START 2020 2019 2018 Average Balance Average Rate Paid Average Balance Average Rate Paid Average Balance Average Rate Paid Non-interest-bearing demand deposits: Commercial and individual $ 12,782,723 $ 9,829,635 $ 10,164,396 Correspondent banks 243,856 213,442 205,727 Public funds 537,117 315,339 386,685 Total 13,563,696 10,358,416 10,756,808 Interest-bearing deposits: Private accounts: Savings and interest checking 7,782,352 0.02 % 6,777,473 0.07 % 6,667,695 0.08 % Money market accounts 8,387,903 0.18 7,738,654 0.93 7,645,624 0.77 Time accounts 1,120,060 1.25 989,907 1.65 800,096 0.81 Public funds 584,261 0.26 548,827 1.31 418,843 1.04 Total 17,874,576 0.18 16,054,861 0.62 15,532,258 0.49 Total deposits $ 31,438,272 0.10 $ 26,413,277 0.38 $ 26,289,066 0.29 ##TABLE_END

Average deposits increased $5.0 billion, or 19.0%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The most significant volume growth during 2020 compared to 2019 was in non-interest bearing commercial and individual deposits; savings and interest checking; and money market deposits while all other categories of deposits experienced increases in volume but to a lesser extent. The ratio of average interest-bearing deposits to total average deposits was 56.9% in 2020 compared to 60.8% in 2019. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits and total deposits was 0.18% and 0.10% during 2020 compared to 0.62% and 0.38% during 2019. The decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits in 2020 as compared to 2019 was related to lower average interest rates paid on most of our interest-bearing deposit products as a result of lower average market interest rates. 

The following table presents the proportion of each component of average non-interest-bearing deposits to the total of such non-interest-bearing deposits during the years presented: 

##TABLE_START 2020 2019 2018 Commercial and individual 94.2 % 94.9 % 94.5 % Correspondent banks 1.8 2.1 1.9 Public funds 4.0 3.0 3.6 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % ##TABLE_END

Average non-interest-bearing deposits increased $3.2 billion, or 30.9%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $3.0 billion, or 30.0%, increase in average commercial and individual deposits, a $221.8 million, or 70.3%, increase in average public fund deposits and a $30.4 million, or 14.2%, increase in average correspondent bank deposits. 

The following table presents the proportion of each component of average interest-bearing deposits to the total of such interest-bearing deposits during the years presented:

Total average interest-bearing deposits increased $1.8 billion, or 11.3%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a $1.0 billion, or 14.8%, increase in average savings and interest checking deposits, a $649.2 million, or 8.4%, increase in average money market deposits, a $130.2 million, or 13.1%, increase in average time deposits and a $35.4 million, or 6.5%, increase in average public funds deposits. 

From time to time, we have obtained interest-bearing deposits through brokered transactions including participation in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (&#8220;CDARS&#8221;). Brokered deposits were not significant during the reported periods. 

Geographic Concentrations . The following table summarizes our average total deposit portfolio, as segregated by the geographic region from which the deposit accounts were originated. Certain accounts, such as correspondent bank deposits and deposits allocated to certain statewide operational units, are recorded at the statewide level.

Foreign Deposits. Mexico has historically been considered a part of the natural trade territory of our banking offices. Accordingly, U.S. dollar-denominated foreign deposits from sources within Mexico have traditionally been a significant source of funding. Average deposits from foreign sources, primarily Mexico, totaled $824.9 million in 2020 and $774.0 million in 2019. 

Short-Term Borrowings 

Our primary source of short-term borrowings is federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and repurchase agreements in our natural trade territory, as well as from upstream banks. Federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements totaled $2.1 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The maximum amount of these borrowings outstanding at any month-end was $2.1 billion in 2020, $1.7 billion in 2019 and $1.4 billion in 2018. The weighted-average interest rate on federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements was 0.05% at December 31, 2020, 0.81% at December 31, 2019 and 1.33% at December 31, 2018. 

The following table presents our average net funding position during the years indicated:

The net funds purchased position increased $332.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Average interest-bearing deposits (primarily excess reserves held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) totaled $5.3 billion in 2020 compared to $1.6 billion in 2019 and $3.0 billion in 2018. During the reported periods, we have maintained excess liquid funds in interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve rather than federal funds sold. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Commitments, Guarantees, and Contractual Obligations 

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2020. Payments for borrowings do not include interest. Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts. Loan commitments and standby letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts; however, since many of these commitments are expected to expire unused or only partially used, the total amounts of these commitments do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements.

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk. In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. We minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. We also hold certain assets which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets including assets held in fiduciary or custodial capacity on behalf of our trust customers. 

Commitments to Extend Credit. We enter into contractual commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding. Commitments to extend credit outstanding at December 31, 2020 are included in the table above. 

Standby Letters of Credit. Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. In the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer. Our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements. Standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2020 are included in the table above. 

Trust Accounts . We also hold certain assets in fiduciary or custodial capacity on behalf of our trust customers. The estimated fair value of trust assets was approximately $38.6 billion (including managed assets of $16.9 billion and custody assets of $21.7 billion) at December 31, 2020. These assets were primarily composed of equity securities (52.1% of trust assets), fixed income securities (32.7% of trust assets) and cash equivalents (9.9% of trust assets). 

Capital and Liquidity 

Capital . Shareholders&#8217; equity totaled $4.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2019. In addition to net income of $331.2 million, other sources of capital during 2020 included other comprehensive income, net of tax, of $245.6 million, $145.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock, $12.6 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and $13.9 million related to stock-based compensation. Uses of capital during 2020 included $182.6 million of dividends paid on preferred and common stock, a $150.0 million redemption of Series A Preferred Stock, $15.8 million of treasury stock purchases and $29.3 million related to the cumulative effect of a new accounting principle adopted during the first quarter of 2020. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 

The accumulated other comprehensive income/loss component of shareholders&#8217; equity totaled a net, after-tax, unrealized gain of $513.0 million at December 31, 2020 compared to a net, after-tax, unrealized gain $267.4 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $250.5 million net, after-tax, increase in the net unrealized gain on securities available for sale and securities transferred to held to maturity. 

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, we elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital. Accordingly, amounts reported as accumulated other comprehensive income/loss related to securities available for sale, effective cash flow hedges and defined benefit post-retirement benefit plans do not increase or reduce regulatory capital and are not included in the calculation of risk-based capital and leverage ratios. In connection with the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, we also elected to exclude, for a transitional period, the effects of credit loss accounting under CECL in the calculation of our regulatory capital and regulatory capital ratios. Regulatory agencies for banks and bank holding companies utilize capital guidelines designed to measure capital and take into consideration the risk inherent in both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. See Note 9 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. 

We paid quarterly dividends of $0.71, $0.71, $0.71 and $0.72 per common share during the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively, and quarterly dividends of $0.67, $0.71, $0.71 and $0.71 per common share during the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2019, respectively. This equates to a dividend payout ratio of 55.8% in 2020 and 40.6% in 2019. Under the terms of the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures that Cullen/Frost has issued to Cullen/Frost Capital Trust II and WNB Capital Trust I, we have the right at any time during the term of the debentures to defer the payment of interest any time or from time to time for an extension period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarterly periods with respect to each extension period. Our ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our capital stock is subject to certain restrictions during any such extension period. 

Preferred Stock . On March 16, 2020, we redeemed all 6,000,000 shares of our 5.375% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, (&#8220;Series A Preferred Stock&#8221;) at a redemption price of $25 per share, or an aggregate redemption of $150.0 million. When issued, the net proceeds of the Series A Preferred Stock totaled $144.5 million after deducting $5.5 million of issuance costs including the underwriting discount and professional service fees, among other things. Upon redemption, these issuance costs were reclassified to retained earnings and reported as a reduction of net income available to common shareholders. 

On November 19, 2020 we issued 150,000 shares, or $150.0 million in aggregate liquidation preference, of our 4.450% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, par value $0.01 and liquidation preference $1,000 per share (&#8220;Series B Preferred Stock&#8221;). Each share of Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding is represented by 40 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of the Series B Preferred Stock (equivalent to a liquidation preference of $25 per share). Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, if declared, accrue and are payable quarterly, in arrears, at a rate of 4.450% per annum. The net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the depositary shares representing the Series B Preferred Stock, after deducting underwriting discount and commissions, and the payment of expenses, were approximately $145.5 million. Under the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, in the event that we do not declare and pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for the most recent dividend period, we may not, with certain exceptions, declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock or any of our securities that rank junior to the Series B Preferred Stock. See Note 9 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. 

Stock Repurchase Plans. From time to time, our board of directors has authorized stock repurchase plans. In general, stock repurchase plans allow us to proactively manage our capital position and return excess capital to shareholders. Shares purchased under such plans also provide us with shares of common stock necessary to satisfy obligations related to stock compensation awards. On July 24, 2019, our board of directors authorized a $100.0 million stock repurchase program, allowing us to repurchase shares of our common stock over a one-year period from time to time at various prices in the open market or through private transactions. Under this plan, we repurchased 177,834 shares at a total cost of $13.7 million during 2020 and 202,724 shares at a total cost of $17.2 million during 2019. Under prior stock repurchase programs, we repurchased 496,307 shares at a total cost of $50.0 million during 2019. See Part II, Item 5 - Market for Registrant&#8217;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, elsewhere in this report. 

Liquidity . Liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due. The liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities. The ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure, its ability to liquidate assets and its access to alternative sources of funds. The objective of our liquidity management is to manage cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund our operations and to meet obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. We seek to achieve this objective and ensure that funding needs are met by maintaining an appropriate level of liquid funds through asset/liability management, which includes managing the mix and time to maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities on our balance sheet. Our liquidity position is enhanced by our ability to raise additional funds as needed in the wholesale markets. 

Asset liquidity is provided by liquid assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits in banks, securities available for sale, maturities and cash flow from securities held to maturity, and federal funds sold and resell agreements. 

Liability liquidity is provided by access to funding sources which include core deposits and correspondent banks in our natural trade area that maintain accounts with and sell federal funds to Frost Bank, as well as federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements from upstream banks and deposits obtained through financial intermediaries. 

Our liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Liquidity risk management is an important element in our asset/liability management process. We regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions, volatility in the financial markets, unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management. These scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan, which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $9.7 billion held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve. We also have the ability to borrow funds as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;). As of December 31, 2020, based upon 

available, pledgeable collateral, our total borrowing capacity with the FHLB was approximately $2.9 billion. Furthermore, at December 31, 2020, we had approximately $7.3 billion in securities that were unencumbered by a pledge and could be used to support additional borrowings through repurchase agreements or the Federal Reserve discount window, as needed. As of December 31, 2020, management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources or operations. In addition, management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity that would have a material adverse effect on us. 

Since Cullen/Frost is a holding company and does not conduct operations, its primary sources of liquidity are dividends upstreamed from Frost Bank and borrowings from outside sources. Banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by Frost Bank. See Note 9 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report regarding such dividends. At December 31, 2020, Cullen/Frost had liquid assets, including cash and resell agreements, totaling $381.2 million. 

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 

Our financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). GAAP presently requires us to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historic dollars. Changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered. The primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. In management&#8217;s opinion, changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including changes in the expected rate of inflation, the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities, among other things, as further discussed in the next section. 

Regulatory and Economic Policies 

Our business and earnings are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities, among other things. The Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions. Among the instruments of monetary policy historically available to the Federal Reserve Board are (i) conducting open market operations in United States government obligations, (ii) changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings, (iii) imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits, and (iv) restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by financial institutions and their affiliates. These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to affect directly the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. For that reason alone, the policies of the Federal Reserve Board have a material effect on our earnings. 

Governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future; however, we cannot accurately predict the nature, timing or extent of any effect such policies may have on our future business and earnings. 

Accounting Standards Updates 

See Note 20 - Accounting Standards Updates in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our financial statements.
