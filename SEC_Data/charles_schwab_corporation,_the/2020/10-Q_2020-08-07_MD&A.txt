 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

INTRODUCTION 

The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC) is a savings and loan holding company and engages, through its subsidiaries, in wealth management, securities brokerage, banking, asset management, custody, and financial advisory services. 

Principal business subsidiaries of CSC include the following: 

&#8226; 

Charles Schwab &#38; Co., Inc. (CS&#38;Co), a securities broker-dealer; 

&#8226; 

Charles Schwab Bank, SSB (CSB), our principal banking entity; and 

&#8226; 

Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (CSIM), the investment advisor for Schwab&#8217;s proprietary mutual funds (Schwab Funds &#174; ) and for Schwab&#8217;s exchange-traded funds (Schwab ETFs&#8482;). 

Unless otherwise indicated, the terms &#8220;Schwab,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; mean CSC together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 

Schwab provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments &#8211; Investor Services and Advisor Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors, and retirement plan services, as well as other corporate brokerage services, to businesses and their employees. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking, and support services, as well as retirement business services, to independent registered investment advisors (RIAs), independent retirement advisors, and recordkeepers. 

Schwab was founded on the belief that all Americans deserve access to a better investing experience. Although much has changed in the intervening years, our purpose remains clear &#8211; to champion every client&#8217;s goals with passion and integrity. Guided by this purpose and our vision of creating the most trusted leader in investment services, management has adopted a strategy described as &#8220;Through Clients&#8217; Eyes.&#8221; 

This strategy emphasizes placing clients&#8217; perspectives, needs, and desires at the forefront. Because investing plays a fundamental role in building financial security, we strive to deliver a better investing experience for our clients &#8211; individual investors and the people and institutions who serve them &#8211; by disrupting longstanding industry practices on their behalf and providing superior service. We also aim to offer a broad range of products and solutions to meet client needs with a focus on transparency, value, and trust. In addition, management works to couple Schwab&#8217;s scale and resources with ongoing expense discipline to keep costs low and ensure that products and solutions are affordable as well as responsive to client needs. In combination, these are the key elements of our &#8220;no trade-offs&#8221; approach to serving investors. We believe that following this strategy is the best way to maximize our market valuation and stockholder returns over time. 

Management estimates that investable wealth in the United States (U.S.) (consisting of assets in defined contribution, retail wealth management and brokerage, and registered investment advisor channels, along with bank deposits) currently exceeds $45 trillion, which means the Company&#8217;s $4.11 trillion in client assets leaves substantial opportunity for growth. Our strategy is based on the principle that developing trusted relationships will translate into more assets from both new and existing clients, ultimately driving more revenue, and along with expense discipline and thoughtful capital management, will generate earnings growth and build long-term stockholder value. 

This Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 ( 2019 Form 10-K). 

On our website, https://www.aboutschwab.com , we post the following filings after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

N/M Not meaningful. 

During the second quarter and first half of 2020, the ongoing health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects continued to dominate the macroeconomic environment, resulting in a contracting U.S. economy, and sustained pressures on interest rates. Throughout this challenging time, the Company continued to operate without significant client disruption, and we continued to move forward on important operating initiatives, including multiple acquisitions. Schwab&#8217;s focus on clients remains, even as almost 95% of our employees continued to work remotely throughout the second quarter. 

During the second quarter of 2020, we gathered $137.4 billion in net new assets, with core net new assets totaling $46.6 billion before including the effects of the USAA-IMCO acquisition and a large mutual fund clearing inflow. Aided by ongoing client engagement and an extended tax-filing season, our year-to-date core net new assets reached $119.8 billion, representing a 6%

annualized organic growth rate. Strong client trading activity continued during the second quarter, as daily average trades were 1.6 million in both the second quarter and first half of 2020, up 126% and 112%, respectively, from the same periods in 2019. Active brokerage accounts grew 18% from June 30, 2019 and totaled 14.1 million at June 30, 2020, inclusive of 1.1 million USAA accounts added to our platform upon closing in May of 2020. Growth in equity market valuations during the second quarter, along with our ongoing asset-gathering and approximately $80 billion in client assets transferred from USAA, helped push total client assets to $4.11 trillion at June 30, 2020, up 11% from June 30, 2019. 

Schwab&#8217;s net income totaled $671 million and $1.5 billion in the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, representing decreases of 28% and 23% from the comparable periods in the prior year. Diluted earnings per common share (EPS) in the second quarter and first half of 2020 were $.48 and $1.07, respectively, declining 27% and 21% from the same periods in 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS (1) , which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and related income tax effects, were $.54 and $1.14 for the second quarter and first six months of 2020, respectively, down from $.67 and $1.36 from the same periods in the prior year. 

Total net revenues were $2.5 billion and $5.1 billion in the second quarter and first half of 2020, declining 9% and 6%, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2019, due primarily to lower net interest revenue. Lower net investment yields driven by the Federal Reserve&#8217;s dramatic monetary easing in 2020 outweighed growth in client cash balances held at our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, which led to declines in net interest revenue of 14% and 10% in the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2019. Asset management and administration fees grew to $801 million and $1.6 billion for the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, representing growth of 2% and 6% relative to the same periods in 2019. These increases were due primarily to clients&#8217; higher balances of money market funds and advice solutions, partially offset by the effect of money market fund fee waivers due to declining portfolio yields, lower Mutual Fund OneSource &#174; balances, and lower equity market valuations in the first quarter and beginning of the second quarter of 2020. Trading revenue declined 7% and 10% during the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, compared with the same periods in the prior year, as our October 2019 pricing actions more than offset a significant increase in trading volume in 2020. 

Total expenses excluding interest were $1.6 billion and $3.1 billion during the second quarter and first half of 2020, representing increases of 8% for both periods relative to the comparable periods in 2019. Our expenses included acquisition and integration-related costs related to our completed and pending acquisitions discussed below of $81 million and $118 million during the second quarter and first six months of 2020, respectively. Adjusted total expenses (1) , which exclude acquisition and integration-related costs as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets, were $1.5 billion and $3.0 billion during the second quarter and first six months of 2020, respectively, representing increases of 2% and 4%, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2019. 

During the first six months of 2020, we remained intent on maintaining a balance sheet with healthy liquidity and capital levels. The sharp pandemic-driven increase in client cash during the first quarter of 2020 was followed by more modest balance sheet expansion during the second quarter, and after adding approximately $10 billion of client cash held at our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries from our acquisition of USAA-IMCO, we ended the second quarter with total assets of $400 billion, up 8% from March 31 and up 36% from December 31, 2019. During the second quarter, we issued $2.5 billion of preferred stock, Series G, at an initial fixed rate of 5.375%, bringing total preferred stock to $5.3 billion, or approximately 24% of Tier 1 Capital at June 30, 2020, and the Company ended the second quarter with a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 5.9%. 

Return on average common stockholders&#8217; equity was 10% and 12% for the second quarter and first six months of 2020, down from 19% and 20% for the comparable periods in 2019. Return on tangible common equity (1) was 12% and 15% for the second quarter and first six months of 2020, down from 21% and 22% for the comparable periods in 2019. The decreases in both return on average common stockholders&#8217; equity and return on tangible common equity were due primarily to lower net income and an increase in average accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) due to unrealized gains in our available for sale (AFS) investment securities portfolio. Return on tangible common equity represents annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders (1) as a percentage of average tangible common equity (1) . Adjusted net income available to common stockholders excludes acquisition and integration-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and related income tax effects. Tangible common equity excludes goodwill, acquired intangible assets, and related deferred tax liabilities. 

(1) Adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted total expenses, adjusted net income available to common stockholders, and return on tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results.

Business and Asset Acquisitions 

During the second quarter of 2020 we made significant progress towards closing our pending acquisition of TD Ameritrade, with the completion of the Department of Justice antitrust review and affirmative votes by both Schwab and TD Ameritrade stockholders. Integration planning efforts are continuing and we remain on track for closing our acquisition of TD Ameritrade during the second half of 2020. 

On May 26, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of the assets of USAA-IMCO for $1.6 billion in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments. Along with the asset purchase agreement, the companies entered into a long-term referral agreement that makes Schwab the exclusive provider of wealth management and investment brokerage services for USAA members. The USAA-IMCO acquisition adds scale to the Company&#8217;s operations through the addition of 1.1 million brokerage and managed portfolio accounts with approximately $80 billion in client assets at the acquisition date. The transaction also provides Schwab the opportunity to further expand our client base by serving USAA&#8217;s members through the long-term referral agreement. See Item 1 &#8211; Note 3 for more information on the USAA-IMCO acquisition. 

Additionally, during the second quarter of 2020 the Company completed its acquisition of technology and intellectual property of Motif, a financial technology company. The Motif assets will help us build on our existing capabilities and help accelerate our development of thematic and direct index investing for Schwab&#8217;s retail investors and RIA clients. On July 1, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of Wasmer, Schroeder &#38; Company, LLC, which will add established strategies and new separately managed account offerings to our existing fixed income lineup. 

Current Regulatory Environment and Other Developments 

Effective March 20, 2020, CSB and Charles Schwab Premier Bank, SSB (CSPB) converted to Texas-chartered state savings banks. CSB and CSPB became members of the Federal Reserve and are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve and the Texas Department of Savings and Mortgage Lending.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

Net Interest Revenue 

Revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and loans, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and loans. 

Late in the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds target overnight rate twice, for a total of 150 basis points to near zero; on the longer-end of the curve, the 10-year Treasury rate declined by over 120 basis points. Lower interest rates across maturities persisted throughout the second quarter, while credit spreads also compressed. Moreover, changes in the economic environment throughout the first half of 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic drove significantly higher levels of client cash sweep balances. Given the rapid accumulation of these balances in the first quarter of 2020, the Company initially placed a substantial amount in excess reserves held at the Federal Reserve. The Company deployed a significant amount of this cash build-up during the second quarter, as part of AFS securities purchases totaling $73.9 billion. These purchases were made at rates below the average yield on the existing AFS portfolio due to the current low interest rate environment. The Company held $27.5 billion, or 9% of total deposits, in excess reserves at June 30, 2020, versus our longer-term objective of 5-7%.

(1) Interest revenue or expense was less than $500,000 in the period or periods presented. 

(2) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost. 

(3) On January 1, 2020, the Company transferred all of its investment securities designated as held to maturity (HTM) to the AFS category, as described in Note 5. 

Net interest revenue decreased $220 million , or 14% , and $329 million , or 10% in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 , due primarily to lower average investment yields partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets. Accelerated premium amortization on debt securities in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 also contributed to the reduction in net interest revenue, as the decline in long-term interest rates in the first half of 2020 resulted in higher prepayments of mortgage-related debt securities. 

Average interest-earning assets for the second quarter and first six months of 2020 were higher by 37% and 22% , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019 . These increases in average interest-earning assets were primarily driven by higher client cash balances in bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients. 

Our net interest margin was 1.53% and 1.80% during the second quarter and first six months of 2020 , respectively, down from 2.40% and 2.43% , during the same periods in 2019 . This decrease was driven primarily by lower yields received on interest-earning assets due largely to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s 2019 and 2020 interest rate decreases. The amount of any further net interest margin compression and resulting net interest revenue is dependent on a number of factors, including the timing of investing cash into higher yielding assets, changes to LIBOR, and the level of client cash balances.

(1) Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, Schwab ETF OneSource&#8482; was discontinued as a result of the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed ETFs. 

(2) Average client assets for advice solutions may also include the asset balances contained in the mutual fund and/or ETF categories listed above. 

(3) Includes various asset-related fees, such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, and mutual fund clearing fees and other service fees. 

(4) Includes miscellaneous service and transaction fees relating to mutual funds and ETFs that are not balance-based. 

Asset management and administration fees increased by $15 million , or 2% , and $87 million , or 6% in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019 . These increases were primarily driven by higher balances in purchased money market funds and advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA, in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 relative to the same periods in 2019. These increases were partially offset by the effect of money market fund fee waivers due to declining portfolio yields, lower Mutual Fund OneSource &#174; balances, and lower equity market valuations in the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter of 2020. The amount of fee waivers in coming

quarters is dependent on a variety of factors, including the level of short-term interest rates and client preferences across our money market fund line-up. 

The following tables present a roll forward of client assets for the Schwab money market funds, Schwab equity and bond funds, ETFs, and CTFs, and Mutual Fund OneSource and other non-transaction fee (NTF) funds.

Note: 

Effective October 7, 2019, CS&#38;Co eliminated online trade commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options. 

(1) 

Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, order flow revenue was reclassified from other revenue to trading revenue. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change. 

(2) 

Revenue per trade is calculated as trading revenue divided by DATs multiplied by the number of trading days. 

Trading revenue decreased $14 million , or 7% , and $43 million , or 10% , in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 , due primarily to our 2019 pricing actions, which more than offset a significant increase in clients&#8217; daily average trades and higher order flow revenue. Order flow revenue was $72 million and $33 million during the second quarters of 2020 and 2019 , and $127 million and $65 million during the first six months of 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The increases in order flow revenue during the second quarter and first six months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 were due to a higher volume of trades. 

Other Revenue 

Other revenue includes certain service fees, software fees, exchange processing fees, and non-recurring gains. Other revenue decreased $12 million , or 15% , and $52 million , or 35% in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 , respectively,

compared to the same periods in 2019 . These decreases were primarily driven by a gain from the sale of a portfolio management and reporting software solution for advisors to Tamarac Inc. recognized in the second quarter of 2019, a gain from the assignment of leased office space recognized in the first quarter of 2019, and an increase in the allowance for credit losses on bank loans in the first quarter of 2020.

Expenses excluding interest increased by 8% in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 . Adjusted total expenses, excluding acquisition and integration-related costs, and amortization of acquired intangible assets, increased 2% and 4% in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 , respectively. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results. 

Total compensation and benefits increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 , primarily due to an increase in employee headcount to support our expanding client base, including approximately 400 former USAA employees hired in connection with the USAA-IMCO acquisition, partially offset by a lower corporate bonus accrual. The year-to-date increase also reflected the Company&#8217;s payment of $1,000 to all non-officer employees in March 2020 to help them cover costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Professional services expense increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 , primarily due to expenses relating to our completed and pending acquisitions. 

Occupancy and equipment expense increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 , primarily due to an increase in technology equipment costs associated with higher customer trade volumes. 

Communications expense increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 , primarily due to higher customer trade volumes as well as overall growth in our business and client base. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses grew in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 , primarily due to higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software, higher depreciation of buildings

and equipment related to expansion of our campuses in the U.S. in 2019 and 2020, as well as higher amortization of acquired intangible assets due to acquisitions completed in the second quarter of 2020. 

Other expenses increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 , primarily resulting from acquisition and integration-related costs and increases in processing fees and related expenses due to higher customer trade volumes and market volatility. These increases were partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expense. 

Capital expenditures were $169 million and $419 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 , respectively compared with $173 million and $354 million in the second quarter of 2019, respectively. The year to date increase in capital expenditures from the prior year was primarily due to higher capitalized software costs, partially offset by lower building expansion in 2020 relative to the first six months of 2019. Excluding any potential impact of the pending acquisition of TD Ameritrade, we anticipate capital expenditures for full-year 2020 to be approximately 5-6% of total net revenues. 

Taxes on Income 

Taxes on income were $217 million and $299 million for the second quarters of 2020 and 2019 , respectively, resulting in effective income tax rates on income before taxes of 24.4% and 24.2% , respectively. Taxes on income were $469 million and $599 million for the first six months of 2020 and 2019, respectively, resulting in effective income tax rates on income before taxes of 24.2% and 24.0% , respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 was due to an increase in nondeductible acquisition costs and FDIC insurance premium disallowance, as well as a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits. Partially offsetting the increase in the effective tax rate from these items was a lower effective state income tax rate and an increase in Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) benefits in the second quarter and first six months of 2020.

Investor Services 

Total net revenues decreased by 9% and 6% in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019 , primarily due to decreases in net interest revenue and trading revenue, partially offset by an increase in asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue decreased primarily due to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets. Trading revenue decreased primarily as a result of the Company&#8217;s 2019 pricing actions, which more than offset higher trading volume seen in the first six months of 2020. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to increased balances in purchased money market funds and advice solutions, partially offset by money market fund fee waivers due to declining portfolio yields, lower Mutual Fund OneSource &#174; balances, and lower equity market valuations in the first quarter and beginning of the second quarter of 2020.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

Expenses excluding interest increased by 11% and 10% in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019 , primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, depreciation and amortization, and other expenses. Compensation and benefits increased primarily due to increased headcount to support our expanding client base, including approximately 400 former USAA employees hired in connection with the USAA-IMCO acquisition, as well as the Company&#8217;s payment of $1,000 to all non-officer employees in March 2020 to help them cover costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a lower corporate bonus accrual. The professional services increase was driven primarily by expenses related to our completed and pending acquisitions and overall growth in the business. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased primarily due to technology equipment costs associated with higher customer trade volumes. Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software, higher depreciation of buildings and equipment related to our campus expansion, as well as higher amortization of acquired intangible assets due to acquisitions completed in the second quarter of 2020. Other expenses increased primarily due to increases in processing fees and related expenses due to higher customer trade volumes and market volatility, as well as acquisition and integration-related costs, partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expenses. 

Advisor Services 

Total net revenues decreased by 8% in both the second quarter and first six months of 2020 , compared to the same periods in 2019 , due to decreases in net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, trading revenue, and other revenue. Net interest revenue decreased primarily due to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets. Asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to lower Mutual Fund OneSource &#174; balances and lower equity market valuations in the first quarter and beginning of the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by increased balances in purchased money market funds. Trading revenue decreased primarily as a result of the Company&#8217;s 2019 pricing actions, partially offset by higher trading volume. The decrease in other revenue was primarily driven by a gain from the sale of a portfolio management and reporting software solution for advisors to Tamarac Inc. recognized in the second quarter of 2019, and a gain from the assignment of leased office space recognized in the first quarter of 2019. 

Expenses excluding interest increased by 2% and 3% in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019 , primarily due to higher professional services, occupancy and equipment expenses, and depreciation and amortization. The increase in professional services was driven by expenses related to our acquisitions and overall growth in the business. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased primarily due to technology equipment costs associated with higher customer trade volumes. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software, and higher depreciation of buildings and equipment related to expansion of our campuses in the U.S. in 2019 and 2020. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Schwab&#8217;s business activities expose us to a variety of risks, including operational, credit, market, liquidity, and compliance risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. For a discussion of our risk management programs, see Item 7 &#8211; Risk Management in the 2019 Form 10-K. 

Net Interest Revenue Simulation 

For our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulations include all interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, repricing of financial instruments, and reinvestment of matured or paid-down securities and loans. 

Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets primarily include investment securities, margin loans and bank loans. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. Because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans, and control the composition of our investment securities, we have some ability to manage our net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions. 

Net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next 12 months beginning June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period:

The change in net interest revenue sensitivities as of June 30, 2020 reflects a significantly lower interest rate curve from the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the global economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher short-term interest rates would positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interest earning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources. A decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the Company&#8217;s investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources, compressing net interest margin. 

In addition to measuring the effect of a gradual 100 basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates, we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel- and non-parallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue. 

Economic Value of Equity Simulation 

Management also uses economic value of equity (EVE) simulations to measure interest rate risk. EVE sensitivity measures the long-term impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment. Key assumptions in our EVE calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, term structure models of interest rates, non-maturity deposit behavior, and pricing assumptions. 

As a result of the low interest rate environment in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 , the downward assessments of our net interest revenue and EVE simulations as of June 30, 2020 reflected the assumption of non-negative investment yields. 

Expected Phase-out of LIBOR 

The Company has established a firm-wide team to address the likely discontinuation of LIBOR. As part of our efforts, we have assessed our LIBOR exposures, the largest of which are certain investment securities and loans. In purchasing new investment securities, we ensure that appropriate fall-back language is in the security&#8217;s prospectus in the event that LIBOR is unavailable or deemed unreliable, and we have sold certain securities lacking appropriate fall-back language. We are updating loan agreements to ensure new LIBOR-based loans adequately provide for an alternative to LIBOR. Furthermore, we plan to phase-out the use of LIBOR as a reference rate in our new lending products before December 2021. Consistent with our &#8220;Through Clients&#8217; Eyes&#8221; strategy, our focus throughout the LIBOR transition process is to ensure clients are treated fairly and consistently as this major change is occurring in the financial markets. The market transition process has not yet progressed to a point at which the impact to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements of LIBOR&#8217;s discontinuation can be estimated.

Liquidity Risk 

Funding Sources 

Schwab&#8217;s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients. 

Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, repurchase agreements, and cash provided by external financing. 

&#160; 

To meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments, including U.S. Treasury securities. 

In addition to internal sources of liquidity, Schwab has access to external funding. The following table describes external debt facilities available at June 30, 2020 : Description

CSC also has a universal automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, which enables it to issue debt, equity, and other securities. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

Pursuant to the 2019 interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, Schwab became subject to a reduced LCR rule requiring the Company to hold high quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to at least 85% of the Company&#8217;s projected net cash outflows over a prospective 30-calendar-day period of acute liquidity stress, calculated on each business day. See Part I &#8211; Item 1 &#8211; Regulation in the 2019 Form 10-K for additional information. The Company was in compliance with the reduced LCR rule at June 30, 2020 .

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

Schwab seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of our business strategy, including anticipated balance sheet growth, providing financial support to our subsidiaries, and sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to our banking subsidiaries. Schwab&#8217;s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets. To ensure that Schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios. 

As a result of the significant inflow of client cash in the first six months of 2020, our consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio declined from 7.3% at year-end 2019 to 5.9% at June 30, 2020 , below our long-term operating objective of 6.75%-7.00% but well above the regulatory minimum of 4.00%. The pace of our return to the long-term operating objective over time depends on a number of factors including the overall size of the Company&#8217;s balance sheet, earnings, and capital issuance and deployment. We continue to manage our capital position in accordance with our policy and strategy described above and in further detail in the 2019 Form 10-K. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

CSC and CSB are subject to various capital requirements set by regulatory agencies as discussed in further detail in the 2019 Form 10-K and in Item 1 &#8211; Note 15. As of June 30, 2020 , CSC and CSB are considered well capitalized.

(1) In the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules adopted in October 2019, Category III banking organizations such as CSC were given the ability to opt-out of the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital, and CSC made this opt-out election as of January 1, 2020. Therefore, AOCI is excluded from the amounts and ratios presented as of June 30, 2020 . In 2019, CSC and CSB were required to include all components of AOCI in regulatory capital; the amounts and ratios for December 31, 2019 are presented on this basis. 

CSB is also subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions. In addition, CSB is required to provide notice to, and may be required to obtain approval from, the Federal Reserve to declare dividends to CSC. 

As a broker-dealer, CS&#38;Co is subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule. At June 30, 2020 , CS&#38;Co was in compliance with its net capital requirements. 

In addition to the capital requirements above, Schwab&#8217;s subsidiaries are subject to other regulatory requirements intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity. See Item 1 &#8211; Note 15 for additional information on the components of stockholders&#8217; equity and information on the capital requirements of significant subsidiaries.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP), Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain references to the non-GAAP financial measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the Company, and facilitate meaningful comparison of Schwab&#8217;s results in the current period to both historic and future results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. 

Schwab&#8217;s use of non-GAAP measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to GAAP financial measures as described below. 

Non-GAAP Adjustment or Measure 

Definition 

Usefulness to Management and Investors 

Acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets 

Schwab adjusts certain GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of acquisition and integration-related costs incurred as a result of the Company&#8217;s completed and pending acquisitions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and, where applicable, the income tax effect of these expenses. 

Adjustments made to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets are reflective of all acquired intangible assets, which were recorded as part of purchase accounting. These acquired intangible assets contribute to the Company&#8217;s revenue generation. Amortization of acquired intangible assets will continue in future periods over their remaining useful lives. 

We exclude acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets for the purpose of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe doing so provides additional transparency of Schwab&#8217;s ongoing operations, and may be useful in both evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating comparison of results with prior and future periods. 

Acquisition and integration-related costs fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and integration activities, thereby limiting comparability of results among periods, and are not representative of the costs of running the Company&#8217;s ongoing business. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of the Company&#8217;s underlying operating performance. 

Return on tangible common equity 

Return on tangible common equity represents annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill, acquired intangible assets &#8211; net, and related deferred tax liabilities. 

Acquisitions typically result in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible assets. We believe return on tangible common equity may be useful to investors as a supplemental measure to facilitate assessing capital efficiency and returns relative to the composition of Schwab&#8217;s balance sheet. 

The following tables present reconciliations of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures:
