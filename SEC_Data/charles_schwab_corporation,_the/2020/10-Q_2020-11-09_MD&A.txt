 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

INTRODUCTION 

The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC) is a savings and loan holding company and engages, through its subsidiaries, in wealth management, securities brokerage, banking, asset management, custody, and financial advisory services. 

Unless otherwise indicated, the terms &#8220;Schwab,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; mean CSC together with its consolidated subsidiaries as of September 30, 2020. 

Principal business subsidiaries of CSC include the following: 

&#8226; Charles Schwab &#38; Co., Inc. (CS&#38;Co), a securities broker-dealer; 

&#8226; Charles Schwab Bank, SSB (CSB), our principal banking entity; and 

&#8226; Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (CSIM), the investment advisor for Schwab&#8217;s proprietary mutual funds (Schwab Funds &#174; ) and for Schwab&#8217;s exchange-traded funds (Schwab ETFs&#8482;). 

Subsequent to September 30, 2020, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively referred to as &#8220;TD Ameritrade&#8221; or &#8220;TDA&#8221;), effective October 6, 2020. Upon completion of the acquisition, TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (TDA Holding) became a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSC and the below became principal business subsidiaries of CSC: 

&#8226; TD Ameritrade, Inc., an introducing securities broker-dealer; and 

&#8226; TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc. (TDAC), a securities broker-dealer that provides trade execution and clearing services on a fully-disclosed basis to TD Ameritrade, Inc. 

Unless otherwise noted, this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis excludes the results of operations and financial condition of TD Ameritrade. See Overview and Item 1 &#8211; Notes 3 and 17 for additional information on our acquisition of TD Ameritrade. 

Schwab provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments &#8211; Investor Services and Advisor Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors, and retirement plan services, as well as other corporate brokerage services, to businesses and their employees. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking, and support services, as well as retirement business services, to independent registered investment advisors (RIAs), independent retirement advisors, and recordkeepers. 

Schwab was founded on the belief that all Americans deserve access to a better investing experience. Although much has changed in the intervening years, our purpose remains clear &#8211; to champion every client&#8217;s goals with passion and integrity. Guided by this purpose and our vision of creating the most trusted leader in investment services, management has adopted a strategy described as &#8220;Through Clients&#8217; Eyes.&#8221; 

This strategy emphasizes placing clients&#8217; perspectives, needs, and desires at the forefront. Because investing plays a fundamental role in building financial security, we strive to deliver a better investing experience for our clients &#8211; individual investors and the people and institutions who serve them &#8211; by disrupting longstanding industry practices on their behalf and providing superior service. We also aim to offer a broad range of products and solutions to meet client needs with a focus on transparency, value, and trust. In addition, management works to couple Schwab&#8217;s scale and resources with ongoing expense discipline to keep costs low and ensure that products and solutions are affordable as well as responsive to client needs. In combination, these are the key elements of our &#8220;no trade-offs&#8221; approach to serving investors. We believe that following this strategy is the best way to maximize our market valuation and stockholder returns over time. 

Management estimates that investable wealth in the United States (U.S.) (consisting of assets in defined contribution, retail wealth management and brokerage, and registered investment advisor channels, along with bank deposits) currently exceeds $45 trillion, which means Schwab&#8217;s and TD Ameritrade&#8217;s combined total client assets of approximately $6 trillion leaves substantial opportunity for growth. Our strategy is based on the principle that developing trusted relationships will translate into

more assets from both new and existing clients, ultimately driving more revenue, and along with expense discipline and thoughtful capital management, will generate earnings growth and build long-term stockholder value.

The first nine months of 2020 also includes $79.9 billion related to the acquisition of the assets of USAA&#8217;s Investment Management Company (USAA-IMCO) and an inflow of $10.9 billion from a mutual fund clearing services client. 

(2) The first nine months of 2020 include 1.1 million new brokerage accounts related to the acquisition of assets from USAA-IMCO.

(4) Adjusted total expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure adjusting total expenses excluding interest. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 

While the COVID-19 pandemic and challenging macroeconomic conditions persisted throughout the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, the Company&#8217;s business model and our continued focus on clients&#8217; needs helped drive sustained business momentum. Schwab continued to operate without significant client disruption, advancing the Company&#8217;s strategic goals to drive scale, monetization, and segmentation in ways that benefit our clients. Most notably, subsequent to September 30, 2020, Schwab completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade, which closed on October 6, 2020, as discussed further below. 

Throughout the third quarter of 2020, the equity markets generally increased while both short- and long-term interest rates remained under pressure. Net new assets totaled $51.2 billion in the third quarter, despite seasonal tax outflows in July from a delayed tax filing deadline. In addition to an $8.5 billion inflow to our Advisor Services business related to closing our acquisition of Wasmer, Schroeder &#38; Company, LLC, core net new assets totaled $42.7 billion in the third quarter of 2020, bringing year-to-date core net new assets to $162.5 billion, which represents a 5% annualized growth rate. New brokerage accounts totaled 592 thousand in the third quarter of 2020, and we ended the period at 14.4 million accounts, up 19% from September 30, 2019. Our clients continued to be highly engaged with their investments, as daily average trades were 1.5 million

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, up 103% and 109%, respectively, from the same periods in 2019. Against this backdrop, total client assets ended the third quarter at $4.40 trillion, up 17% from September 30, 2019. 

Our results of operations for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 reflect the strength of our business model as well as our financial management, even as the current macroeconomic environment remained challenging. Schwab&#8217;s net income was $698 million and $2.2 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, decreasing 27% and 24%, respectively, from the same periods in 2019. Diluted earnings per common share (EPS) amounted to $.48 and $1.54 during the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, down 31% and 25% from the same periods in the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS (1) , which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and related income tax effects, were $.51 and $1.66 during the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, down 27% and 20% from the same periods in the prior year. 

Total net revenues were $2.4 billion and $7.5 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, declining 10% and 7%, respectively, from the same periods in the prior year, primarily as a result of lower net interest revenue. Net interest revenue was helped by rising interest-earning asset levels throughout the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, though still decreased $288 million and $617 million, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2019. These declines in net interest revenue primarily resulted from the overall decline in both short- and long-term interest rates driven by the Federal Reserve&#8217;s monetary easing, as well as the related acceleration of mortgage-backed security prepayment speeds within our investment securities portfolio. Asset management and administration fees totaled $860 million and $2.5 billion during the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, increasing 4% and 5%, respectively, from the comparable periods in the prior year. The growth in asset management and administration fees was due primarily to rising balances in advisory solutions, which more than offset higher money market fund fee waivers. Trading revenue declined 12% and 11% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, compared with the same periods in the prior year, as our October 2019 pricing actions more than offset increased trading volumes throughout the first nine months of 2020. 

Total expenses excluding interest were $1.6 billion and $4.7 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, representing increases of 6% and 7%, respectively, relative to the comparable periods in 2019. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, total expenses excluding interest reflected acquisition and integration-related expenses of $42 million and $160 million, respectively, as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets of $25 million and $43 million, respectively. Exclusive of these items (1) , adjusted total expenses were up 2% and 3% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2019. 

Throughout the first nine months of 2020, the Company maintained its disciplined approach to capital management, helping sustain ongoing balance sheet growth. Total balance sheet assets increased to $419.4 billion at September 30, 2020, representing growth of 5% from the end of the second quarter and 43% from December 31, 2019. This growth in total balance sheet assets was driven by growth in our client base and continued higher client cash allocations due to the reduced attractiveness of fixed income and other cash alternatives in the low rate environment. During the second quarter, we issued $2.5 billion of preferred stock, Series G, at an initial fixed rate of 5.375%, bringing total preferred stock to $5.3 billion, which represented approximately 23% of Tier 1 Capital at September 30, 2020. The Company&#8217;s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.7% at September 30, 2020. 

Return on average common stockholders&#8217; equity was 10% and 12% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, down from 20% in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2019. Return on tangible common equity (1) (ROTCE) was 12% and 14% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, down from 21% and 22% in the comparable periods of 2019. The decreases in both return on average common stockholders&#8217; equity and ROTCE reflect lower net income as well as significantly higher balances of average accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) due to unrealized gains in our available for sale (AFS) investment securities portfolio. 

(1) Adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted total expenses, and return on tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results.

Business and Asset Acquisitions 

In addition to the October 6, 2020 acquisition of TD Ameritrade described below, the Company completed several acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. On May 26, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of the assets of USAA-IMCO for $1.6 billion in cash. Along with the asset purchase agreement, the companies entered into a long-term referral agreement that makes Schwab the exclusive provider of wealth management and investment brokerage services for USAA members. The USAA-IMCO acquisition adds scale to the Company&#8217;s operations through the addition of 1.1 million brokerage and managed portfolio accounts with approximately $80 billion in client assets at the acquisition date. The transaction also provides Schwab the opportunity to further expand our client base by serving USAA&#8217;s members through the long-term referral agreement. See Item 1 &#8211; Note 3 for more information on the USAA-IMCO acquisition. 

Additionally, during the second quarter of 2020 the Company completed its acquisition of technology and intellectual property of Motif, a financial technology company. The Motif assets help us build on our existing capabilities and help accelerate our development of thematic and direct index investing for Schwab&#8217;s retail investors and RIA clients. On July 1, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of Wasmer, Schroeder &#38; Company, LLC, which adds established strategies and new separately managed account offerings to our existing fixed income lineup. 

Subsequent Events 

Acquisition of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation 

Effective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of TD Ameritrade. TD Ameritrade provides securities brokerage services, including trade execution, clearing services, and margin lending, through its broker-dealer subsidiaries; and futures and foreign exchange trade execution services through its futures commission merchant (FCM) and forex dealer member (FDM) subsidiary. TDA also provides cash sweep and deposit account products through third-party relationships. 

TDA&#8217;s principal securities broker-dealers, TD Ameritrade, Inc. and TDAC, are registered broker-dealers with the SEC and members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). TD Ameritrade, Inc. is also a registered investment advisor with the SEC. TD Ameritrade Futures &#38; Forex LLC (TDAFF) is registered as an FCM and FDM with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and is a member of the National Futures Association (NFA). 

TDA provides services to individual retail investors and traders and to RIAs predominantly through the Internet, a national branch network, and relationships with RIAs. At the time of acquisition, TD Ameritrade had approximately 10,000 employees. TD Ameritrade&#8217;s sources of net revenues consist primarily of commissions and transaction fees, bank deposit account fees, net interest revenue, and investment product fees. 

&#8226; TDA&#8217;s commissions and transaction fees have included commissions earned on trades of certain securities and derivatives, as well as order flow revenue. 

&#8226; TDA&#8217;s bank deposit account fees have been generated through TD Ameritrade&#8217;s insured deposit account agreement with TD Bank USA, National Association and TD Bank, National Association (together, the TD Depository Institutions), as well as bank deposit account agreements with other third-party depository institutions, whereby uninvested cash held by certain of TDA&#8217;s brokerage clients is swept into Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured (up to specified limits) money market deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions and other third-party depository institutions. TDA has earned revenue on client cash at these depository institutions based on the return of floating-rate and fixed-rate notional investments, less the interest paid to clients and certain other fees. 

&#8226; TDA&#8217;s net interest revenue has been generated primarily through margin lending, securities lending activity, as well as segregated and operating cash and investments. Interest-bearing liabilities have primarily consisted of interest-bearing payables to brokerage clients. 

&#8226; TDA&#8217;s investment product fee revenue has consisted of revenues earned on client assets invested in money market funds, other mutual funds, and certain investment programs. Investment product fees also includes referral and asset-based program fees on its client assets managed by independent RIAs utilizing TDA&#8217;s trading and investing platforms.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

Concurrently with the execution of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 24, 2019, as amended (the merger agreement), CSC entered into a stockholder agreement with The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank), a registration rights agreement with TD Bank and Charles R. Schwab, and an amended and restated insured deposit account agreement (IDA agreement) with the TD Depository Institutions. These agreements were effective upon the merger and are further detailed in Part I &#8211; Item 1 of our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Effective upon the merger, Todd M. Ricketts, Brian M. Levitt, and Bharat B. Masrani were elected to CSC&#8217;s Board of Directors. Mr. Ricketts was designated by TD Ameritrade pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement and Messrs. Levitt and Masrani were designated by TD Bank pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement and the stockholder agreement between Schwab and TD Bank. 

Integration Overview 

We anticipate the acquisition of TD Ameritrade will significantly increase our scale to help support the Company&#8217;s ongoing efforts to enhance the client experience, provide deeper resources for individual investors as well as RIAs, and continue to improve our operating efficiency. With a combined total for Schwab and TD Ameritrade of approximately $6 trillion in client assets and 29 million brokerage accounts at the time of closing, we expect our enhanced scale will lower total expenses as a percentage of client assets. Combining the respective strengths of Schwab and TD Ameritrade will enable the Company to invest in enhanced client experience capabilities and further our financial success to the benefit of clients, employees, and stockholders. 

The integration of Schwab&#8217;s and TD Ameritrade&#8217;s operations is expected to occur over 18 to 36 months from the date of acquisition, though planning for integration has been underway since the acquisition was announced on November 25, 2019. In October, the Company began efforts to reduce overlapping or redundant roles across the two firms and to rationalize branch locations of Schwab and TDA. These and other integration activities are expected to continue throughout the integration process. Until the integration is complete, Schwab and TD Ameritrade will continue to operate separate broker-dealers to serve their respective clients. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2020, TD Ameritrade will be incorporated into our two existing reportable segments. 

Amended IDA Agreement and Bank Deposit Account Fee Revenue 

In accordance with the amended IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions, cash held in TD Ameritrade&#8217;s eligible customer accounts will continue to be swept to money market deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab will provide marketing, recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the money market deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee, determined by reference to certain yields, less a service fee on client cash deposits held at the TD Depository Institutions, FDIC deposit assessments, and interest on deposits paid to customers. Under the amended IDA, the service fee on client cash deposits held at the TD Depository Institutions was reduced by 40%, from 25 basis points to 15 basis points for the life of the agreement. Under TDA&#8217;s prior IDA agreement, TDA had floors in place which enabled them to carve-out up to $20 billion of floating-rate investments from the applicable service fee during specified low-rate environments. Pursuant to the amended IDA agreement, the 15 basis point service fee will be applied across all designated fixed and floating IDA balances. 

Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect to begin recognizing significant bank deposit account fee revenue pursuant to the amended IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions and TDA&#8217;s existing agreements with other third-party depository institutions. The net fees earned by Schwab under these arrangements will be included in a new revenue line item in our consolidated statement of income titled bank deposit account fees. In addition, as part of our management of interest rate risk, Schwab will begin performing interest rate sensitivity analysis on our bank deposit account fee revenue. 

Beginning July 1, 2021, Schwab will have the option to begin reducing deposit balances swept to the TD Depository Institutions by up to $10 billion over each 12-month period, subject to certain limitations and adjustments, migrating them instead to Schwab&#8217;s balance sheet. Our ability to migrate these balances to our balance sheet is dependent on certain binding limitations, including Schwab&#8217;s obligation to move all of the uninsured IDA sweep balances on that date, and the requirement that Schwab can only move floating IDA balances. Schwab&#8217;s initial reduction will also be affected by the net change in IDA sweep balances between the effective date of the IDA agreement and June 30, 2021. In addition, Schwab also must maintain a minimum $50 billion IDA sweep balance through June 2031, and at least 80% of the IDA sweep balances must be designated as fixed-rate obligations through June 2026.

Planned Change of CSC Headquarters 

Subsequent to September 30, 2020 and in conjunction with the close of the acquisition of TD Ameritrade, CSC&#8217;s Board of Directors approved an amendment to Section 1.02 of the Company&#8217;s Fourth Restated Bylaws to change our corporate headquarters from San Francisco to Westlake, Texas, effective January 1, 2021. Opened in late 2019, the Westlake location provides a more centrally located hub for the Company given our nationwide presence across our network of branches and operations centers. 

Current Regulatory Environment and Other Developments 

Effective March 20, 2020, CSB and Charles Schwab Premier Bank, SSB (CSPB) converted to Texas-chartered state savings banks. CSB and CSPB became members of the Federal Reserve and are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve and the Texas Department of Savings and Mortgage Lending. 

In September 2020, the Federal Reserve issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that, among other things, would amend the stress testing rules for covered savings and loan holding companies to provide that their capital distribution assumptions would match those of comparable bank holding companies. The rule proposal also solicits feedback on whether large savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs) should be subject to the capital planning and stress capital buffer requirements that apply to large bank holding companies. The comment period for the proposed rule and SLHC questions ends on November 20, 2020. 

In October 2020, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC issued a final net stable funding ratio (NSFR) rule that will require certain banking organizations with $100 billion or more in consolidated assets to maintain a minimum level of stable funding based on the liquidity characteristics of the banking organization&#8217;s assets, commitments, and derivative exposures over a one-year time horizon. The NSFR will be expressed as a ratio of a banking organization&#8217;s available stable funding to its required stable funding. Banking organizations subject to the full requirement must maintain an NSFR equal to at least 1.0 on an ongoing basis. As a banking organization subject to Category III standards with less than $75 billion in average weighted short-term wholesale funding, CSC will be subject to a reduced NSFR requirement equal to 85% of the full requirement. The rule will take effect on July 1, 2021 and beginning in 2023, holding companies regulated by the Federal Reserve will be required to publicly disclose their NSFR levels semiannually. The Company does not expect the NSFR rule to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, or results of operations.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

Net Interest Revenue 

Revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and loans, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and loans. 

Late in the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds target overnight rate twice, for a total of 150 basis points to near zero; on the longer-end of the curve, the 10-year Treasury rate declined by over 120 basis points. Lower interest rates across maturities persisted from the end of the first quarter through the third quarter of 2020, while credit spreads also compressed. Moreover, changes in the economic environment throughout the first nine months of 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic drove significantly higher levels of client cash sweep balances. As these balances rapidly accumulated in the first quarter of 2020, the Company initially placed a substantial amount in excess reserves held at the Federal Reserve, and subsequently deployed a significant amount of this cash build-up in the second and third quarters, as part of AFS securities purchases totaling $73.9 billion and $45.2 billion, respectively. These purchases were made at rates below the average yield on the existing AFS portfolio due to the current low interest rate environment. As of September 30, 2020, the Company held $21.9 billion, or 6.8% of total deposits, in excess reserves, ending the quarter within our longer-term objective of approximately 5-7%.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

Net interest revenue decreased $288 million, or 18%, and $617 million, or 13% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019, due primarily to lower average investment yields partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets. Accelerated premium amortization on debt securities in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 also contributed to the reduction in net interest revenue, as the decline in long-term interest rates in the first nine months of 2020 resulted in higher prepayments of mortgage-related debt securities. 

Average interest-earning assets for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 were higher by 45% and 29%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. These increases in average interest-earning assets were primarily driven by higher client cash balances in bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients. 

Our net interest margin was 1.38% and 1.64% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, down from 2.43% during both the third quarter and first nine months of 2019. These decreases were driven primarily by lower yields received on interest-earning assets due largely to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s 2019 and 2020 interest rate reductions and higher premium amortization on mortgage-related debt securities. The amount of any further net interest margin compression and resulting net interest revenue is dependent on a number of factors, including changes to LIBOR, premium amortization, and growth in client cash balances.

(3) Includes various asset-related fees, such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, and mutual fund clearing fees and other service fees. 

(4) Includes miscellaneous service and transaction fees relating to mutual funds and ETFs that are not balance-based. 

Asset management and administration fees increased by $35 million, or 4%, and $122 million, or 5% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. These increases were primarily driven by higher balances in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA, as well as purchased money market funds, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 relative to the same periods in 2019. These increases were partially offset by the effect of money market fund fee waivers due to declining portfolio yields. The amount of fee waivers in coming quarters is dependent on a variety of factors, including the level of short-term interest rates and client preferences across our money market fund line-up. 

The following tables present a roll forward of client assets for the Schwab money market funds, Schwab equity and bond funds, ETFs, and CTFs, and Mutual Fund OneSource &#174; and other non-transaction fee (NTF) funds. These funds generated 39% and 43% of the asset management and administration fees earned during the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, compared to 44% of asset management and administration fees for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2019:

Revenue per trade (2) 

$ 1.94 $ 4.52 (57) % $ 1.93 $ 4.56 (58) % 

Note: Effective October 7, 2019, CS&#38;Co eliminated online trade commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options. 

(1) Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, order flow revenue was reclassified from other revenue to trading revenue. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change. 

(2) Revenue per trade is calculated as trading revenue divided by DATs multiplied by the number of trading days. 

Trading revenue decreased $25 million, or 12%, and $68 million, or 11%, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019, due primarily to our October 2019 pricing actions, which more than offset a significant increase in clients&#8217; daily average trades and higher order flow revenue. Order flow revenue was $67 million and $34 million during the third quarters of 2020 and 2019, and $194 million and $99 million during the first nine months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increases in order flow revenue were due to a higher volume of trades throughout the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 relative to the same periods in 2019. 

Other Revenue 

Other revenue includes exchange processing fees, certain service fees, software fees, and non-recurring gains. Other revenue increased $15 million, or 31%, in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2019 primarily due to increases in exchange processing fees and other service fees. 

Other revenue decreased $37 million, or 19% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily driven by a gain from the sale of a portfolio management and reporting software solution for advisors to Tamarac Inc. recognized in the second quarter of 2019, a gain from the assignment of leased office space recognized in the first quarter of 2019, and an increase in the allowance for credit losses on bank loans in the first quarter of 2020. These decreases in the first nine months of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019 were partially offset by higher exchange processing fees due to higher trade volume.

Expenses excluding interest increased by 6% and 7% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. Adjusted total expenses, which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets, increased 2% and 3% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results. 

Total compensation and benefits remained relatively flat in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, compared to the same periods in 2019. Increases in employee headcount in 2020 to support our expanding client base as well as acquisition and integration-related activity, including the hiring of approximately 400 former USAA employees in connection with the USAA-IMCO acquisition, were partially offset by severance charges incurred in the third quarter of 2019 and a lower corporate bonus accrual in 2020. The increase in the year-to-date amounts also reflected the Company&#8217;s payment of $1,000 to all non-officer employees in March 2020 to help them cover costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Professional services expense increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily due to expenses relating to acquisition and integration-related activity. 

Occupancy and equipment expense increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily due to an increase in technology equipment costs associated with higher customer trade volumes and overall growth in the business. 

Communications expense increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily due to higher customer trade volumes as well as overall growth in our business and client base. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses grew in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily due to higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software, as well as higher depreciation of buildings and equipment related to expansion of our campuses in the U.S. in 2019 and 2020. Amortization of acquired intangible assets grew due to acquisitions completed in the second and third quarters of 2020.

Other expenses increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily resulting from acquisition and integration-related costs and increases in processing fees and related expenses due to higher customer trade volumes and market volatility. These increases were partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expense. 

Capital expenditures were $122 million and $541 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, compared with $190 million and $544 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively. Capital expenditures decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily due to lower building expansion in 2020 relative to the first nine months of 2019, largely offset by higher capitalized software costs. We anticipate capital expenditures for full-year 2020 to be approximately 5-6% of total net revenues. 

Taxes on Income 

Taxes on income were $191 million and $285 million for the third quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively, resulting in effective income tax rates on income before taxes of 21.5% and 23.1%, respectively. Taxes on income were $660 million and $884 million for the first nine months of 2020 and 2019, respectively, resulting in effective income tax rates on income before taxes of 23.4% and 23.7%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 was primarily due to federal tax benefits recognized during the current period including settlement of the IRS examination of tax years 2011-2014 and an increase in Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) benefits. Partially offsetting the decrease in the effective tax rate from these items was an increase in nondeductible acquisition costs and FDIC insurance premium disallowance, as well as a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits during the nine-month period.

Also in the first nine months of 2020, Investor Services includes inflows of $79.9 billion related to the acquisition of the assets of USAA-IMCO and $10.9 billion from a mutual fund clearing services client. 

Investor Services 

Total net revenues decreased by 8% and 7% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily due to decreases in net interest revenue and trading revenue, partially offset by an increase in asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue decreased primarily due to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets. Trading revenue decreased primarily as a result of our 2019 pricing actions, more than offsetting higher trading volume in 2020. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to higher balances in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA, as well as increased balances in purchased money market funds, partially offset by money market fund fee waivers. 

Expenses excluding interest increased by 9% both in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other expenses. Compensation and benefits increased primarily as a result of increased headcount to support our expanding client base and acquisition and integration-related activities, as well as the Company&#8217;s March 2020 payment of $1,000 to all non-officer employees to help them cover costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by severance charges incurred in the third quarter of 2019 and a lower corporate bonus accrual in 2020. Professional services increased primarily due to acquisition and integration-related activity. Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software and higher depreciation of buildings and equipment related to expansion of our campuses in 2019 and 2020. Amortization of acquired intangible assets increased due to our 2020 acquisitions. Other expenses increased primarily due to acquisition and integration-

related costs, as well as exchange processing fees and related expenses resulting from higher customer trade volumes and market volatility, partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expenses. 

Advisor Services 

Total net revenues decreased by 13% and 10% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily due to decreases in net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, trading revenue, and other revenue. Net interest revenue decreased primarily due to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets. Asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to lower Mutual Fund OneSource &#174; balances. Trading revenue decreased primarily as a result of the Company&#8217;s 2019 pricing actions, partially offset by higher trading volume. The year to date decrease in other revenue was primarily driven by a gain from the sale of a portfolio management and reporting software solution for advisors to Tamarac Inc. recognized in the second quarter of 2019, and a gain from the assignment of leased office space recognized in the first quarter of 2019. 

Expenses excluding interest remained relatively flat, decreasing 3% and increasing 1% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. Compensation and benefits decreased primarily due to third quarter of 2019 severance charges and a lower corporate bonus accrual in 2020, partially offset by increased headcount and the Company&#8217;s March 2020 payment of $1,000 to all non-officer employees to help them cover costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Largely offsetting this decrease were increases in professional services, depreciation and amortization, and communications. The increase in professional services was driven by expenses related to our acquisitions and overall growth in the business. Depreciation and amortization increased due to higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software, and higher depreciation of buildings and equipment related to expansion of our campuses. Communications expense increased due to higher customer trade volumes and overall growth in our business and client base. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Schwab&#8217;s business activities expose us to a variety of risks, including operational, credit, market, liquidity, and compliance risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. For a discussion of our risk management programs, see Item 7 &#8211; Risk Management in the 2019 Form 10-K. 

Net Interest Revenue Simulation 

For our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulations include all interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, repricing of financial instruments, and reinvestment of matured or paid-down securities and loans. 

Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets primarily include investment securities, margin loans and bank loans. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. Because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans, and control the composition of our investment securities, we have some ability to manage our net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

Net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next 12 months beginning September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period: 

September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Increase of 100 basis points 13.9 % 4.8 % Decrease of 100 basis points (4.8) % (7.4) % 

The change in net interest revenue sensitivities as of September 30, 2020 reflects a significantly lower interest rate curve from the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the global economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher short-term interest rates would positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interest-earning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources. A decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the Company&#8217;s investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources, compressing net interest margin. 

In addition to measuring the effect of a gradual 100 basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates, we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel- and non-parallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue. 

Economic Value of Equity Simulation 

Management also uses economic value of equity (EVE) simulations to measure interest rate risk. EVE sensitivity measures the long-term impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment. Key assumptions in our EVE calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, term structure models of interest rates, non-maturity deposit behavior, and pricing assumptions. 

As a result of the low interest rate environment in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, the downward assessments of our net interest revenue and EVE simulations as of September 30, 2020 reflected the assumption of non-negative investment yields. 

Through our IDA agreement and bank deposit account agreements with other third-party depository institutions resulting from our acquisition of TD Ameritrade, we expect to start earning significant bank deposit account fee revenue beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020. Though accounted for and presented separately from net interest revenue, bank deposit account fee revenue will be sensitive to interest rates. Therefore, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, management will evaluate bank deposit account fee revenue as part of Schwab&#8217;s comprehensive management of our exposure to interest rate risk, through modeling and simulation analysis. 

See Overview and Item 1 &#8211; Notes 3 and 17 for additional information on the Company&#8217;s acquisition of TD Ameritrade and the amended IDA agreement. 

Expected Phase-out of LIBOR 

The Company has established a firm-wide team to address the likely discontinuation of LIBOR. As part of our efforts, we have assessed our LIBOR exposures, the largest of which are certain investment securities and loans. In purchasing new investment securities, we ensure that appropriate fall-back language is in the security&#8217;s prospectus in the event that LIBOR is unavailable or deemed unreliable, and we have sold certain securities lacking appropriate fall-back language. We are updating loan agreements to ensure new LIBOR-based loans adequately provide for an alternative to LIBOR. Furthermore, we plan to phase-out the use of LIBOR as a reference rate in our new lending products before December 2021. Consistent with our &#8220;Through Clients&#8217; Eyes&#8221; strategy, our focus throughout the LIBOR transition process is to ensure clients are treated fairly and consistently as this major change is occurring in the financial markets. The market transition process has not yet progressed to a point at which the impact to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements of LIBOR&#8217;s discontinuation can be estimated.

Liquidity Risk 

Funding Sources 

Schwab&#8217;s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients. 

Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, repurchase agreements, and cash provided by external financing. 

To meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments, including U.S. Treasury securities. 

In addition to internal sources of liquidity, Schwab has access to external funding. The following table describes external debt facilities available at September 30, 2020:

CSC&#8217;s ratings for Commercial Paper Notes are P1 by Moody&#8217;s Investor Service (Moody&#8217;s), A1 by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Rating Group (Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s), and F1 by Fitch Ratings, Ltd (Fitch) at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

CSC also has a universal automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, which enables it to issue debt, equity, and other securities. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

Pursuant to the 2019 interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, Schwab became subject to a reduced LCR rule requiring the Company to hold high quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to at least 85% of the Company&#8217;s projected net cash outflows over a prospective 30-calendar-day period of acute liquidity stress, calculated on each business day. See Part I &#8211; Item 1 &#8211; Regulation in the 2019 Form 10-K for additional information. The Company was in compliance with the reduced LCR rule at September 30, 2020. The table below presents information about our average daily LCR:

TD Ameritrade Acquisition 

Subsequent to September 30, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade, effective October 6, 2020. TDA Holding has $3.6 billion of par value unsecured Senior Notes (TDA Senior Notes) outstanding, which were recognized at the date of acquisition at provisional fair value with no change in existing terms. For additional information on our acquisition of TD Ameritrade and the terms of the TDA Senior Notes, see Item 1 &#8211; Notes 3 and 9. 

TD Ameritrade Lines of Credit and Revolving Credit Facilities 

TDAC utilizes secured uncommitted lines of credit for short-term liquidity, under which TDAC borrows on either a demand or short-term basis and pledges client margin securities as collateral. There were no borrowings outstanding under the secured uncommitted lines of credit as of the effective time of the acquisition on October 6, 2020. 

TDAC has access to two senior unsecured committed revolving credit facilities with an aggregate principal amount of $1.45 billion, consisting of an $850 million senior revolving credit facility and a $600 million senior revolving credit facility, maturing on April 20, 2021 and April 21, 2022, respectively. There were no borrowings outstanding under the TDAC senior revolving facilities as of the effective time of the acquisition on October 6, 2020. 

TDA Holding has access to a senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $300 million. The maturity date of the TDA Holding revolving credit facility is April 21, 2022. As of October 6, 2020, Schwab entered into a guaranty supplement to guarantee the obligations of TD Ameritrade under this credit agreement. The provision of the guaranty supplement by Schwab was a condition for certain financial covenant and reporting obligations being modified in the credit agreement. There were no borrowings outstanding under the TDA Holding revolving credit facility as of the effective time of the acquisition on October 6, 2020.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

Schwab seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of our business strategy, including anticipated balance sheet growth, providing financial support to our subsidiaries, and sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to our banking subsidiaries. Schwab&#8217;s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets. To ensure that Schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios. 

As a result of the significant inflow of client cash in the first nine months of 2020, our consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio declined from 7.3% at year-end 2019 to 5.7% at September 30, 2020, below our long-term operating objective of 6.75%-7.00% but well above the regulatory minimum of 4.00%. The pace of our return to the long-term operating objective over time depends on a number of factors including the overall size of the Company&#8217;s balance sheet, earnings, and capital issuance and deployment. We continue to manage our capital position in accordance with our policy and strategy described above and in further detail in the 2019 Form 10-K. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

CSC and CSB are subject to various capital requirements set by regulatory agencies as discussed in further detail in the 2019 Form 10-K and in Item 1 &#8211; Note 15. As of September 30, 2020, CSC and CSB are considered well capitalized. 

The following table details CSC&#8217;s consolidated and CSB&#8217;s capital ratios as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019:

(1) In the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules adopted in October 2019, Category III banking organizations such as CSC were given the ability to opt-out of the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital, and CSC made this opt-out election as of January 1, 2020. Therefore, AOCI is excluded from the amounts and ratios presented as of September 30, 2020. In 2019, CSC and CSB were required to include all components of AOCI in regulatory capital; the amounts and ratios for December 31, 2019 are presented on this basis. 

CSB is also subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions. In addition, CSB is required to provide notice to, and may be required to obtain approval from, the Federal Reserve to declare dividends to CSC. 

As a broker-dealer, CS&#38;Co is subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule. At September 30, 2020, CS&#38;Co was in compliance with its net capital requirements.

In addition, Schwab had outstanding margin loans to foreign residents of $1.1 billion at September 30, 2020. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Schwab enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, Schwab enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see Item 1 &#8211; Notes 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11, and Item 8 &#8211; Note 14 in the 2019 Form 10-K. 

Subsequent to September 30, 2020, and concurrent with the closing of the acquisition of TD Ameritrade effective October 6, 2020, the Company entered into an IDA agreement with the TD Bank Depository Institutions. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, certain TD Ameritrade, Inc. and TDAC brokerage customer deposits are required to be swept to the TD Bank Depository

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with GAAP, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain references to the non-GAAP financial measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the Company, and facilitate meaningful comparison of Schwab&#8217;s results in the current period to both historic and future results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. 

Schwab&#8217;s use of non-GAAP measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to GAAP financial measures as described below. 

Non-GAAP Adjustment or Measure Definition Usefulness to Management and Investors Acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets Schwab adjusts certain GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of acquisition and integration-related costs incurred as a result of the Company&#8217;s acquisitions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and, where applicable, the income tax effect of these expenses. Adjustments made to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets are reflective of all acquired intangible assets, which were recorded as part of purchase accounting. These acquired intangible assets contribute to the Company&#8217;s revenue generation. Amortization of acquired intangible assets will continue in future periods over their remaining useful lives. We exclude acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets for the purpose of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe doing so provides additional transparency of Schwab&#8217;s ongoing operations, and may be useful in both evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating comparison of results with prior and future periods. Acquisition and integration-related costs fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and integration activities, thereby limiting comparability of results among periods, and are not representative of the costs of running the Company&#8217;s ongoing business. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of the Company&#8217;s underlying operating performance. Return on tangible common equity Return on tangible common equity represents annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill, acquired intangible assets &#8211; net, and related deferred tax liabilities. Acquisitions typically result in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible assets. We believe return on tangible common equity may be useful to investors as a supplemental measure to facilitate assessing capital efficiency and returns relative to the composition of Schwab&#8217;s balance sheet. 

The following tables present reconciliations of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Total expenses excluding interest (GAAP) $ 1,559 $ 1,475 $ 4,691 $ 4,379 Acquisition and integration-related costs (1)

(1) Acquisition and integration-related costs are primarily included in professional services, compensation and benefits, and other expense.
