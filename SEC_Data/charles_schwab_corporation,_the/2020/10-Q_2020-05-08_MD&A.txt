 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

INTRODUCTION 

The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC) is a savings and loan holding company and engages, through its subsidiaries, in wealth management, securities brokerage, banking, asset management, custody, and financial advisory services. 

Principal business subsidiaries of CSC include the following: 

&#8226; 

Charles Schwab &#38; Co., Inc. (CS&#38;Co), a securities broker-dealer; 

&#8226; 

Charles Schwab Bank, SSB (CSB), our principal banking entity; and 

&#8226; 

Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (CSIM), the investment advisor for Schwab&#8217;s proprietary mutual funds (Schwab Funds &#174; ) and for Schwab&#8217;s exchange-traded funds (Schwab ETFs&#8482;). 

Unless otherwise indicated, the terms &#8220;Schwab,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; mean CSC together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 

Schwab provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments &#8211; Investor Services and Advisor Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors, and retirement plan services, as well as other corporate brokerage services, to businesses and their employees. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking, and support services, as well as retirement business services, to independent registered investment advisors (RIAs), independent retirement advisors, and recordkeepers. 

Schwab was founded on the belief that all Americans deserve access to a better investing experience. Although much has changed in the intervening years, our purpose remains clear &#8211; to champion every client&#8217;s goals with passion and integrity. Guided by this purpose and our vision of creating the most trusted leader in investment services, management has adopted a strategy described as &#8220;Through Clients&#8217; Eyes.&#8221; 

This strategy emphasizes placing clients&#8217; perspectives, needs, and desires at the forefront. Because investing plays a fundamental role in building financial security, we strive to deliver a better investing experience for our clients &#8211; individual investors and the people and institutions who serve them &#8211; by disrupting longstanding industry practices on their behalf and providing superior service. We also aim to offer a broad range of products and solutions to meet client needs with a focus on transparency, value, and trust. In addition, management works to couple Schwab&#8217;s scale and resources with ongoing expense discipline to keep costs low and ensure that products and solutions are affordable as well as responsive to client needs. In combination, these are the key elements of our &#8220;no trade-offs&#8221; approach to serving investors. We believe that following this strategy is the best way to maximize our market valuation and stockholder returns over time. 

Management estimates that investable wealth in the United States (U.S.) (consisting of assets in defined contribution, retail wealth management and brokerage, and registered investment advisor channels, along with bank deposits) currently exceeds $45 trillion, which means the Company&#8217;s $3.50 trillion in client assets leaves substantial opportunity for growth. Our strategy is based on the principle that developing trusted relationships will translate into more assets from both new and existing clients, ultimately driving more revenue, and along with expense discipline and thoughtful capital management, will generate earnings growth and build long-term stockholder value. 

This Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 ( 2019 Form 10-K). 

On our website, https://www.aboutschwab.com , we post the following filings after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The first quarter of 2020 saw an unprecedented environment as the COVID-19 pandemic upended daily life both world-wide and here in the U.S. Throughout this challenging time, the Company operated without significant client disruption. Schwab&#8217;s unwavering focus on continuing to earn our clients&#8217; trust is made possible by the significant contributions of our employees, and the Company remains committed to serving our clients while protecting our employees&#8217; wellbeing. In response to the pandemic, we have enabled approximately 95% of our employees to work remotely, and, in addition to other measures, we made a $1,000 payment to all non-officer employees to help them cover costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Core net new assets during the first quarter totaled $73.2 billion, up 42% from the first quarter of 2019. Clients opened 609,000 new brokerage accounts, bringing total active brokerage accounts to 12.7 million at quarter end, up 8% from March 2019. The first quarter saw record trading activity, as daily average trades for the period reached 1.5 million, a 98% increase from the first quarter of 2019. Our ongoing and multi-year investments in our technology systems helped ensure we efficiently processed the quarter&#8217;s record trading activity and client interactions across our various communication channels. 

Schwab&#8217;s first quarter financial results were shaped by this very challenging economic environment in which the decade-long bull market ended &#8211; with the S&#38;P falling 20% during the period and the Federal Reserve cutting the target overnight rate 150 basis points to near zero in an emergency effort to help shield the economy amid pandemic concerns. Schwab&#8217;s first quarter net income totaled $795 million, a decrease of $169 million, or 18%, from the first quarter of 2019. Diluted earnings per common share in the first quarter of $0.58 represented a decrease of 16% from the first quarter of 2019.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

Total net revenues in the quarter were $2.6 billion, a decrease of 4% from the first quarter of 2019. Net interest revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, due to declines in interest rates across maturities in the quarter, which offset the impact of significantly higher levels of client cash balances held at our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries. Asset management and administration fees of $827 million represented a 10% increase from the first quarter of 2019, largely due to our clients&#8217; sustained utilization of advice solutions along with increased balances in purchased money market funds, helping offset sharp declines in equity market valuations. Trading revenue declined 13% year-over-year to $188 million due to our October 2019 pricing actions, partially offset by the significant increase in trading volume. 

Total expenses excluding interest were $1.6 billion in the quarter, representing an increase of 8% from the first quarter of 2019. This total included approximately $27 million for the $1,000 payments to employees and other compensation and business continuity expenses relating to our pandemic response. Our first quarter expenses also included $37 million relating to our pending acquisitions described below. Our longstanding focus on scale and efficiency has helped us begin the year with a first quarter pre-tax profit margin of 40.0% and remains an important strength as we balance near-term profitability with continued reinvestment for long-term growth. 

Regardless of the environment, our priorities for balance sheet management remain intact, including supporting our ongoing growth while also maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity and capital. With first quarter market volatility and lower interest rates driving a significant influx of client cash, total balance sheet assets increased by $77 billion during the quarter to $371 billion at March 31 st . Consistent with optimizing liquidity management during heightened volatility, we issued 5- and 10-year senior notes totaling $1.1 billion in March. We finished the first quarter with a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 6.9%, consistent with our operating objective of 6.75%-7.00%. Return on average common stockholders&#8217; equity was 14% for the first quarter of 2020, down from 20% in the first quarter of 2019, due to lower net income as well as a $3.9 billion increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) due to unrealized gains in our available for sale (AFS) investment securities portfolio. 

Our pending acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and assets of USAA-IMCO remain on track, with anticipated closing of USAA-IMCO expected in mid-2020, and TD Ameritrade in the second half of 2020. In late February, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wasmer Schroeder, which will add established strategies and new separately managed account offerings to our existing fixed income lineup. Our purchase of Wasmer Schroeder is also expected to close mid-2020, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. 

Subsequent Event 

On April 30, 2020, the Company issued and sold 2,500,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th ownership interest in a share of 5.375% fixed-rate reset non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series G, $0.01 par value per share, with a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share (equivalent of $1,000 per depositary share). The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $2.47 billion, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses. 

Current Regulatory Environment and Other Developments 

Effective March 20, 2020, CSB and Charles Schwab Premier Bank (CSPB) converted to Texas-chartered state savings banks. CSB and CSPB became members of the Federal Reserve and are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve and the Texas Department of Savings and Mortgage Lending.

(1) In the first quarter of 2020, order flow revenue was reclassified from other revenue to trading revenue. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change. 

Net Interest Revenue 

Revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and loans, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and loans. 

Interest rates across maturities declined during the first three months of 2020 relative to the end of 2019 . During the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds target overnight rate twice, for a total of 150 basis points to near zero; on the longer-end of the curve, the 10-year Treasury rate declined by over 120 basis points. The changes in the economic environment in the first quarter of 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic drove significantly higher levels of client cash sweep balances. Given the rapid accumulation of these balances, the Company initially placed a substantial amount in excess reserves at the Federal Reserve, which totaled $58.7 billion at March 31, 2020, up from $18.8 billion at the end of 2019. Similarly, from December 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020, payables to brokerage clients increased $10.0 billion while margin loan balances decreased $2.3 billion, contributing to growth in cash and investments segregated. Consistent with our existing asset-liability-management approach, we expect to invest the majority of the amounts currently held in excess reserves into higher yielding investments over the next several quarters.

(1) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost. 

(2) On January 1, 2020, the Company transferred all of its investment securities designated as held to maturity (HTM) to the AFS category, as described in Note 4. 

(3) Interest revenue or expense was less than $500,000 in the period or periods presented. 

Net interest revenue decreased $109 million , or 6% , in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , due primarily to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets. 

Average interest-earning assets for the first quarter of 2020 were higher by 7% compared to the same period in 2019 . The increase in average interest-earning assets for the first quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by higher client cash balances in bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients. 

Our net interest margin was 2.14% during the first quarter of 2020 , down from 2.46% a year earlier. This decrease was driven primarily by lower yields received on interest-earning assets due largely to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s 2019 and 2020 interest rate decreases. We expect some net interest margin compression in coming quarters largely due to the impact of lower interest rates across maturities; at the same time, higher balances of cash and other interest-earning assets can be additive to net interest revenue. The amount of net interest margin compression and resulting net interest revenue is dependent on a number of factors, including the timing of investing cash into higher yielding assets, changes to LIBOR, and the level of client cash balances.

(1) Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, Schwab ETF OneSource&#8482; was discontinued as a result of the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed ETFs. 

(2) Average client assets for advice solutions may also include the asset balances contained in the mutual fund and/or ETF categories listed above. 

(3) Includes various asset-related fees, such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, and mutual fund clearing fees and other service fees. 

(4) Includes miscellaneous service and transaction fees relating to mutual funds and ETFs that are not balance-based. 

Asset management and administration fees increased by $72 million , or 10% , in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 . This increase was primarily driven by higher revenue from increased balances in purchased money market funds and advice solutions in the first quarter of 2020 relative to the first quarter of 2019, helping offset declines in equity market valuations in the first quarter of 2020. 

The following table presents a roll forward of client assets for the Schwab money market funds, Schwab equity and bond funds, ETFs, and CTFs, and Mutual Fund OneSource &#174; and other non-transaction fee (NTF) funds. These funds generated 45% of the asset management and administration fees earned during the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 :

(1) 

In the first quarter of 2020, order flow revenue was reclassified from other revenue to trading revenue. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change. 

(2) 

Revenue per trade is calculated as trading revenue divided by DATs multiplied by the number of trading days. 

Trading revenue decreased $29 million , or 13% , in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , due primarily to our 2019 pricing actions, which more than offset a significant increase in clients&#8217; daily average trades and higher order flow revenue amid heightened market volatility. Order flow revenue was $55 million and $32 million during the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The increase in order flow revenue during the first quarter of 2020 was due to a higher volume of trades. 

Other Revenue 

Other revenue includes certain service fees, software fees, exchange processing fees, and non-recurring gains. Other revenue decreased $40 million , or 57% , in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 . This decrease was primarily driven by a gain recognized in the first quarter of 2019 from the assignment of leased office space, as well as an increase in the allowance for credit losses on bank loans in the first quarter of 2020.

Total compensation and benefits increased in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , reflecting annual merit increases and an increase in employee headcount to support our expanding client base. The increase was also due to the Company&#8217;s payment of $1,000 to all non-officer employees in March 2020 to help them cover costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Professional services expense increased in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily due to expenses relating to pending acquisitions and overall growth in the business. 

Occupancy and equipment expense increased in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily due to an increase in technology equipment costs associated with higher customer trade volumes. 

Communications expense increased in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily due to higher customer trade volumes as well as overall growth in our business and client base. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses grew in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily due to higher depreciation of buildings and equipment related to expansion of our campuses in the U.S. in 2019 and 2020, as well as higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software associated with continued investments in software and technology enhancements. 

Other expenses increased in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily resulting from increases in processing fees and related expenses due to higher customer trade volumes and market volatility, as well as expenses relating to pending acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expense. 

Capital expenditures were $250 million and $181 million in the first quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures from the prior year was primarily due to higher capitalized software costs, partially offset by lower building expansion in 2020 relative to the first quarter of 2019. Excluding any potential impact of the pending acquisition of TD Ameritrade, we anticipate capital expenditures for full-year 2020 to be approximately 5-6% of total net revenues.

Taxes on Income 

Taxes on income were $252 million and $300 million for the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 , respectively, resulting in effective income tax rates on income before taxes of 24.1% and 23.7% , respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year was due to a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits and an increase in nondeductible acquisition costs, partially offset by state-related tax benefits recognized during the first quarter of 2020.

(1) In the first quarter of 2020, order flow revenue was reclassified from other revenue to trading revenue. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change. 

Investor Services 

Total net revenues decreased by 2% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily due to decreases in net interest revenue, trading revenue and other revenue, partially offset by an increase in asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue decreased primarily due to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets. Trading revenue decreased primarily as a result of the Company&#8217;s 2019 pricing actions, partially offset by higher trading volume. The decrease in other revenue was primarily driven by a gain recognized in the first quarter of 2019 from the assignment of leased office space, as well as an increase in the allowance for credit losses on bank loans in the first quarter of 2020. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to increased balances in purchased money market funds and advice solutions. 

Expenses excluding interest increased by 9% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, professional services, depreciation and amortization, and other expenses. Compensation and benefits increased in the first quarter or 2020 due to annual merit increases and increased headcount to support our expanding client base, as well as the Company&#8217;s payment of $1,000 to all non-officer employees in March 2020 to help them cover costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Professional services also increased, driven by expenses related to pending acquisitions and overall growth in the business. Depreciation and amortization increased due to higher depreciation of buildings and equipment related to our campus expansion, as well as higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software associated with continued investments in software and technology enhancements. Other expenses increased due to increased processing fees associated with higher customer trade volumes and expenses related to pending acquisitions, partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expenses.

Advisor Services 

Total net revenues decreased by 8% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily due to decreases in net interest revenue, trading revenue, and other revenue, partially offset by an increase in asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue decreased primarily due to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets. Trading revenue decreased primarily as a result of the Company&#8217;s 2019 pricing actions, partially offset by higher trading volume. The decrease in other revenue was primarily driven by a gain recognized in the first quarter of 2019 from the assignment of leased office space. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to increased balances in purchased money market funds. 

Expenses excluding interest increased by 5% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense as well as higher depreciation and amortization expense. Compensation and benefits increased in the first quarter of 2020 due to annual merit increases and increased headcount to support our expanding client base, as well as the Company&#8217;s payment of $1,000 to all non-officer employees in March 2020 to help them cover costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to higher depreciation of buildings and equipment related to our campus expansion, as well as higher amortization of internally developed software associated with continued investments in software and technology enhancements. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Schwab&#8217;s business activities expose us to a variety of risks, including operational, credit, market, liquidity, and compliance risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. For a discussion of our risk management programs, see Item 7 &#8211; Risk Management in the 2019 Form 10-K. 

Net Interest Revenue Simulation 

For our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulations include all interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, repricing of financial instruments, and reinvestment of matured or paid-down securities and loans. 

Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets primarily include investment securities, margin loans and bank loans. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. Because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans, and control the composition of our investment securities, we have some ability to manage our net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions. 

Net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next 12 months beginning March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period:

The change in net interest revenue sensitivities as of March 31, 2020 reflects a significantly lower interest rate curve from the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the global economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher short-term interest rates would

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interest earning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources. A decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the Company&#8217;s investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources, compressing net interest margin. 

In addition to measuring the effect of a gradual 100 basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates, we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel- and non-parallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue. 

Economic Value of Equity Simulation 

Management also uses economic value of equity (EVE) simulations to measure interest rate risk. EVE sensitivity measures the long-term impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment. Key assumptions in our EVE calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, term structure models of interest rates, non-maturity deposit behavior, and pricing assumptions. 

As a result of the low interest rate environment in the first quarter of 2020, the downward assessments of our net interest revenue and EVE simulations as of March 31, 2020 reflected the assumption of non-negative investment yields. 

Expected Phase-out of LIBOR 

The Company has established a firm-wide team to address the likely discontinuation of LIBOR. As part of our efforts, we have inventoried our LIBOR exposures, the largest of which are certain investment securities and loans. In purchasing new investment securities, we ensure that appropriate fall-back language is in the security&#8217;s prospectus in the event that LIBOR is unavailable or deemed unreliable. We are updating loan agreements to ensure new LIBOR-based loans adequately provide for an alternative to LIBOR. Furthermore, we plan to phase-out the use of LIBOR as a reference rate in our new lending products before December 2021. Consistent with our &#8220;Through Clients&#8217; Eyes&#8221; strategy, our focus throughout the LIBOR transition process is to ensure clients are treated fairly and consistently as this major change is occurring in the financial markets. The market transition process has not yet progressed to a point at which the impact to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements of LIBOR&#8217;s discontinuation can be estimated. 

Liquidity Risk 

Funding Sources 

Schwab&#8217;s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients. 

Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, repurchase agreements, and cash provided by external financing. 

&#160; 

To meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments, including U.S. Treasury securities.

Acquisition of USAA-IMCO 

We expect to utilize cash generated from operations to fund the $1.8 billion purchase of assets from USAA-IMCO. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2020, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the implementation of conversion plans. 

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

Schwab seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of our business strategy, including anticipated balance sheet growth, providing financial support to our subsidiaries, and sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to our banking subsidiaries. Schwab&#8217;s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets. To ensure that Schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios. In addition, our near-term capital management incorporates preparations for closing the USAA-IMCO transaction, including the allocation of capital to support client cash that will be added to our balance sheet. 

As a result of the significant inflow of client cash in the first quarter of 2020, our consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio declined from 7.3% at year-end 2019 to 6.9% at March 31, 2020. While we continue to maintain our long-term operating objective of 6.75%-7.00%, our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is likely to decline further into the buffer we maintain between our long-term operating objective and our regulatory requirement. Moreover, our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio may remain below the level seen at March 31, 2020 in coming quarters before returning to our operating objective over time. We expect to continue managing our capital position in accordance with our policy and strategy described above and in further detail in the 2019 Form 10-K. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

CSC and CSB are subject to various capital requirements set by regulatory agencies as discussed in further detail in the 2019 Form 10-K and in Item 1 &#8211; Note 14. As of March 31, 2020 , CSC and CSB are considered well capitalized.

(1) In the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules adopted in October 2019, Category III banking organizations such as CSC were given the ability to opt-out of the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital, and CSC made this opt-out election as of January 1, 2020. Therefore, AOCI is excluded from the amounts and ratios presented as of March 31, 2020. In 2019, CSC and CSB were required to include all components of AOCI in regulatory capital; the amounts and ratios for December 31, 2019 are presented on this basis. 

CSB is also subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions. In addition, CSB is required to provide notice to, and may be required to obtain approval from, the Federal Reserve to declare dividends to CSC. 

As a broker-dealer, CS&#38;Co is subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule. At March 31, 2020 , CS&#38;Co was in compliance with its net capital requirements. 

In addition to the capital requirements above, Schwab&#8217;s subsidiaries are subject to other regulatory requirements intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity. See Item 1 &#8211; Note 14 for additional information on the components of stockholders&#8217; equity and information on the capital requirements of significant subsidiaries.
