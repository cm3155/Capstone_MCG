 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

INTRODUCTION 

The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC) is a savings and loan holding company and engages, through its subsidiaries, in wealth management, securities brokerage, banking, asset management, custody, and financial advisory services. 

Principal business subsidiaries of CSC include the following: 

&#8226; Charles Schwab &#38; Co., Inc. (CS&#38;Co), incorporated in 1971, a securities broker-dealer; 

&#8226; TD Ameritrade, Inc., an introducing securities broker-dealer; 

&#8226; TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc. (TDAC), a securities broker-dealer that provides trade execution and clearing services to TD Ameritrade, Inc.; 

&#8226; Charles Schwab Bank, SSB (CSB), our principal banking entity; and 

&#8226; Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (CSIM), the investment advisor for Schwab&#8217;s proprietary mutual funds (Schwab Funds &#174; ) and for Schwab&#8217;s exchange-traded funds (Schwab ETFs &#8482; ). 

Unless otherwise indicated, the terms &#8220;Schwab,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; mean CSC together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 

Schwab provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments &#8211; Investor Services and Advisor Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors, and retirement plan services, as well as other corporate brokerage services, to businesses and their employees. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking, and support services, as well as retirement business services, to independent registered investment advisors (RIAs), independent retirement advisors, and recordkeepers. 

Effective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (TDA Holding) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively referred to as &#8220;TD Ameritrade&#8221; or &#8220;TDA&#8221;). TD Ameritrade provides securities brokerage services, including trade execution, clearing services, and margin lending, through its broker-dealer subsidiaries; and futures and foreign exchange trade execution services through its futures commission merchant (FCM) and forex dealer member (FDM) subsidiary. The TD Ameritrade acquisition is further described in the business and asset acquisition discussion below. Our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations and financial condition of TD Ameritrade beginning on October 6, 2020. 

Schwab was founded on the belief that all Americans deserve access to a better investing experience. Although much has changed in the intervening years, our purpose remains clear &#8211; to champion every client&#8217;s goals with passion and integrity. Guided by this purpose and our vision of creating the most trusted leader in investment services, management has adopted a strategy described as &#8220;Through Clients&#8217; Eyes.&#8221; 

This strategy emphasizes placing clients&#8217; perspectives, needs, and desires at the forefront. Because investing plays a fundamental role in building financial security, we strive to deliver a better investing experience for our clients &#8211; individual investors and the people and institutions who serve them &#8211; by disrupting longstanding industry practices on their behalf and providing superior service. We also aim to offer a broad range of products and solutions to meet client needs with a focus on transparency, value, and trust. In addition, management works to couple Schwab&#8217;s scale and resources with ongoing expense discipline to keep costs low and ensure that products and solutions are affordable as well as responsive to client needs. In combination, these are the key elements of our &#8220;no trade-offs&#8221; approach to serving investors. We believe that following this strategy is the best way to maximize our market valuation and stockholder returns over time. 

Management estimates that investable wealth in the United States (U.S.) (consisting of assets in defined contribution, retail wealth management and brokerage, and registered investment advisor channels, along with bank deposits) currently exceeds $60 trillion, which means the Company&#8217;s $7.07 trillion in total client assets leaves substantial opportunity for growth. Our strategy is based on the principle that developing trusted relationships will translate into more assets from both new and existing clients, ultimately driving more revenue, and along with expense discipline and thoughtful capital management, will generate earnings growth and build long-term stockholder value.

Schwab saw an unprecedented operating environment during the first three months of 2021. The U.S. economic recovery advanced, supported by expanding COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and government aid packages, and the equity markets continued to rise, with the S&#38;P 500 &#174; rising 78% between the pandemic-driven low in March 2020 and the end of the first quarter of 2021. Interest rates began to lift as well, with the 10-year Treasury yield moving to 1.74% by quarter-end &#8211; its highest level since January 2020. 

This environment contributed to another rise in client engagement and activity. Clients opened 3.2 million new brokerage accounts, exceeding our total for all of 2020, exclusive of the accounts we acquired as part of our 2020 acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and USAA&#8217;s Investment Management Company (USAA-IMCO). Daily average trades (DATs) rose considerably to

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

8.4 million in the first three months of 2021, rising 45% from the average of 5.8 million seen in the fourth quarter of 2020. Amidst this surge in activity, core net new assets totaled $148.2 billion in the first quarter of 2021, rising 102% from the first quarter of 2020 and 24% higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. Total client assets ended the first quarter of 2021 at $7.07 trillion, up 102% from March 31, 2020 and up 6% from year-end 2020. 

With significantly heightened client activity levels during the first quarter of 2021, our service quality was impacted at times. As a result, we took multiple steps to better deliver the service experience our clients deserve and rely on, including enhancing online self-service capabilities, streamlining our call-routing processes, and increasing hiring, including 10% growth in client service professionals since year-end 2020. Our efforts were already yielding results by quarter-end, with significant improvement in client service levels. 

Against this market and client activity backdrop, Schwab generated strong financial results during the first three months of 2021. Net income totaled $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2021, up 87% from the first quarter of 2020, and the Company produced diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $.73, up 26% from the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted diluted EPS (1) , which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and related income tax effects, amounted to $.84, up 38% from the first quarter of 2020. These increases from the first quarter of 2020 were due largely to our October 6, 2020 acquisition of TD Ameritrade. 

Total net revenues were $4.7 billion in the first quarter of 2021, up 80% from the first quarter of 2020, as TD Ameritrade contributed total net revenues of $2.2 billion. Total net revenues increased 13% from the fourth quarter of 2020, driven primarily by higher trading revenue and higher net interest revenue. 

Net interest revenue totaled $1.9 billion in the first quarter, up 22% from the first quarter of 2020 and up 6% from the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase from the first quarter of 2020 reflected the inclusion of TD Ameritrade, which contributed $548 million of net interest revenue in the first quarter of 2021. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2020 was largely due to elevated margin loan utilization and higher overall interest-earning assets stemming from rising client cash balances. These factors more than offset the ongoing impacts of the Fed&#8217;s Zero Interest Rate Policy, including elevated prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. Asset management and administration fees totaled $1.0 billion, up 23% from the first quarter of 2020, due largely to the contribution of $142 million from TD Ameritrade in the first quarter of 2021, as well as overall growth in advice solutions balances including managed account assets from USAA, partially offset by money market fund fee waivers. Asset management and administration fees grew 3% from the fourth quarter of 2020 as growth in advisory solution balances and strong equity markets more than offset a $10 million increase in money market fund fee waivers. 

Trading revenue was $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2021, up from $188 million in the first quarter of 2020 and up from $854 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The significant increase in the first quarter of 2021 reflected early-2021 market events on top of an already busy trading environment, as DATs increased significantly. TD Ameritrade contributed $980 million of trading revenue in the first quarter of 2021. Bank deposit account fee revenue totaled $351 million in the first quarter of 2021, decreasing 1% from the fourth quarter of 2020. Bank deposit account balances (BDA balances) remained relatively consistent from December 31, 2020, and certain balances repriced to current rates. 

Total expenses excluding interest were $2.8 billion in the first quarter of 2021, increasing 75% from the first quarter of 2020 due primarily to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade&#8217;s results, which contributed $917 million. Total expenses excluding interest increased 2% from the fourth quarter of 2020 reflecting the impact of extraordinary client activity alongside anticipated integration spending and increased headcount to support our expanding client base. Acquisition and integration-related costs totaled $119 million in the first quarter of 2021, and amortization of acquired intangible assets was $154 million. Exclusive of these items, adjusted total expenses (1) were $2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2021, up 63% and 9% from the first and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively. Return on average common stockholders&#8217; equity was 12% for the first quarter of 2021, down from 14% in the first quarter of 2020, as the return generated from higher net income was offset by higher balances of common stockholders&#8217; equity due to the TD Ameritrade acquisition. Return on tangible common equity (1) (ROTCE) was 24% in the first quarter of 2021, up from 16% in the first quarter of 2020, due primarily to higher net income. 

(1) Adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted total expenses, and return on tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

The Company continued its disciplined approach to capital management in the first quarter of 2021. During the first quarter, we completed two preferred stock offerings: Series I for $2.25 billion and Series J for $600 million. As previously announced, proceeds from the Series J preferred stock issuance will be used to redeem our $600 million Series C preferred stock on June 1, 2021. In addition, we issued 3- and 7-year senior notes totaling $4.0 billion in March 2021. Our priority for capital management remains centered on maintaining flexibility to support ongoing growth while also helping us move towards our long-term Tier 1 Leverage Ratio operating objective of 6.75%-7.00%. Schwab&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet assets were $563 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2021, up 3% from year-end 2020, and our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio increased to 6.4%. 

Integration of TD Ameritrade 

Against a backdrop of unprecedented client activity and volume growth in the first quarter of 2021, the Company continued its integration of TD Ameritrade. As a result of the significant growth seen in recent quarters across key client volume metrics, including the number of active brokerage accounts, DATs, and peak daily trades, the Company is expanding the scope of technology work related to the integration. We anticipate greater technology build-out to support the expanded volumes of our combined client base. Based on our revised integration plans and expanded scope of technology work, the Company expects to complete client conversion within 30 to 36 months from the date of acquisition, and we expect to incur total acquisition and integration-related costs and capital expenditures of between $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion. 

The Company&#8217;s estimates of the nature, amounts, and timing of recognition of acquisition and integration-related costs remain subject to change based on a number of factors, including the expected duration and complexity of the integration process and the heightened uncertainty of the current economic environment. More specifically, factors that could cause variability in our expected acquisition and integration-related costs include the level of employee attrition, workforce redeployment from eliminated positions into open roles, changes in the levels of client activity, as well as increased real estate-related exit cost variability due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Over the course of the integration, we continue to expect to realize annualized cost synergies of between $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion, with one-quarter to one-third on an annualized run-rate basis expected by the end of the first year following acquisition. Estimated timing and amounts of synergy realization are subject to change as we progress in the integration. Refer to Item 7 &#8211; Overview in our 2020 Form 10-K and Item 1 &#8211; Note 11 for additional information regarding our integration of TD Ameritrade. 

Current Regulatory Environment and Other Developments 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

As a result of our average weighted short-term wholesale funding for the past four quarters exceeding $75 billion, we will become subject to daily reporting of our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) to the Federal Reserve on July 1, 2021, and to the full (100%) LCR and NSFR (up from 85%) on October 1, 2021. 

Financial Holding Company Election 

On March 16, 2021, CSC&#8217;s declaration electing to be treated as a Financial Holding Company (FHC) was deemed effective by the Federal Reserve. In addition to the activities that savings and loan holding companies that have not elected to be treated as an FHC are permitted to conduct, the Company may now also engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity (FHC Activities), including securities underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities, various insurance underwriting activities, and making merchant banking investments in non-financial companies. 

The Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an FHC&#8217;s ability to conduct otherwise permissible FHC Activities if the FHC or any of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet the applicable eligibility requirements, including requirements that the FHC and each of its depository institution subsidiaries maintain their status as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well-managed.&#8221; If the Federal Reserve finds that an FHC fails to meet these requirements, the FHC and its subsidiaries may not commence any new FHC Activity, either de novo or through an acquisition, without prior Federal Reserve approval. The Federal Reserve may also impose any additional limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of the FHC or any of its subsidiaries as it deems appropriate. If the FHC still fails to satisfy the applicable eligibility requirements 180 days after the Federal Reserve&#8217;s finding, the agency may require divestiture of all of the FHC&#8217;s depository institution subsidiaries or, alternatively, the FHC may elect to cease all of its FHC Activities. In addition, if any depository institution controlled by an FHC fails to maintain at least a

&#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the FHC and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in additional FHC Activities.

N/M Not meaningful. Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful. 

Net Interest Revenue 

Revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and loans, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and loans. 

Throughout the first quarter of 2021, short-term rates remained near zero, but as the U.S. economic recovery advanced, longer-term interest rates began to rise. The overall environment continued to contribute to elevated levels of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities, resulting in additional reinvestment of the available for sale (AFS) portfolio during the period. Client engagement in the equity markets greatly increased, and clients were net buyers of equity securities and other investment products during the first quarter. At the same time, Schwab saw significant growth in new client brokerage accounts and net new client assets, driving further growth in Schwab&#8217;s interest-earning assets.

(2) Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, securities lending revenue has been reclassified from broker-related receivables and other revenue. Securities lending expense has been reclassified from other expense. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change. 

(3) Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, broker-related receivables were removed from total interest earning assets and netted against non-interest-bearing funding sources, resulting in an immaterial reduction to total interest-earning assets and total funding sources. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change. 

(4) Interest revenue or expense was less than $500 thousand in the period or periods presented. 

Net interest revenue increased $339 million, or 22%, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, due primarily to growth in interest-earning assets, including elevated margin utilization, and growth in securities lending revenue, partially offset by lower average yields. Accelerated premium amortization stemming from the elevated prepayment of mortgage-related debt securities in the AFS portfolio partially offset the growth in net interest revenue. TD Ameritrade contributed $548 million of net interest revenue during the first quarter of 2021. 

Average interest-earning assets for the first quarter of 2021 were higher by 77% compared to the same period in 2020. This increase resulted from higher bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients, due to rising client cash balances driven by the low interest rate environment and strong net new client cash inflows, as well as our 2020 acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and USAA-IMCO. 

Our net interest margin decreased to 1.48% during the first quarter of 2021, from 2.14% in the same period of 2020. This decrease was driven primarily by lower yields received on interest-earning assets due largely to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s first quarter 2020 interest rate reductions as well as higher premium amortization on mortgage-related debt securities. Due to the low interest rate environment, purchases of investment securities throughout 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 were made at rates below the average yield on AFS portfolio, which negatively impacted our net interest margin. This more than offset higher revenue from increased margin utilization and securities lending, which comprised 40% of net interest revenue during the first quarter of 2021, up from 13% in the first quarter of 2020.

(4) Includes miscellaneous service and transaction fees relating to mutual funds and ETFs that are not balance-based. 

Asset management and administration fees increased by $189 million, or 23%, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. This increase was due to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade, as well as additional growth in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA, and overall strength in the equity markets during the first quarter of 2021 relative to the same period in 2020. These increases were partially offset by the effect of money market fund fee waivers due to declining portfolio yields. TD Ameritrade contributed $142 million of asset management and administration fees in the first quarter of 2021. The amount of fee waivers in coming quarters is dependent on a variety of factors, including the level of short-term interest rates and client preferences across our money market fund line-up.

$ 2.37 $ 1.97 20 % 

(1) Revenue per trade is calculated as trading revenue divided by DATs multiplied by the number of trading days. 

N/M Not meaningful. Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful. 

Trading revenue increased $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and heightened client engagement, which together drove significantly higher DATs. This increased trading activity drove significant growth in both commissions and order flow revenue. Overall, TD Ameritrade contributed $980 million of trading revenue in the first quarter of 2021. 

Bank Deposit Account Fees 

Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company began earning bank deposit account fee revenue pursuant to the Insured Deposit Account agreement (IDA agreement) with TD Bank USA, National Association and TD Bank, National Association (together, the TD Depository Institutions) and arrangements with other third-party banks. Bank deposit account fees are primarily affected by average BDA balances and floating- and fixed-rate reference yields. Fees earned under the IDA agreement are affected by changes in interest rates and the composition of balances designated as fixed- and floating-rate. 

Bank deposit account fees totaled $351 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021. During this period, the total average BDA balance was $166.8 billion, of which approximately 80% was designated as fixed-rate obligation amounts and approximately 20% as floating-rate obligation amounts. 

Other Revenue 

Other revenue includes exchange processing fees, certain service fees, software fees, and non-recurring gains. Other revenue increased $191 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade as well as higher exchange processing fees resulting from higher trade volumes.

N/M Not meaningful. Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful. 

Expenses excluding interest increased $1.2 billion, or 75%, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, total expenses excluding interest included $917 million from TD Ameritrade. Adjusted total expenses, which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets, increased $955 million, or 63%, in the first quarter of 2021 compared the same period in 2020. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results. 

Total compensation and benefits increased in the first quarter of 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to an overall increase in employee headcount, driven primarily by our acquisition of TD Ameritrade. The increase was also due to additional headcount to support our expanding client base and service levels amidst heightened client engagement, as well as annual merit increases and higher bonus accrual. Compensation and benefits in the first quarter of 2021 included $72 million of acquisition and integration-related costs, up from $8 million in the first quarter of 2020. 

Professional services expense increased in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA&#8217;s results of operations and overall growth in the business. Professional services expense included $27 million of acquisition and integration-related costs, increasing from $23 million in the first quarter of 2020. 

Occupancy and equipment expense increased in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA&#8217;s results of operations and costs related to the integration of TD Ameritrade, as well as an increase in technology equipment costs associated with higher customer trade volumes and overall growth in the business. 

Advertising and market development expense increased in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA&#8217;s results of operations.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

Communications expense increased in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due the inclusion of TDA&#8217;s results of operations, as well as higher communications expenses due to higher customer trade volumes and overall growth of the business. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses grew in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily resulting from growth in fixed assets due to the TDA acquisition, higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software, and higher depreciation of buildings related to expansion of our campuses in the U.S. Amortization of acquired intangible assets increased in 2021 as a result of acquisitions completed in 2020. 

Regulatory fees and assessments increased in the first quarter of 2021 primarily as a result of the inclusion of TDA&#8217;s results of operations and overall growth in the business, including higher FDIC assessments due to asset growth. 

Other expense increased in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due the inclusion of TDA&#8217;s results of operations and increases in processing fees and related expenses due to higher customer trade volumes and market volatility. 

Capital expenditures were $209 million and $250 million in the first quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures from the prior year was primarily due to lower building expansion and lower capitalized software costs in 2021, partially offset by higher hardware costs relative to the first three months of 2020. We anticipate capital expenditures for full-year 2021 to be approximately 6-7% of total net revenues. 

Taxes on Income 

Taxes on income were $476 million and $252 million for the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulting in effective income tax rates on income before taxes of 24.3% and 24.1%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily due to the impact of state rate changes on the Company&#8217;s deferred tax liabilities during the first quarter of 2021, increased state tax expense due to uncertain tax position accruals, and state-related tax benefits recognized during the first quarter of 2020. Partially offsetting the increase in the effective tax rate from these items was an increase in equity compensation tax benefits during the first quarter of 2021.

Segment Net Revenues 

Investor Services and Advisor Services total net revenues increased by 100% and 32%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter in 2020, primarily due to our October 6, 2020 acquisition of TD Ameritrade, as both segments saw growth in all revenue line items. The increase in net interest revenue in both segments was due to growth in interest-

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

earning assets, partially offset by lower average yields. Growth in asset management and administration fees in Investor Services was supported by growth in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA, and asset management and administration fees grew in both segments as a result of overall strength in the equity markets, partially offset by money market fund fee waivers. The increase in trading revenue for both segments was also supported by a significant increase in client trading activity. Bank deposit account fee revenue was earned at both segments during the first quarter of 2021, following the TDA acquisition. 

Segment Expenses Excluding Interest 

Investor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 83% and 55%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter in 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade&#8217;s results of operations and higher customer trade volume. In addition, both segments saw higher compensation and benefits expenses due to additional increases in headcount to support our expanding client base and service levels amidst heightened client engagement, as well as annual merit increases and higher bonus accrual. For Investor Services, total expenses excluding interest also increased as a result of our hiring former USAA employees in connection with the 2020 acquisition of assets of USAA-IMCO. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Schwab&#8217;s business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. 

As part of our integration of TD Ameritrade, the Company is aligning TD Ameritrade&#8217;s historical risk exposures with Schwab&#8217;s risk appetite. Our integration work includes evaluating new or changed risks impacting the combined company, and may involve modifications to our existing risk management processes. Though integration work continues, the Company&#8217;s operations, inclusive of TD Ameritrade, remain consistent with our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework. 

For a discussion of our risk management programs, see Item 7 &#8211; Risk Management in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

Interest Rate Risk Simulations 

Net Interest Revenue Simulation 

For our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulations include all balance sheet interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, repricing of financial instruments, and reinvestment of matured or paid-down securities and loans. 

Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets include investment securities, margin loans, and bank loans. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. Because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans, and control the composition of our investment securities, we have some ability to manage our net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions. 

Net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 

The following table shows the simulated change to net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period: 

March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Increase of 100 basis points 14.2 % 14.2 % Decrease of 100 basis points (4.2) % (4.3) % 

Net interest revenue sensitivities as of March 31, 2021 remained relatively consistent with December 31, 2020, due to the continued low interest rate environment. Higher short-term interest rates would positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interest-earning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources. A decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the Company&#8217;s investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources, compressing net interest margin. 

In addition to measuring the effect of a gradual 100 basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates, we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel- and non-parallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue. 

Bank Deposit Account Fees Simulation 

Consistent with the presentation on the consolidated statement of income, the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the net interest revenue simulation described above. As of March 31, 2021, simulated changes in bank deposit account fee revenue from gradual 100 basis point changes in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates did not have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s total net revenues. 

Economic Value of Equity Simulation 

Management also uses economic value of equity (EVE) simulations to measure interest rate risk. EVE sensitivity measures the long-term impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment. Key assumptions in our EVE calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, term structure models of interest rates, non-maturity deposit behavior, and pricing assumptions. Our net interest revenue, bank deposit account fee revenue, and EVE simulations reflect the assumption of non-negative investment yields. 

Phase-out of LIBOR 

The Company has established a firm-wide team to address the phasing-out of LIBOR. As part of our efforts, we have assessed our LIBOR exposures, the largest of which are certain investment securities and loans. In purchasing new investment securities, we ensure that appropriate fall-back language is in the security&#8217;s prospectus in the event that LIBOR is unavailable or deemed unreliable, and we have sold certain securities lacking appropriate fall-back language. We are updating loan agreements to ensure new LIBOR-based loans adequately provide for an alternative to LIBOR. Furthermore, we plan to phase-out the use of LIBOR as a reference rate in our new lending products before the end of December 2021, per guidance from the Federal Reserve Board. 

Liquidity Risk 

Funding Sources 

Schwab&#8217;s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients. 

Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, repurchase agreements, and cash provided by external financing.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

Schwab seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of our business strategy, including anticipated balance sheet growth inclusive of migration of IDA balances (see further discussion below), providing financial support to our subsidiaries, and sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to our banking subsidiaries. Schwab&#8217;s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets. To ensure that Schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios. 

As a result of significant inflows of client cash in 2020, our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio declined below our long-term operating objective for consolidated CSC of 6.75%-7.00%, ending 2020 at 6.3%. Due to our March 2021 issuances of preferred stock and strength in earnings in the first quarter of 2021, our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio increased to 6.4% at March 31, 2021. Though still below our long-term operating objective, this ratio is well above the regulatory minimum. The pace of return to our long-term operating objective over time depends on a number of factors including the overall size of the Company&#8217;s balance sheet, earnings, and capital issuance and deployment. We continue to manage our capital position in accordance with our policy and strategy described above and in further detail in our 2020 Form 10-K.

CSB is also subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions. In addition, CSB is required to provide notice to, and may be required to obtain approval from, the Federal Reserve and the Texas Department of Savings and Mortgage Lending (TDSML) to declare dividends to CSC. 

As broker-dealers, CS&#38;Co, TDAC, and TD Ameritrade, Inc. are subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which is intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers. At March 31, 2021, CS&#38;Co, TDAC, and TD Ameritrade, Inc. were in compliance with their respective net capital requirements. 

In addition to the capital requirements above, Schwab&#8217;s subsidiaries are subject to other regulatory requirements intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity. See Item 1 &#8211; Note 17 for additional information on the components of stockholders&#8217; equity and information on the capital requirements of significant subsidiaries. 

IDA Agreement 

Pursuant to the IDA agreement, Schwab will move uninsured IDA balances out of the IDA sweep program on June 30, 2021. The IDA agreement also provides that, starting July 1, 2021, Schwab will have the option to migrate up to $10 billion of IDA balances every 12 months to Schwab&#8217;s balance sheet, subject to certain limitations and adjustments. The Company&#8217;s overall capital management strategy includes supporting migration of the uninsured IDA balances on June 30, 2021 as well as optional IDA balances in future periods as available pursuant to the terms of the IDA agreement. The Company&#8217;s ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent upon multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and the availability of IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations. See Note 10 for further information on the IDA agreement.

Share Repurchases 

On January 30, 2019, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.0 billion of common stock. The authorization does not have an expiration date. There were no repurchases of CSC&#8217;s common stock under this authorization during the first quarter of 2021 or 2020. As of March 31, 2021, $1.8 billion remained on our existing authorization. 

OTHER 

Foreign Exposure 

At March 31, 2021, Schwab had exposure to non-sovereign financial and non-financial institutions in foreign countries, as well as agencies of foreign governments. At March 31, 2021, the fair value of these holdings totaled $8.1 billion, with the top three exposures being to issuers and counterparties domiciled in France at $4.7 billion, Germany at $1.2 billion, and Canada at $873 million. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of these holdings totaled $10.1 billion, with the top three exposures being to issuers and counterparties domiciled in France at $6.7 billion, Germany at $1.2 billion, and Canada at $880 million. In addition, Schwab had outstanding margin loans to foreign residents of $4.7 billion and $2.2 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Outstanding margin loans to foreign residents at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 include $3.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, attributable to the inclusion of TDA balances. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Schwab enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, Schwab enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see Item 1 &#8211; Notes 6, 7, 9, 10, and 12. Concurrent with the closing of the acquisition of TD Ameritrade effective October 6, 2020, the IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions became effective. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, certain brokerage client deposits are required to be swept off-balance sheet to the TD Depository Institutions. TD Ameritrade also maintains agreements

pursuant to which client brokerage cash deposits are swept to other third-party depository institutions. See Item 1 &#8211; Note 10 for additional information on the IDA agreement. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

Certain of our accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity are discussed in Part II &#8211; Item 7 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2020 Form 10-K. There have been no changes to critical accounting estimates during the first three months of 2021. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with GAAP, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain references to the non-GAAP financial measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the Company, and facilitate meaningful comparison of Schwab&#8217;s results in the current period to both historic and future results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. 

Schwab&#8217;s use of non-GAAP measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to GAAP financial measures as described below. 

Non-GAAP Adjustment or Measure Definition Usefulness to Investors and Uses by Management Acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets Schwab adjusts certain GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of acquisition and integration-related costs incurred as a result of the Company&#8217;s acquisitions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and, where applicable, the income tax effect of these expenses. Adjustments made to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets are reflective of all acquired intangible assets, which were recorded as part of purchase accounting. These acquired intangible assets contribute to the Company&#8217;s revenue generation. Amortization of acquired intangible assets will continue in future periods over their remaining useful lives. We exclude acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets for the purpose of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe doing so provides additional transparency of Schwab&#8217;s ongoing operations, and is useful in both evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating comparison of results with prior and future periods. Acquisition and integration-related costs fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and integration activities, thereby limiting comparability of results among periods, and are not representative of the costs of running the Company&#8217;s ongoing business. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of the Company&#8217;s underlying operating performance. Return on tangible common equity Return on tangible common equity represents annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill, acquired intangible assets &#8211; net, and related deferred tax liabilities. Acquisitions typically result in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible assets. We believe return on tangible common equity may be useful to investors as a supplemental measure to facilitate assessing capital efficiency and returns relative to the composition of Schwab&#8217;s balance sheet. 

Beginning in 2021, the Company also uses adjusted diluted EPS and return on tangible common equity as components of performance criteria for employee bonus and certain executive management incentive compensation arrangements. The Compensation Committee of CSC&#8217;s Board of Directors maintains discretion in evaluating performance against these criteria.
