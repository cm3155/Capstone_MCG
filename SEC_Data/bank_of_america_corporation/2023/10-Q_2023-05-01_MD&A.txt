 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Bank of America Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) and its management may make certain statements that constitute &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.

Recent Developments 

Capital Management 

On April 26, 2023, the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors (the Board) declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.22 per share, payable on June 30, 2023 to shareholders of record as of June 2, 2023. 

For more information on our capital resources, see Capital Management on page 17. 

Financial Market Events 

In March 2023, the global financial system experienced increased volatility due to the failure of certain financial institutions. At March 31, 2023, Bank of America&#8217;s direct exposure to these financial institutions was not significant. 

To help deploy financial strength and liquidity into the larger banking system, Bank of America and certain other U.S. financial institutions made uninsured deposits totaling $30 billion into First Republic Bank. The amount of Bank of America&#8217;s uninsured deposit was $5 billion and is recorded in Time deposits placed and other short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

On May 1, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced that it was appointed as receiver of First Republic Bank and entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (JPMorgan Chase Bank) to assume all of the deposits and substantially all of the assets of First Republic Bank. As a result, Bank of America has become a depositor of JPMorgan Chase Bank with regard to its $5 billion uninsured deposit originally deposited into First Republic Bank. 

The potential impacts of rising interest rates and continued deposit outflows on global markets , financial institutions and macroeconomic conditions, generally, remain uncertain. Episodes of increased economic and market volatility may continue to occur and could worsen if there are additional instances of actual or threatened bank failures, which could adversely affect the Corporation&#8217;s businesses, results of operations and financial condition. For more information on the risks related to rising interest rates, declining asset values and liquidity, see the Market, Liquidity and Credit sections within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

U.S. Government Debt Ceiling 

In response to the upcoming U.S. government&#8217;s deadline to raise the debt ceiling, the Corporation has implemented protocols and processes to prepare for the impacts that could begin in the period leading up to a potential breach of the U.S. government&#8217;s debt ceiling and increasing in severity if a default occurs. The Corporation is monitoring these potential events through regular routines. For more information on the risks related to a potential U.S. government debt ceiling breach, see the Market and Geopolitical sections within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates 

The Corporation and the global financial markets continue to make progress with respect to the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs) to alternative reference rates (ARRs). As previously disclosed, the remaining U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings (i.e., overnight, one month, three month, six month and 12 month) will cease or become non-representative immediately after June 30, 2023, although the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced on April 3, 2023 that it will require LIBOR&#8217;s administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, to continue publication of the one-month, three-month and six-month USD LIBOR settings on a &#8220;synthetic&#8221; basis (calculated using the relevant CME Term SOFR Reference Rate plus the respective International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) fixed spread adjustment) for use in legacy contracts and that it intends for such publication to cease on September 30, 2024. 

In April 2023, certain central counterparties (CCPs) completed processes to convert certain outstanding USD LIBOR-cleared derivatives to ARR positions, and the Corporation expects those CCPs will convert remaining USD LIBOR-cleared derivatives to ARR positions in the second quarter of 2023. In March 2023, the Corporation announced that after June 30, 2023, the relevant CME Term SOFR Reference Rate, plus the respective ISDA fixed spread adjustment, will be the replacement reference rate for certain outstanding floating rate and fixed-to-floating rate debt securities, preferred stock represented by depositary shares and trust preferred securities issued by the Corporation, BofA Finance LLC and certain other affiliated issuers (USD LIBOR Securities) that use USD LIBOR as the reference rate and are governed by New York and Delaware law. For more information on the Corporation&#8217;s replacement of relevant USD LIBOR rates of certain USD LIBOR Securities, see the Corporation&#8217;s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023. Additionally, as the Corporation continues to transition IBOR-based products to various ARRs, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), it has increased the use of those ARRs in its baseline forecast of net interest income. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 40. 

For more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, including the Corporation&#8217;s efforts and overall progress with respect to LIBOR transition, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates in the MD&#38;A and Item 1A.

For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to the most closely related financial measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 43. 

Net income was $8.2 billion, or $0.94 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $7.1 billion, or $0.80 per diluted share, for the same period in 2022. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher net interest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. 

Bank of America 4 

Total assets increased $143.3 billion from December 31, 2022 to $3.2 trillion primarily driven by higher cash and cash equivalents due to securities financing activity to support balance sheet and liquidity positioning, as well as higher trading account assets to support Global Markets client activity. 

Total liabilities increased $136.3 billion from December 31, 2022 to $2.9 trillion primarily driven by higher securities financing activity and short-term borrowings to support balance sheet and liquidity positioning, partially offset by lower deposits primarily due to customers&#8217; movement of balances to higher yielding investment alternatives. 

Shareholders&#8217; equity increased $7.0 billion from December 31, 2022 primarily due to net income and market value increases on derivatives, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through common and preferred stock dividends and common stock repurchases. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income increased $2.9 billion to $14.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis increased 51 basis points (bps) to 2.20 percent. The increase was primarily driven by benefits from higher interest rates, including lower premium amortization expense and loan growth, partially offset by lower net interest income related to Global Markets activity, higher rates paid on deposits and lower debt securities. For more information on net interest yield and FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6, and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 40. 

Noninterest Income 

Table 2 Noninterest Income Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Fees and commissions: Card income $ 1,469 &#160; $ 1,403 Service charges 1,410 &#160; 1,833 Investment and brokerage services 3,852 &#160; 4,292 Investment banking fees 1,163 &#160; 1,457 Total fees and commissions 7,894 &#160; 8,985 Market making and similar activities 4,712 &#160; 3,238 Other income (796) (567) Total noninterest income $ 11,810 &#160; $ 11,656 

Noninterest income increased $154 million to $11.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The following highlights the significant changes. 

&#9679; Service charges decreased $423 million primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes as well as lower treasury service charges. 

&#9679; Investment and brokerage services decreased $440 million primarily driven by lower market valuations and declines in assets under management (AUM) pricing, partially offset by the impact of positive AUM flows. 

&#9679; Investment banking fees decreased $294 million primarily due to lower debt issuance, advisory and equity issuance fees. 

&#9679; Market making and similar activities increased $1.5 billion primarily driven by improved performance in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) and by the impact of higher interest rates on client financing activities in Equities. 

&#9679; Other income decreased $229 million primarily due to losses on sales of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses increased $901 million to $931 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The provision for credit losses for the current-year period was driven by our consumer portfolio primarily due to higher-than-expected credit card balances, partially offset by certain improved macroeconomic conditions that primarily benefited our commercial portfolio. The provision for credit losses in the prior-year period was $30 million, as asset quality improvement was offset by a reserve build related to our Russian exposure and loan growth. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 36. 

Noninterest Expense 

Table 3 Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Compensation and benefits $ 9,918 &#160; $ 9,482 Occupancy and equipment 1,799 &#160; 1,760 Information processing and communications 1,697 &#160; 1,540 Product delivery and transaction related 890 &#160; 933 Marketing 458 &#160; 397 Professional fees 537 &#160; 450 Other general operating 939 &#160; 757 Total noninterest expense $ 16,238 &#160; $ 15,319 

Noninterest expense increased $919 million to $16.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher investments in people and technology and higher FDIC expense, partially offset by lower revenue-related incentive compensation. 

Income Tax Expense 

Table 4 Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Income before income taxes $ 9,089 &#160; $ 7,879 Income tax expense 928 &#160; 812 Effective tax rate 10.2 &#160; % 10.3 % 

The effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were primarily driven by our recurring tax preference benefits that mainly consist of tax credits from ESG investments in affordable housing and renewable energy. Absent ESG tax credits and discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rates would have been approximately 26 percent and 25 percent.

Supplemental Financial Data 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 

When presented on a consolidated basis, we view net interest income on an FTE basis as a non-GAAP financial measure. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. 

We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)), which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. 

We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders&#8217; equity or common shareholders&#8217; equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities (&#8220;adjusted&#8221; shareholders&#8217; equity or common shareholders&#8217; equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity and return on average tangible 

shareholders&#8217; equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are: 

&#9679; Return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. 

&#9679; Return on average tangible shareholders&#8217; equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. 

&#9679; Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. 

We believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. 

The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Table 5 on page 7. 

For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 43. 

Key Performance Indicators 

We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 94. 

Our consolidated key performance indicators, which include various equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 1 on page 4 and Table 5 on page 7. 

For information on key segment performance metrics, see Business Segment Operations on page 9.

Business Segment Operations 

Segment Description and Basis of Presentation 

We report our results of operations through four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. For more information, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital 

plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, including the definition of a reporting unit, see Note 7 &#8211; Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6, and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 17 &#8211; Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Key Performance Indicators 

We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators that management uses when evaluating segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our segments&#8217; operational performance, customer trends and business growth.

Consumer Banking, comprised of Deposits and Consumer Lending, offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small businesses. For more information about Consumer Banking , see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Consumer Banking Results 

Net income for Consumer Banking increased $130 million to $3.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 due to higher revenue, largely offset by an increase in provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $1.9 billion to $8.6 billion primarily driven by higher interest rates and loan balances. Noninterest income decreased $20 million to $2.1 billion, relatively unchanged from the same period a year ago. 

9 Bank of America 

The provision for credit losses increased $1.1 billion to $1.1 billion primarily driven by higher-than-expected credit card balances in the current-year period. Noninterest expense increased $552 million to $5.5 billion primarily driven by continued investments for business growth, including people and technology. 

The return on average allocated capital was 30 percent, unchanged from the same period a year ago. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 9. 

Deposits 

Net income for Deposits increased $837 million to $2.3 billion primarily due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $1.8 billion to $5.8 billion primarily due to higher interest rates. Noninterest income decreased $118 million to $785 million primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes. 

Noninterest expense increased $407 million to $3.4 billion primarily driven by continued investments for business growth, including people and technology. 

Average deposits decreased $28.9 billion to $1.0 trillion primarily due to net outflows of $15.0 billion in money market savings and $11.5 billion in checking. The decline was largely driven by clients moving deposits to higher yielding investment alternatives and higher levels of consumer spending . 

The table below provides key performance indicators for Deposits. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information to evaluate our deposit profitability and digital/mobile trends.

Consumer investment assets decreased $2.7 billion to $354.9 billion driven by market performance, partially offset by client flows. Active mobile banking users increased approximately three million, reflecting continuing changes in our clients&#8217; banking preferences. We had a net decrease of 164 financial centers and 552 ATMs as we continue to optimize our consumer banking network. 

Consumer Lending 

Net income for Consumer Lending decreased $707 million to $856 million primarily due to an increase in provision for credit 

losses. Net interest income increased $149 million to $2.8 billion due to higher interest rates and loan balances. Noninterest income increased $98 million to $1.3 billion primarily driven by card income. 

The provision for credit losses increased $1.0 billion to $906 million primarily driven by higher-than-expected credit card balances in the current-year period. Noninterest expense increased $145 million to $2.1 billion largely driven by continued investments for business growth, including people and technology. 

Average loans increased $19.8 billion to $299.7 billion primarily driven by an increase in credit card loans. 

The table below provides key performance indicators for Consumer Lending. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about loan growth and profitability.

First mortgage loan originations for Consumer Banking and the total Corporation decreased $6.2 billion and $12.4 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily driven by higher interest rates, resulting in lower customer demand. 

Home equity production in Consumer Banking and the total Corporation increased $458 million and $556 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily driven by higher demand.

GWIM consists of two primary businesses: Merrill Wealth Management and Bank of America Private Bank. For more information about GWIM , see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

Net income for GWIM decreased $217 million to $917 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily driven by lower revenue. The operating margin was 23 percent compared to 27 percent a year ago. 

Net interest income increased $208 million to $1.9 billion due to the impacts of higher interest rates and loan balances, partially offset by lower deposit balances. 

Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, decreased $369 million to $3.4 billion primarily due to the impacts of lower market valuations and declines in AUM pricing, partially offset by the impact of positive AUM flows. 

Noninterest expense increased $52 million to $4.1 billion primarily due to continued investments in the business, including strategic hiring and technology, largely offset by lower revenue-related incentives. 

The return on average allocated capital was 20 percent, down from 26 percent, due to lower net income and an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 9. 

Average loans increased $10.5 billion to $221.4 billion primarily due to residential mortgages and custom lending, partially offset by securities-based lending. Average deposits decreased $70.9 billion to $314.0 billion primarily driven by clients moving deposits to higher yielding investment alternatives. 

Merrill Wealth Management revenue of $4.4 billion decreased four percent primarily driven by the impact of lower market valuations and declines in AUM pricing, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates. 

Bank of America Private Bank revenue of $918 million increased three percent primarily driven by the benefits of higher interest rates, partially offset by the impact of lower market valuations.

For more information about Global Banking, s ee Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Net income for Global Banking increased $831 million to $2.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 driven by higher revenue and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. 

Net interest income increased $1.6 billion to $3.9 billion primarily due to the benefit of higher interest rates, partially offset by the impact of lower deposit balances. 

Noninterest income decreased $554 million to $2.3 billion driven by lower investment banking fees, lower treasury service charges due to higher earnings credit rates and lower revenue from ESG investment activities. 

The provision for credit losses improved $402 million to a benefit of $237 million primarily driven by certain improved macroeconomic conditions. 

Noninterest expense increased $257 million to $2.9 billion, primarily due to continued investments in the business, including strategic hiring in 2022. 

The return on average allocated capital was 21 percent, up from 16 percent, due to higher net income, partially offset by higher allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 9.

Global Markets offers sales and trading services and research services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. For more information about Global Markets , see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The following explanations for current period-over-period changes for Global Markets , including those disclosed under Sales and Trading Revenue, are the same for amounts including and excluding net DVA. Amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6. 

Net income for Global Markets increased $93 million to $1.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Net DVA gains were $14 million compared to $69 million in the same period in 2022. Excluding net DVA, net income increased $134 million to $1.7 billion. These increases were primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. 

Revenue increased $334 million to $5.6 billion primarily due to higher sales and trading revenue. Sales and trading revenue increased $348 million, and excluding net DVA, sales and trading revenue increased $403 million. These increases were driven by higher revenue in FICC, partially offset by lower revenue in Equities. 

Noninterest expense increased $234 million to $3.4 billion primarily driven by continued investments in the business, including people and technology. 

Average total assets increased $11.3 billion to $870.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 driven by loan growth in FICC. Period-end total assets increased $49.0 billion from December 31, 2022 to $861.5 billion driven by increased securities financing activity and higher levels of inventory in FICC to satisfy client demand. 

The return on average allocated capital was 15 percent, unchanged from the same period a year ago. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 9.

Equities net DVA gains were $3 million and $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Including and excluding net DVA, FICC revenue increased $732 million and $781 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily driven by improved trading performance across mortgage, credit and municipal products and increased secured financing activity. Including and excluding net DVA, Equities revenue decreased $384 million and $378 million driven by weaker trading performance and lower client activity in derivatives and cash.

All Other primarily consists of asset and liability management (ALM) activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all of the results are allocated to our business segments. For more information on our ALM activities, see Note 17 &#8211; Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The net loss in All Other decreased $257 million to a loss of $107 million primarily due to a higher income tax benefit, 

partially offset by lower noninterest income. 

Noninterest income decreased $121 million primarily due to $220 million of losses on sales of AFS debt securities, primarily offset by derivative gains related to risk management activities. 

The income tax benefit increased $252 million reflecting an increase in tax preference benefits primarily driven from income tax credits related to ESG investment activity. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking and Global Markets .

Managing Risk 

Risk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risk can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board. 

Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth roles and responsibilities for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. 

Our risk appetite provides a common framework that includes a set of measures to assist senior management and the Board in assessing the Corporation&#8217;s risk profile against our risk appetite and risk capacity. Our risk appetite is formally articulated in the Risk Appetite Statement, which includes both qualitative statements and quantitative limits. 

For more information on the Corporation&#8217;s risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks are being managed within our Risk Framework and supporting risk management programs. For more information on our Risk Framework, risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk section in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Capital Management 

The Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more information, including related regulatory requirements, see Capital Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

CCAR and Capital Planning 

The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan. Based on the results of our 2022 CCAR stress test, we are subject to a 3.4 percent stress capital buffer (SCB) from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. In April 2023, we submitted our 2023 CCAR capital plan and related supervisory stress tests. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it will disclose CCAR capital plan supervisory stress test results by June 30, 2023. 

In October 2021, the Board authorized the Corporation&#8217;s $25 billion common stock repurchase program. Additionally, the Board authorized common stock repurchases to offset shares awarded under the Corporation&#8217;s equity-based compensation plans. Pursuant to the Board&#8217;s authorizations, during the first quarter of 2023, we repurchased $2.2 billion of common stock, including repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans. 

The timing and amount of common stock repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation&#8217;s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). 

Regulatory Capital 

As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets (RWA) under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The lower of the capital ratios under Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements is used to assess capital adequacy, including under the PCA framework. As of March 31, 2023, the Common equity tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios under the Standardized approach were the binding ratios. 

Minimum Capital Requirements 

In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced approaches only), an SCB (under the Standardized approach only), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. For the period from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023, the Corporation's minimum CET1 capital ratio requirements are 10.4 percent under the Standardized approach and 9.5 percent under the Advanced approaches. 

The Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent with the approach prescribed by the Basel Committee&#8217;s assessment methodology and is calculated using specified indicators of systemic importance. Method 2 modifies the Method 1 approach by, among other factors, including a measure of the Corporation&#8217;s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. The Corporation&#8217;s G-SIB surcharge, which is higher under Method 2, is expected to increase to 3.0 percent from 2.5 percent on January 1, 2024, which will increase our minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement. At March 31, 2023, the Corporation&#8217;s CET1 capital ratio of 11.4 percent under the Standardized approach exceeded its current CET1 capital ratio requirement as well as the minimum requirement expected to be in place as of January 1, 2024 due to the anticipated increase in our G-SIB surcharge. 

The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.

(1) Capital ratios as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard on January 1, 2020. 

(2) The CET1 capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, our G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent and our capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced approaches) or the SCB of 3.4 percent (under the Standardized approach), as applicable, at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Corporation's SCB under the Standardized approach was 3.4 percent, the G-SIB surcharge was 2.5 percent and the countercyclical capital buffer was zero for both periods. The SLR regulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent. 

(3) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. 

(4) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions. 

At March 31, 2023, CET1 capital was $184.4 billion, an increase of $4.4 billion from December 31, 2022, primarily due to earnings, partially offset by dividends and common stock repurchases. Tier 1 capital increased $4.4 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital. Total capital under the Standardized approach increased $4.0 billion primarily due to the same factors driving the increase in Tier 1 capital and an increase in the adjusted allowance for credit losses included in Tier 2 capital, partially offset by a decrease in subordinated 

debt. RWA under the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at March 31, 2023, increased $17.0 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $1,622 billion primarily due to higher counterparty exposures in Global Markets . Supplementary leverage exposure at March 31, 2023 increased $31.4 billion primarily due to higher trading assets from increased business activities and higher cash held at central banks, partially offset by lower derivative exposures and debt securities balances.

(4) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions. 

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements 

Total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) consists of the Corporation&#8217;s Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt issued directly by the Corporation. Eligible long-term debt for TLAC ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements as prescribed in the TLAC final rule. As with the 

risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the Corporation is required to maintain TLAC ratios in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable buffers to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 11 presents the Corporation's TLAC and long-term debt ratios and related information as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation 

The Corporation&#8217;s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &#38; Smith Incorporated (MLPF&#38;S). The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE). 

The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and MLPCC and MLPF&#38;S compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers. 

BofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $5.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $1.0 billion or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement in addition to a certain percentage of securities-based swap risk margin. BofAS must also notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its customers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At March 31, 2023, BofAS had tentative net capital of $19.3 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $17.1 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $4.5 billion. 

MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provides clearing and settlement services as well as prime brokerage and arranged financing services for institutional clients. At March 31, 2023, MLPCC&#8217;s regulatory net capital of $7.1 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.5 billion. 

MLPF&#38;S provides retail services. At March 31, 2023, MLPF&#38;S' regulatory net capital was $6.3 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $137 million. 

Our European broker-dealers are subject to requirements from U.S. and non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the FCA and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At 

March 31, 2023, MLI&#8217;s capital resources were $33.5 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $11.7 billion. 

BofASE, an authorized credit institution with its head office located in France, is regulated by the Autorit&#233; de Contr&#244;le Prudentiel et de R&#233;solution and the Autorit&#233; des March&#233;s Financiers, and supervised under the Single Supervisory Mechanism by the European Central Bank. At March 31, 2023, BofASE's capital resources were $9.1 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $3.3 billion. 

In addition, MLI and BofASE became conditionally registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers in the fourth quarter of 2021, and maintained net liquid assets at March 31, 2023 that exceeded the applicable minimum requirements under the Exchange Act. 

Liquidity Risk 

Funding and Liquidity Risk Management 

Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements, including payments under long-term debt agreements, commitments to extend credit and customer deposit withdrawals, while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market stress from increased volatility due to the failure of certain financial institutions in March 2023. For more information, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; Financial Market Events on page 3. Our practices have also allowed us to effectively manage market fluctuations from the rising interest rate environment, inflationary pressures and changes in the macroeconomic environment. 

We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise. We manage our liquidity position through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor 

21 Bank of America 

liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information on the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity risks, see the Liquidity section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

NB Holdings Corporation 

Bank of America Corporation, as the parent company (the Parent), which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, has an intercompany arrangement with our wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, NB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings). We have transferred, and agreed to transfer, additional Parent assets not required to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures to NB Holdings. The Parent is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had it not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the Parent would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets 

We maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the Parent and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer, referred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), is comprised of assets that are readily available to the Parent and selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a lesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and other investment-grade securities, and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We can obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our GLS in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities. 

Table 12 presents average GLS for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

$ 854 &#160; $ 868 

(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. 

Our bank subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental 

liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $319 billion and $348 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the Parent or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval. 

Liquidity is also held in nonbank entities, including the Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. The Parent and NB Holdings liquidity is typically in the form of cash deposited at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at bank subsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the Parent or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. 

Table 13 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Table 13 Average Global Liquidity Sources Composition Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) March 31 2023 December 31 2022 Cash on deposit $ 204 &#160; $ 174 U.S. Treasury securities 225 &#160; 252 U.S. agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and other investment-grade securities 411 &#160; 427 Non-U.S. government securities 14 &#160; 15 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources $ 854 &#160; $ 868 

Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution&#8217;s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $591 billion and $605 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 117 percent and 120 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity. 

Liquidity Stress Analysis 

We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the Parent 

Bank of America 22 

and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk &#8211;Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Net Stable Funding Ratio 

The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The requirement is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. At March 31, 2023, the Corporation and its insured depository institutions were in compliance with this requirement. 

Diversified Funding Sources 

We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally 

coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.91 trillion and $1.93 trillion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. 

Deposits 

Our deposit base is well-diversified by clients, geography and product type across our business segments. At March 31, 

2023, 55 percent of our deposits were in Consumer Banking , 16 percent in GWIM and 26 percent in Global Banking . We consider a substantial portion of our deposit base to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of liquidity. At March 31, 2023, approximately 67 percent of consumer and small business deposits and 80 percent of U.S. deposits in Global Banking were held by clients who have had accounts with us for 10 or more years. In addition, at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 33 percent and 34 percent of our deposits were noninterest-bearing and included operating accounts of our consumer and commercial clients. Deposits at March 31, 2023 decreased $19.9 billion, or one percent, from December 31, 2022 primarily due to clients in GWIM moving deposits into higher yielding investment alternatives. Period-end deposits for Consumer Banking and Global Banking were relatively stable at March 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022. 

Long-term Debt 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we issued $14.3 billion of long-term debt consisting of $3.8 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, which were largely TLAC compliant, $4.4 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $6.1 billion of other debt. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $11.3 billion consisting of $8.9 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $500 million for Bank of America, N.A. and $1.9 billion of other debt.

For more information on our TLAC eligible and callable outstanding notes, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; Diversified Funding Sources in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

(2) Represents liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) included in total long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Total long-term debt increased $7.9 billion to $283.9 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to debt issuances and valuation adjustments, partially offset by debt maturities and redemptions. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our 

other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023 , we issued $4.0 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. These structured notes are typically issued to meet client demand, and notes with certain 

23 Bank of America 

attributes may also be TLAC eligible. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. 

Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more information on long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 11 &#8211; Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 40. 

Credit Ratings 

Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Table 15 presents the Corporation&#8217;s current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies. 

The ratings and outlooks from Fitch Ratings for the Corporation and its subsidiaries have not changed from those disclosed in the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

On March 31, 2023, Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Global Ratings (S&#38;P) affirmed the current ratings of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, while at the same time revising its rating outlook to Stable from Positive. S&#38;P concurrently changed its outlooks on three other large U.S. bank holding companies to Stable from Positive, noting that the agency has reduced its upside expectations for bank ratings in the near term. 

On January 23, 2023, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service (Moody&#8217;s) placed the long-term rating of the Corporation as well as the long-term rating of its rated subsidiaries, including BANA, on review for upgrade. The agency cited the Corporation&#8217;s strengthened capital ratios, improved earnings profile and continued commitment to maintaining a restrained risk appetite as drivers of the review. Moody&#8217;s concurrently affirmed all Prime-1 short-term ratings of the Corporation and rated subsidiaries. A review for upgrade indicates that those ratings are under consideration for a change in the near term and typically concludes within 90 days. As of May 1, 2023, Moody&#8217;s had not yet announced the completion of its review of the long-term ratings. 

For more information on additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contracts and other trading agreements in the event of a credit rating downgrade, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Item 1A.

Credit Risk Management 

For information on our credit risk management activities, see the following: Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management, Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 29, Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 35, Allowance for Credit Losses on page 36, and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For information on the Corporation&#8217;s loan modification programs, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, our asset quality remained relatively healthy. Our net charge-off ratio increased primarily driven by credit card loans, as delinquency trends continue to slowly increase off of historic lows; however, they remain below pre-pandemic levels. Nonperforming loans increased modestly compared to December 31, 2022 driven by office, while commercial reservable criticized exposure increased driven by both office as well as other industries that have been impacted by the current environment. Uncertainty remains regarding broader economic impacts as a result of inflationary pressures, rising rates and the current geopolitical environment and could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods. 

Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower&#8217;s credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics 

to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources, such as credit bureaus, and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. 

Consumer Credit Portfolio 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the U.S. unemployment rate remained relatively stable and home prices continued to decline modestly. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, net charge-offs increased $313 million to $653 million compared to the same period in 2022, as late-stage delinquent credit card loans were charged off. 

The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses increased $124 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $7.4 billion. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 36. 

For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and loan modifications for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics. 

Residential Mortgage 

The residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 51 percent of consumer loans and leases at March 31, 2023. Approximately 51 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in 

Consumer Banking, 45 percent was in GWIM and the remaining portion was in All Other . 

Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio decreased $843 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023, as paydowns outpaced new originations. 

At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the residential mortgage portfolio included $11.4 billion and $11.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion had FHA insurance, with the remainder protected by Fannie Mae long-term standby agreements. 

Table 18 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio. The following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio.

(1) Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. 

(2) Includes loans that are contractually current that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a modification. 

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio decreased $42 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to returns to performing and paydowns outpacing new additions. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at March 31, 2023, $1.3 billion, or 63 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $120 million. 

Of the $217.4 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at March 31, 2023, 28 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period was $3.4 billion, or six percent, at March 31, 2023. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally experience a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At March 31, 2023, $64 million, or two percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $724 million, or less than one percent, for the entire residential 

mortgage portfolio. In addition, at March 31, 2023, $185 million, or five percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $67 million were contractually current. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of 3 to 10 years. Approximately 96 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2025 or later. 

Table 19 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 14 percent of outstandings at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 15 percent of outstandings at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Home Equity 

At March 31, 2023, the home equity portfolio made up six percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages. 

At March 31, 2023, 82 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , eight percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $695 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to paydowns outpacing draws on existing lines and new 

originations. Of the total home equity portfolio at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $10.7 billion and $11.1 billion, or 41 percent and 42 percent, were in first-lien positions. At March 31, 2023, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $4.4 billion, or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio. 

Unused HELOCs totaled $44.0 billion and $42.4 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The HELOC utilization rate was 36 percent and 38 percent at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(2) Includes loans that are contractually current that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a modification. 

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $22 million to $488 million at March 31, 2023, primarily driven by returns to performing status and paydowns outpacing new additions. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at March 31, 2023, $265 million, or 54 percent, were current on contractual payments, and $144 million, or 29 percent, were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due remained relatively unchanged during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

Net recoveries decreased $18 million to $12 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. 

Of the $25.9 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at March 31, 2023, as shown in Table 20, 12 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that had reached the end of their draw period and 

entered the amortization period was $4.9 billion at March 31, 2023. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At March 31, 2023, $50 million, or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at March 31, 2023, $329 million, or seven percent, were nonperforming. 

For our interest-only HELOC portfolio, we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines; however, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and is still in its revolving period. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, 23 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs.

Credit Card 

At March 31, 2023, 97 percent of the credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the credit card portfolio decreased $952 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $92.5 billion primarily driven by a seasonal decline in purchase volumes. Net charge-offs increased $204 million to $501 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, as late-stage credit card delinquencies were 

charged off. Credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $169 million, and 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $111 million. 

Unused lines of credit for credit card increased to $381.1 billion at March 31, 2023 from $370.1 billion at December 31, 2022. 

Table 22 presents certain state concentrations for the credit card portfolio.

Direct/Indirect Consumer 

At March 31, 2023, 51 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and recreational vehicle lending) and 49 percent was included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans). Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio decreased $1.7 billion during the 

three months ended March 31, 2023 to $104.5 billion driven by declines in securities-based lending stemming from higher paydown activity due to higher interest rates, partially offset by growth in our auto portfolio. 

Table 23 presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio.

Other Consumer 

Other consumer primarily consists of deposit overdraft balances. Net charge-offs increased $83 million to $162 million 

during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, primarily driven by higher overdraft losses due to industry-wide check fraud activity.

Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity 

Table 24 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, nonperforming consumer loans decreased $40 million to $2.7 billion primarily due to returns to performing status and paydowns outpacing new additions during the first quarter of 2023. 

At March 31, 2023, $550 million, or 20 percent, of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs 7to sell. In addition, at March 31, 2023, $1.6 billion, or 60 percent, of nonperforming consumer loans were current and classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. 

Foreclosed properties decreased $4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $117 million.

Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management 

Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 29, 31 and 34 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Table 31 and Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Industry Concentrations on page 33. 

For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, net charge-offs and loan modifications for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 

Commercial Credit Portfolio 

Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $4.9 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2023 due to growth in commercial real estate and our U.S. commercial and industrial portfolio, primarily in Global Banking . During the three months ended March 31, 2023, commercial credit quality deteriorated and nonperforming commercial loans and reservable criticized utilized exposure increased; however, the 

commercial net charge off ratio of 0.11 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2023 remained low. For more information, see Commercial Real Estate on page 31. 

With the exception of the office property type, which is further discussed in the Commercial Real Estate section herein, credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers has remained relatively stable since December 31, 2022; however, we are closely monitoring borrower performance in the increased rate environment and emerging trends. Many commercial real estate markets are still experiencing disruptions in demand, supply chain challenges, tenant difficulties and challenging capital markets. Recent demand for office space has been stagnant, and future demand for office space continues to be uncertain as companies evaluate space needs with employment models that utilize a mix of remote and conventional office use. 

The commercial allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $292 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $5.2 billion, primarily driven by certain improved macroeconomic conditions. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 36. 

Total commercial utilized credit exposure decreased $4.2 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $700.7 billion primarily driven by lower derivative assets, partially offset by higher loans and leases. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 56 percent at both March 31, 2023 and at December 31, 2022.

Table 25 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance 

funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

Commercial and Industrial 

Commercial and industrial loans include U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios. 

U.S. Commercial 

At March 31, 2023, 64 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 21 percent in Global Markets , 14 percent in GWIM (loans that provide financing for asset purchases, business investments and other liquidity needs for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans increased $2.2 billion, or one percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily driven by Global Markets . Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $408 million, or four percent, driven by increases across a broad range of industries. 

Non-U.S. Commercial 

At March 31, 2023, 65 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking, 34 percent in Global Markets and the remainder in GWIM . Non-U.S. commercial loans remained relatively unchanged during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $302 million, or 11 percent, primarily due to paydowns and sales of Russian exposure. For information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 35. 

Commercial Real Estate 

Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans increased $3.3 billion, or five percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $73.1 billion with increases across multiple property types. The commercial real estate portfolio is primarily managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 19 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $378 million, or seven percent, primarily driven by office loans. Office loans represented the largest property type concentration, at 26 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at March 31, 2023, but only represented approximately two percent of total loans for the Corporation. This property type is roughly 75 percent Class A and has origination loan-to-value of approximately 55 percent. Reservable criticized exposure for the office property type was $3.7 billion at March 31, 2023 and approximately $9.8 billion of office loans are scheduled to mature by the end of 2024. Although we have seen collateral value declines in this property type, these loans remain well secured as of March 31, 2023. 

31 Bank of America 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we continued to see low default rates. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures for management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan 

restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.

U.S. Small Business Commercial 

The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans primarily managed in Consumer Banking, and included $749 million and $1.0 billion of PPP loans outstanding at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The decline of $259 million in PPP loans during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily due to repayment of the loans by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the terms of the program. Excluding PPP, credit card-related products were 55 percent and 53 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and represented 99 percent of the net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 100 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase of $94 million in accruing past due 90 days or more for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was driven by PPP loans, which are fully guaranteed by the SBA. 

Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity 

Table 30 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $150 million to $1.2 billion. At March 31, 2023, 97 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured, and 58 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 84 percent of their unpaid principal balance, as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.

(2) Includes U.S. small business commercial activity. Small business card loans are excluded as they are not classified as nonperforming. 

(3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection, or when a modified loan demonstrates a sustained period of payment performance. 

(4) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. 

Industry Concentrations 

Table 31 presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry. For information on net notional credit protection purchased to hedge funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Risk Mitigation. 

Commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure decreased $3.8 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $1.2 trillion and was primarily driven by derivative asset activity. 

For information on industry limits, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Industry Concentrations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Asset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $164.5 billion, decreased $607 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $101.1 billion, increased $1.4 billion, or 

one percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2023. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Commercial Real Estate on page 31. 

Capital goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $88.1 billion, increased $746 million, or one percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in committed exposure occurred primarily as a result of increases in Trading companies and distributors and Aerospace and defense, partially offset by a decrease in Electric equipment. 

There is uncertainty in the U.S. and global economies due to various macroeconomic challenges including geopolitical, inflationary pressures and elevated interest rates, and a number of industries will likely continue to be adversely impacted due to these conditions. We continue to monitor all industries, particularly higher risk industries that are experiencing or could experience a more significant impact to their financial condition.

(2) Includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments, net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $10.1 billion and $10.4 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

(3) Industries are viewed from a variety of perspectives to best isolate the perceived risks. For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors. 

Risk Mitigation 

We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. 

At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $9.8 billion and $9.0 billion. We recorded net losses of $77 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to net losses of $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The gains and losses on these instruments were largely offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 37. For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 38.

Non-U.S. Portfolio 

Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal 

course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather than through country risk governance. For more information on our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios, see Non-U.S. Portfolio in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on risks related to our non-U.S. portfolio, see the Geopolitical section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Table 34 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at March 31, 2023. These exposures accounted for 89 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Net country exposure for these 20 countries decreased $23.7 billion in 2023 primarily driven by decreases in Germany, Japan and France.

Our largest non-U.S. country exposure at March 31, 2023 was the United Kingdom with net exposure of $54.8 billion, which represents a decrease of $500 million from December 31, 2022. The decline was driven by decreased exposure across a mix of clients offset by increased net 

counterparty exposure with central clearing counterparties. Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure of $36.1 billion at March 31, 2023, a decrease of $9.6 billion from December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by lower deposits with the central bank.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses decreased $271 million from December 31, 2022 to $14.0 billion at March 31, 2023, which included a $123 million reserve increase related to the consumer portfolio and a $394 million reserve decrease related to the commercial portfolio. The decrease in the allowance reflected a reserve release in our commercial portfolio primarily driven by certain improved macroeconomic conditions, partially offset by a reserve build in our consumer portfolio primarily due to higher-than-expected credit card balances during the three 

months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in allowance also includes the impact of the accounting change to remove the recognition and measurement guidance on TDRs, which reduced the allowance for credit losses by $243 million. For more information on this change in accounting guidance, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were $807 million and increased $415 million, or 106 percent, compared to $392 million for the same period in 2022 primarily driven by credit card losses increasing off of historic lows and higher overdraft losses due to an increase in industry-wide check fraud activity. The provision for credit losses increased $901 million to $931 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was driven by our consumer portfolio primarily due to higher-than-expected credit card balances during the first quarter of 2023. This was partially offset by certain improved macroeconomic conditions that primarily benefited our commercial portfolio. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $932 million to $946 million for the three months 

ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $165 million to $149 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.

Market Risk Management 

For more information on our market risk management process, see Market Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on market risks, see the Market section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results. 

Trading Risk Management 

To evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. 

Table 37 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR, which is the combination of the total covered positions (and

The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 37 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. 

Table 37 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 using a 99 percent confidence level. The amounts disclosed in Table 37 and Table 38 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. 

The average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior quarter slightly decreased due to reductions in market making inventory across FICC and improved diversification across asset classes.

The following graph presents the daily covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 37. 

Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 38 at the same level of detail as in Table 37. Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio, as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 38 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022.

Backtesting 

The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Backtesting in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, there were no days where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. 

Total Trading-related Revenue 

Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more 

information, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Total Trading-related Revenue in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 98 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three months ended December 31, 2022 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 85 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million.

Trading Portfolio Stress Testing 

Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For more information, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book 

The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Table 39 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

For more information on the transition from LIBOR to ARRs, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates on page 3. 

Table 40 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically, we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at zero. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the overall decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to higher and lower rate scenarios was primarily due to changes in deposit product mix and risk management activities performed in our ALM portfolio to respond to changing market conditions. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale and adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income generated from the banking book activities. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Capital on page 17.

The sensitivity analysis in Table 40 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. 

Bank of America 40 

The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 40 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, the increase in net interest income would be impacted by any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding as our benefit in those scenarios would be reduced. Conversely, in lower-rate scenarios, any customer activity that results in the replacement of higher yielding deposits or market-based funding with low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits would reduce our exposure in those scenarios. 

For interest rate scenarios larger than 100 bps shifts, it is expected that the interest rate sensitivity will illustrate non-linear behaviors as there are numerous estimates and assumptions, which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated, that could impact the outcome. Pertaining to the mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage portfolio, if long-end interest rates were to significantly decrease over the next twelve months, for example over 200 bps, there would generally be an increase in customer prepayment behaviors with an incremental reduction to net interest income, noting that the extent of changes in customer prepayment activity can be impacted by multiple factors and is not necessarily limited to long-end interest rates. Conversely, if long-end interest rates were to significantly increase over the next twelve months, for example, over 200 bps, customer prepayments would likely modestly decrease and result in an incremental increase to net interest income. In addition, deposit pricing will have non-linear impacts to larger short-end rate movements. In decreasing interest rate scenarios, and particularly where interest rates have decreased to small amounts, the ability to further reduce rates paid is reduced as customer rates near zero. In higher short-end rate scenarios, deposit pricing will likely increase at a faster rate, leading to incremental interest expense and reducing asset sensitivity. While the impact related to the above assumptions used in the asset sensitivity analysis can provide directional analysis on how net interest income will be impacted in changing environments, the ultimate impact is dependent upon the interrelationship of the assumptions and factors, which vary in different macroeconomic scenarios. 

Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts 

We use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options. 

The derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in Table 40. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives 

in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is not significant. 

Risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the Corporation&#8217;s non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is not significant. For more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Mortgage Banking Risk Management 

We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. 

Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

There were no significant gains or losses related to the change in fair value of MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Climate Risk Management 

Climate-related risks are divided into two major categories: (1) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, driven by extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods, as well as chronic longer-term shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels, and (2) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes. These changes and events may have broad impacts on operations, supply chains, distribution networks, customers and markets and are otherwise referred to, respectively, as physical risk and transition risk. These risks may impact both financial and nonfinancial risk types. Physical climate events may lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers&#8217; repayment capacity or collateral value, or increased operational risk by impacting the Corporation&#8217;s facilities, employees, customers or vendors. Climate-related transition changes in policy, technology or the market may amplify credit risk through financial impacts to the Corporation or its customers or counterparties or increase market risk, including through sudden price adjustments. In addition, reputational risk may arise, including from our climate-related practices, disclosures and commitments. 

41 Bank of America 

As climate risk spans all key risk types, we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our Risk Framework and risk management programs established for each of our seven key types of risk. 

We publicly announced our commitment to achieve net zero emissions in our financing activities, operations, and supply chain before 2050 (Net Zero Goal). In connection with our Net Zero Goal, we set certain 2030 targets, including reducing emissions associated with our operations and financing activities, related to auto manufacturing, energy and power generation, and for our supply chain, including that a certain proportion of our global suppliers set their own climate targets (2030 Targets). We disclosed our 2019 and 2020 financed emission and emission intensity metrics for the above referenced sectors in our 2022 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report, with 2019 serving as the baseline for our financed emissions targets. 

We plan to disclose the financed emissions for additional portions of our business loan portfolio in 2023, and we plan to set financing activity emission reduction targets for other key sectors by April 2024. 

Achieving our climate-related goals and targets, including our Net Zero Goal and 2030 Targets, may require technological advances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors, new standards and public policies, including those that improve the cost of capital for the transition to a low-carbon economy and better emissions data reporting, as well as ongoing, strong and active engagement with customers, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders. 

Given the extended period of these and other climate-related goals we have established, our initiatives have not resulted in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position in the relevant periods presented herein.

Complex Accounting Estimates 

Our significant accounting principles, are essential in understanding the MD&#38;A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments.
